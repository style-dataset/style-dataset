B000FC0NQ40,B000FC0NQ4,"Anyone who lives in Boston knows that it’s March that’s the cruelest, holding out a few days of false hope and then gleefully hitting you with the shit. Today is one of the untrustworthy ones when it looks as if spring might really be coming, and he’s thinking about taking a walk when the bit of impending nastiness just ahead is over. Of course at this point, Jonesy has no idea how nasty a day can get; no idea that he is going to finish this one in a hospital room, smashed up and fighting for his goddam life.

Same shit, different day, he thinks, but this will be different shit indeed.

That’s when the phone rings, and he grabs it at once, filled with a hopeful premonition: it’ll be the Defuniak kid, calling to cancel his eleven-o’clock. He’s gotten a whiff of what’s in the wind, Jonesy thinks, and that is very possible. Usually it’s the students who make appointments to see the teacher. When a kid gets a message saying that one of his teachers wants to see him . . . well, you don’t have to be a rocket-scientist, as the saying goes.

“ Hello, it’s Jones,” he says."
B000FC0NQ41,B000FC0NQ4,"This is a bona fide case of same shit, different day. Do you know that?

“ What does that mean, Henry? What does that mean to you?

“Everything,” he says, eyes closed, and then adds: “Nothing. ” But that’s a lie. Not the first one that was ever told in here.

He lies on the couch, eyes closed and hands folded on his chest, and after a little while he sleeps.

The next day the four of them drive up to Hole in the Wall, and it is a great eight days. The great hunting trips are coming to an end, only a few left, although they of course do not know this. The real darkness is still a few years away, but it is coming.

The darkness is coming.

2001: Jonesy’s Student-Teacher Conference

We don’t know the days that will change our lives. Probably just as well. On the day that will change his, Jonesy is in his third-floor John Jay College office, looking out at his little slice of Boston and thinking how wrong T. S. Eliot had been to call April the cruelest month just because an itinerant carpenter from Nazareth supposedly got himself crucified then for fomenting rebellion."
B01BSGFICO0,B01BSGFICO,"In the olden days, homesickness wasn’t a problem because the cabins had been rented by families. That was how camp used to work. As soon as the school year ended, the moms and kids would move into the bungalows, and each weekend, the dads would come to join them, taking the train up from the city. That was where the term “bungalow colony” came from. A colony was a group of bungalows set close together. Often, Nana had told her, the same families returned year after year. They became close friends with the other camp families, even though they never got to see each other except in the summer, and they looked forward to camp all year.

Nana had pictures of the olden days, and they looked like happy times, frozen in black-and-white photographs with deckled edges, preserved in the black-paged camp albums that went back to the Beginning of Time. The dads smoked pipes and drank highballs and leaned on their tennis racquets. Nearby were the moms in their kerchiefs and middy blouses, sunning themselves in bent-willow lawn chairs while the kids all played together.

Lolly wished life could really be like that. Nowadays, of course, it couldn’t. Women had careers and a bunch of them didn’t have husbands."
B01BSGFICO1,B01BSGFICO,"Each year, she came to Camp Kioga with ridiculously high expectations. This summer will be different. This summer, I’ll make new friends, learn a sport, live my own life, just for one single season.

But once things got under way, reality set in. Simply leaving the city didn’t mean leaving discontent behind. It came along with her, like a shadow, expanding and contracting with the light.

She and Connor Davis were the last to reach the summit. Everyone else was gathered around the fire pit. There was no fire because it was plenty hot and sunny. The campers sat on huge old logs. Some of the logs had been there so long they had seats worn into them.

The head counselors of Eagle Lodge this year were Rourke McKnight and Gabby Spaulding, who fit the Kioga mold perfectly. They were cute and perky. Each had attended Kioga as a camper. Now in college, they embodied what Nana and Granddad called the Kioga “esprit de corps. ” They knew the camp rules, CPR, several key Algonquin words and the tunes of every campfire song known to man. They understood how to talk a camper out of feeling homesick. Among the Fledglings especially, homesickness was a dreaded epidemic."
B06WPBWQMM0,B06WPBWQMM,"Churning, roiling, and swirling back the way we’d come. Toward the Enyi Zinariya village. Away from my dying, maybe even dead, family.

I weakly raised my hands and moved them slowly, typing in the air. The various names of my father. Moaoogo Dambu Kaipka Okechukwu. I tried to send it. But they wouldn’t go. I rolled my head to the side in the sand, feeling the grains ground into my otjize-rolled okuoko, blue tentacles layered with sweet-smelling red clay and now sand. I tried to call Okwu. I tried to reach it. To touch it with my mind as I had days ago, now. Again, nothing.

Then I started weeping, as the world around me began to do that expanding thing that it had been doing since we’d left the Ariya’s cavern over a day ago. As if everything were growing bigger and bigger and bigger, though it was still the same. Mwinyi said it was just my body settling with the zinariya technology that Ariya had unlocked within me, but what did that matter? It didn’t make it any better. The sensation was so jarring that I constantly felt the Earth would decide to fling me into space at any moment."
B06WPBWQMM1,B06WPBWQMM,"The dogs were running all around us, at least as far as I could see, which was only a few feet. Our camel Rakumi was roaring with distress. I was seeing words now as Mwinyi desperately tried to reach me using the zinariya.

The floating green words said, “Sandstorm. Dog pack. Relax. Grab Rakumi’s saddle, Binti. ”

I am not a follower, but there are times when all you can do is follow. And so yet again, I submitted. This time it was to Mwinyi, a boy I had only known for a few days, of a people I’d viewed as barbarians all my life and now knew were not, my father’s people, my people.

I was breaking and breaking and into that moment I followed Mwinyi. He led us out of that sandstorm.

* * *

The sun broke through.

The air cleared of dust.

The storm was behind us.

I sighed, relieved. Then the weight of the sudden quiet made my legs buckle and I sank to the ground at the hooves of our camel Rakumi. I pressed my cheek to the sand and was surprised by its warmth. There I lay, staring at the retreating sandstorm. It looked like a large brown beast who’d decided to leave, when really it just happened to travel the other way."
B00C0ALY9O0,B00C0ALY9O,"THE APARTMENT ON Rue de Naples was in Montmartre, the highest point in the city. Fanny was pleased to get a whole floor for fifteen dollars a month, plus two dollars for the concierge. It had a formal dining room with tall mirrors, and a kitchen with a porcelain stove and a hydrant that brought artesian water up to the apartment at no extra charge. Her building was full of artists and poets who had formed a tight little community.

Once Hervey’s health was improving, Fanny went out with the surgeon she’d met on the ship from New York. He would show up with a liveried attendant whose sole purpose was to remove the surgeon’s elegant cape when he arrived and put it back on him when it was time to leave. Fanny didn’t doubt Hendricks’s interest and delight in her, but she suspected he was only pretending to be a serious suitor, and that his annual trips were personal dramas in which he acted the dashing American abroad. He needed a ladylove on his arm, and she found it amusing to play the part as he gadded about Paris looking romantic, with his shirt collar turned up and his cravat tied in a bow à la Byron."
B00C0ALY9O1,B00C0ALY9O,"More than once, Monsieur Julian had put up her drawing as the best of the day. If only she opened her eyes to it, Belle could experience a finer kind of beauty in Paris than Fanny had encountered in Indianapolis or San Francisco. With enough study, she could actually be a professional artist—a portraitist rather than a painter of pottery. That was what many of these women would do: return home and make a reputation by doing portraiture or pursuing teaching.

Fanny glanced at the clock and saw their time was nearly up. She worked faster, adding shadow to her study. But the model was breaking her pose. The woman stepped off the platform and slipped a camisole over her head. The sight of her red pubic hair caused Fanny to feel awkward. An underskirt came next, then a dress. This is no place for modesty, she reasoned. And yet it seemed somehow unprofessional for the model to be so abrupt as she slipped out of her classic pose and climbed into her clothes right there in front of all the students. The models should go behind a screen to avoid creating the reaction Fanny was feeling now—as if a lovely dream had been interrupted."
B0027MJU500,B0027MJU50,"Sara brought a beautifully wrapped, lacquered picture frame with a photo of the four of them standing out in front of their college apartment. Mel brought a bottle of Dos Amigos tequila.

Stewart closed the back door. “ Are we ready, ladies? ”

“I’ll ride up front with Stewart,” Mel said, quickly climbing into the front seat.

It was a forty-minute drive from the airport to the Whale Head Island Ferry, long enough for Sara and Mel to sober up. They drove down narrow asphalt roads surrounded on both sides by wide flat fields of marsh grass. Late-afternoon sun shimmered across the landscape, and high overhead a hawk soared, circling above the distant tree line. Sara’s cell phone rang once but she didn’t answer it. It was Tom, calling to see if she’d arrived. She couldn’t talk to him here, in front of everyone. A faint feeling of homesickness stirred her bowels. They’d been married for seventeen years, and in all that time had never been apart for more than two nights. She thought of her husband’s smile, of her children’s sweet faces, and the homesickness swelled to a thick lump in her throat. Away from them she felt only half herself.

Annie, as if reading her mind, asked, “How’re Tom and the kids? ”"
B0027MJU501,B0027MJU50,"“Crack it yourself,” Annie said. “I’m on vacation. ”

The car sent to take them to the ferry was a long white Escalade with twelve-spoke wheels. “ That car has Briggs written all over it,” Mel said as it pulled up in front of the airport. A young man wearing a blue polo shirt and khaki pants opened the driver’s door and jumped out. “ You must be Mrs. Furman’s friends,” he said, coming around to take their bags. “ I’m Stewart. I’ll be your driver today. ” He grinned and Mel grinned back.

“ Where’s Mrs. Furman? ”

“ Oh, she’s back at the boat with Captain Mike. They’re waiting for you at the ferry landing. ”

Mel looked at Sara and mouthed Captain Mike. Sara shrugged and helped Stewart load her bags into the back of the Escalade.

“ Careful with that cooler,” Annie said. “It’s got deviled eggs in there. ”

“ You brought deviled eggs to the beach? ”

“ Well, I couldn’t just come empty-handed, could I? ”

No, of course she couldn’t. They were all Southern girls and had been raised to come bearing gifts. What each woman brought said a lot about her personality."
B00UQH820M0,B00UQH820M,"While Ray pulled out a blank piece of paper to draw a diagram of the house, Griffin returned my suspicious gaze with a teasing twist of his lips.

“ So your grandfather is an astronaut? ”

I nodded. “ Yep. ”

“ And your mom, she’s the senator, right? ”

“ That’s right. ”

“ Didn’t your grandma work on the atomic bomb, or something? ”

“Something like that. ” My maternal grandmother was a physicist. She didn’t work directly on the Manhattan project, but she did help the US government equip the earliest nuclear submarines.

“Must be weird coming from such a famous family. ”

I wrinkled my nose. “ We’re not famous. ”

“ That’s not true. You’re like American royalty. Isn’t your dad the president of something? ”

“ No. He’s a dean at a college of medicine. ”

Griffin blew out a low whistle, his gaze growing less appraising and more introspective. He sat up straighter, his face and tone becoming serious, almost reverent. “ So, you’re like really smart then, right? What are you going to do? What’s your major? You’ll probably cure cancer or something. ”

I stared at him for a beat, not wanting to respond. I was proud of my family, but their accomplishments were not my accomplishments, their ambitions were not my ambitions."
B00UQH820M1,B00UQH820M,"If we were sleeping with each other then we couldn’t be doing more than sleeping with anyone else.

I left the bed quietly, showered, changed into shorts and a T-shirt, then went in search of Martin. I found Ray and Griffin first. They were on the multi-level balcony that ran the length of the back of the house. To my surprise, they were studying.

Ray informed me that Martin might not be up yet as it was one of the only mornings they’d planned not to practice.

“ He tries to sleep in for as long as possible if there’s no practice,” Ray explained. “ But I can tell you where his room is. I don’t think he’d mind if you woke him up. ”

“ Hmm … ” I hesitated. I didn’t want to interrupt his sleep, especially if he rarely had an opportunity to sleep in.

“ I don’t think he’d mind at all,” Griffin added with a dimpled grin, his brown eyes moving in slow appraisal from my ankles to my eyes.

I gave him a narrowed glare. He looked like the type to eat lo mein leftovers if given the opportunity.

“ Sure, okay,” I said to Ray. “ Can you draw me a map? ”"
B01MA1XICQ0,B01MA1XICQ,"In consideration of the facts, we, the both of us, have reason for embarrassment with our families, we are protective and willing to defend those we love, and we have tempers which are easily stirred and shared without reserve when our loved ones are threatened. Do you not agree? ”

“Very much so. ”

Darcy’s nature was to contemplate a solution as soon as a problem was brought to his attention. He wanted to take charge; to fix things. Under this situation, it simply would not do. He owed it to her to give his full attention to her words.

“My father prides himself on having raised his second daughter to be a studier of character who is possessed of a quick mind based on reason. ”

“ I agree with Mr. Bennet. ” Elizabeth’s intelligence and wit was what had held his attention. Her fine eyes were what had caught it in the first place.

“While I thank you, Mr. Darcy, the simple truth is I allowed my prejudices to colour not only my opinion of you, but Mr. Wickham as well. ” She exhaled loudly. “ Not until now have I understood how foolish I have been to display pride in my ability to quickly discern the truth of a matter. I am wretched at what I have learned about my own character since my arrival in Kent. ”

He hurried to disabuse her of that notion."
B01MA1XICQ1,B01MA1XICQ,"He had to sit down! A fallen log at the edge of the forest beckoned him to find relief for the weakness attacking his knees at her words. She followed him, and gratitude filled him from his head to his toes. Elizabeth sat next to him, though not close enough to touch.

It took a while before his breathing returned to normal.

“ You wish I would not go? ” Darcy felt stupid repeating her words, but he suddenly feared he had not heard her correctly.

“ I wish you to stay, Mr. Darcy. ”

His mind swirled with conflicting thoughts, and he was afraid if he opened his mouth, his confusion would shock her into leaving. It was the last thing he wanted. Pulling the letter from his pocket, he again offered it to her.

Elizabeth put her hand up, her palm facing him, and shook her head, “No.”

His confusion grew. Why would she not read it? Why?

Darcy had no clue he had asked the question aloud until Elizabeth offered her answer.

“ Sir, neither of our behaviours last night was a credit to our upbringing. In the clear light of day, I see not only our faults, but our commonalities."
B00ORBNER40,B00ORBNER4,"He never failed in his duties.

Never.

But this damned Honeywell business was cutting up his peace.

Montford couldn’t explain why it had unsettled him so much, or why he was presently sitting behind his desk in the library, staring vacantly into the fireplace at ten o’clock at night. Yet the truth of the matter was that, loath as he was to admit it, he had felt poised on the edge of a precipice ever since he had formally asked for Lady Araminta’s hand, and the Honeywell business had given him the final push.

Montford did not believe he had made a mistake regarding his choice of duchess. He had carefully selected Araminta out of all of the eligible women in the kingdom. No one had her impeccable bloodlines, her poise, or her tidiness. She seemed intelligent enough, so he did not have to worry about his offspring being lack-witted. And she did not natter on as most females did, and had no bad habits, as far as he knew, that would annoy him overmuch. And even if she did, he owned seventeen residences, all of them big enough so that he never even had to see his wife if he so chose."
B00ORBNER41,B00ORBNER4,"M.

Astrid’s lips curled at the edges in a sly grin, and one eyebrow lifted in an expression that an onlooker would have likely termed devilish.

“ What indeed, you bloody piker? ” she murmured, crumpling the letter in her fist and heading for the nearest available open flame. “ You’ll have to send someone worthy next time around. Not that it would do you any good. We aren’t going anywhere. ”

Though inside she was not nearly so sanguine. Trouble was coming to Rylestone Hall. It was only a matter of time. But one thing she knew for certain: Rylestone belonged to the Honeywells, not Montford, no matter what any trifling contract said.

Chapter Two

Back in London . . .

MONTFORD WAS supposed to have gone somewhere that evening. A ball, he believed it was, at the Duke of Belmont’s. He had, at his last tedious morning call to Araminta, promised to lead his fiancée out for the first waltz. The prospect had filled neither Araminta nor Montford with anything resembling anticipation. He was merely doing his duty, and so was Araminta, with her usual glacial poise. But now, it seemed, he would fail in that duty this particular night. Which was quite horrifying."
B01MU4CQSC0,B01MU4CQSC,"A handsome older gentleman with wavy blond hair and a California bronze smiled across a display of the latest in leather footwear. “ It is you. I’d know that profile anywhere. One part Greta Garbo, two parts Irene Dunne, with a splash of Rita Hayworth and a twist of Carole Landis. ”

“ You make me sound like a cocktail. ”

“ One sip is all it takes to be knocked flat.” He placed his hands over his heart in mock surprise as he took a few staggering steps backward.

Though the soldier’s attention was seemingly directed at a map of the Cameron Highlands and the pleasures to be found there, Lucy would swear he was listening to every word spoken.

“I’m surprised to see you here, Mr. Oliver. I thought you’d be at lunch with Lady Amelia. I know she mentioned it when I saw her this morning. ”

Mason Oliver was reputed to be an influential producer from Hollywood. Since his arrival in Singapore, he had become a fixture at the big airy house on Orchard Road, his constant presence at Amelia’s side accepted by everyone—Fortescue included. Lucy’s

stepfather probably found himself relieved at his wife’s preoccupation. It meant he could conduct his own affairs with greater ease."
B01MU4CQSC1,B01MU4CQSC,"In the store’s bleak overhead lights, his jungle tan was sallow, dark sooty circles trapped beneath his pale eyes, skin stretched tight over the angled bones of his face. His blond hair had been smoothed down with oil, though the island’s eternal humidity had already caused small curls at the nape of his neck and just behind his ears. He stared at her, and she found herself coloring under his gaze.

“ Please, Lucy. I can do nothing for you but this one small thing. ” Hai put a hand on her sleeve.

Lucy stepped subtly from under his touch as the clerk headed in their direction. He cast a sidelong glance at Hai, who wandered

away to browse among the ties. “Is there something I can help you with? ”

“ I’d like to see the gold one there with the grommeted band,” Lucy replied.

“ Of course. ”

She pretended to ooh and ahh over the watch while her mind churned with questions. “ I’ll take it. Put it on Reginald Fortescue’s account. ”

He took the watch and headed toward the register while Lucy meandered toward Yoon Hai, feigning delight in a blue silk tie with yellow dots. “Don’t worry about me. I’m like a cat. I always land on my feet,” she whispered under her breath.

“Miss Stanhope? Is that you? ”"
B00TBKYK9C0,B00TBKYK9C,"Geysers of soda erupted from the previous site of the soft-drink dispenser. Then, with a shriek of rending wood, the roof caved in.

Bonnie and the other keepers kept after the herd, desperately yelling commands at them as though they were Labrador retrievers. “Stop! Stay! Bad elephants! Bad elephants! ”

My father and Athmani both looked extremely concerned—although they weren’t watching the elephants. In fact, neither seemed to be aware the restaurant had collapsed. They were staring off in the opposite direction, the way the rifle shot had come from. Both started running that way.

“ Wait! ” I called, chasing after them. “ Shouldn’t we help with the elephants? ”

“Bonnie will get them under control,” Dad told me. “ Right now I’m more worried about whoever fired that shot. ”

“ You don’t think it was only a hunter? ”

“ No,” Dad said. “Whoever fired that gun was too close to FunJungle. I don’t think they were going after deer or rabbits. ”

“ You mean . . . ? ” I began.

“ Yes. ” Dad looked back at me, and I could see the worry in his eyes. “ I think someone just tried to kill one of our animals. ”

THE RHINO"
B00TBKYK9C1,B00TBKYK9C,"—and when you’re fleeing for your life, every last bit of weight you can leave behind helps. Within seconds, the ground was a minefield of elephant poo, with an ocean of pee around it. Understandably, the keepers were in no hurry to run through it.

Ahead of them, the panicked elephants stampeded onward—even though the Gorilla Grill, one of the most popular restaurants at FunJungle, sat right in their way. In the wild, there’s not much that elephants can’t plow through, except for the occasional baobab tree, so when they’re on the run, they tend to go in a straight line, flattening anything in their path.

The restaurant was no match for them. The front of it was floor-to-ceiling windows. The herd smashed right through them, shattering the glass and splintering the support beams, then stormed through the dining area, crushing tables and chairs as though they were made of paper. They crashed through the far wall, trampled the outdoor furniture, and raced off toward Monkey Mountain.

I picked myself up off the ground and surveyed the wreckage. The restaurant was totaled. The service counter had been pounded into toothpicks. The grills had been upended and jets of flame flared from where the gas lines had snapped."
B0081KYZPW0,B0081KYZPW,"Dear Mrs. Rode,” said Shane Hecht in that voice of abstract vagueness which she reserved for her most venomous pronouncements: “ So sweet…and such simple taste, don’t you think? I mean, whoever would have dreamed of putting those china ducks on the wall? Big ones at the front and little ones at the back. Charming, don’t you think? Like one of those teashops. I wonder where she bought them. I must ask her. I’m told her father lives near Bournemouth. It must be so lonely for him, don’t you think? Such a vulgar place; no one to talk to. ”

Fielding sat back and surveyed his own table. The silver was good. The best in Carne, he had heard it said, and he was inclined to agree. This Half he had nothing but black candles. It was the sort of thing people remembered when you’d gone: “ Dear old Terence—marvellous host. He dined every member of the staff during his last Half, you know, wives too. Black candles, rather touching. It broke his heart giving up his house. ” But he must annoy Charles Hecht. Shane would like that. Shane would egg him on because she hated Charles, because within her great ugly body she was as cunning as a snake."
B0081KYZPW1,B0081KYZPW,"We don’t do that kind of thing now, do we? I’ve got nothing against Mr. Iredale as commandant, nothing at all. What was his regiment, Terence, do you know? I’m sure he does it very nicely, whatever they do now in the Corps—he gets on so well with the boys, doesn’t he? His wife’s such a nice person … I wonder why they can never keep their servants. I hear Mr. Rode will be helping out with the Corps next Half. ”

“ Poor little Rode,” said Fielding slowly; “running about like a puppy, trying to earn his biscuits. He tries so hard; have you seen him cheering at school matches? He’d never seen a game of rugger before he came here, you know. They don’t play rugger at grammar schools— it’s all soccer. Do you remember when he first came, Charles? It was fascinating. He lay very low at first, drinking us in: the games, the vocabulary, the manners. Then, one day it was as if he had been given the power of speech, and he spoke in our language. It was amazing, like plastic surgery. It was Felix D’Arcy ’s work of course— I’ve never seen anything quite like it before. ”

“"
B07B2LFVJF0,B07B2LFVJF,"William excused himself and let his daughters lead the way around the stalls. He watched as they picked up a couple of dolls, and waited for them to continue walking before he moved in to buy them. Much to his surprise, a smile settled on his face as he watched, but as they approached a stand selling roasted chestnuts, he froze. Mr Wetherby and Aunt Sarah-Ann were heading straight for him. For a moment he considered changing direction, but before he moved they were upon him.

“ Good afternoon, William,” his aunt said. “Eleanor said she was going to bring you; I’m glad you could make it. ”

“ I came for the girls … ” He watched the heads of his daughters as they chattered together beside a stall.

“ How’s that business of yours going? ” Mr Wetherby asked.

“Fine. ” William spoke with as much confidence as he could muster.

“ I met your new partner, Mr Ball, last week. He says things appear promising. You have a full order book at any rate. ”

William glared at Mr Wetherby. “ That happens to be private business between me and Mr Ball. He had no right to show you the books. ”"
B07B2LFVJF1,B07B2LFVJF,"”

William glanced from Florence to Margaret, who clung to Eleanor’s other arm. “ Yes, she does,” William said. “ Mother wanted you all to go to school and we don’t want to disappoint her. ”

Florence squeezed her eyes closed as she held on to Eleanor more tightly.

“ I’ll only be away for one more year,” Eleanor said. “ Then I’ll be home for good. It will be something to look forward to. ”

The church hall wasn’t big and by the time they arrived people were jostling for space. Eleanor headed straight for Elizabeth and Olivia’s stall.

“ We made it,” Eleanor said, a grin spread across her face. “ And we brought Father. ”

William smiled. “ It was more than my life was worth to say no to my daughters. ”

“ Well, I’m glad you’re here, ” Olivia said. “ I had no success with William Junior. ”

“ It’s not the sort of thing my brother would enjoy. ”

“ Can we go and find some toys? ” Florence said. “ If we see something we like, will Father Christmas bring it for us? ”

“ You’ll have to wait and see. ”"
B001E0V1120,B001E0V112,"I swear the man understands more about running our lands than I do. I’m only a four-day ride away. You have a fine mind, son, and that’s why you have to stay. This city is a vipers’ nest. There are those who would destroy us. Your mother has seen hints of that, and it’s been part of her troubles. I’m gambling with you, Logan. I wish I didn’t have to, but you’re the only piece I have left to play. Surprise them. Be smarter, better, braver, and faster than anyone expects. It’s not a fair burden for me to put on you, but I must. I’m counting on you. House Gyre is counting on you. All our retainers and vassals are counting on you, and maybe even the kingdom itself. ”

Duke Gyre swung up onto his huge white destrier. “ I love you, son. But don’t let me down. ”

The darkness was as close and cold as the dead’s embrace. Azoth squatted against the alley wall, hoping the night wind covered the sound of thunder in his heart. The fifth big who’d joined him had stolen a shiv from Rat’s weapons cache, and Azoth clutched the thin metal so tightly his hand hurt."

“That jackal will hurl you against my family , you know that. Destroy you, destroy them— he wins no matter what. ”

“ This is your family, Catrinna. And I’ve made my decision. ” Duke Gyre’s voice carried with a whip crack of command, an edge that made Logan want to shrink and not be noticed.

“ Which of your harlots are you taking with you? ”

“ I’m not taking any of the maidservants, Catrinna, though some of them will be hard to replace. I’m leaving them here out of respect for your—”

“ How stupid do you think I am? You’ll just find sluts there. ”

“Catrinna. Go inside. Now! ”

She obeyed and Duke Gyre watched her go. He spoke without turning toward Logan. “ Your mother… there are things I’ll share with you when you’re older. For now, I expect you to honor her, but you will be Lord Gyre while I’m gone. ”

Logan’s eyes went wide.

His father clapped him on the shoulder. “ That doesn’t mean you get to skip your lessons. Wendel will teach you everything you need to know."

And of course, now that he says it, I remember that frontpage headline.

“ I know they did,” I reply haughtily. “ I read it in the FT. ” And before he can say anything else, I walk off, to talk to Elly.

As the press conference is about to start, Elly and I sidle toward the back and grab two seats together. We’re in one of the bigger conference rooms and there must be about a hundred chairs arranged in rows, facing a podium and a large screen. I open my notebook, write “Brandon Communications ” at the top of the page, and start doodling swirly flowers down the side. Beside me, Elly’s dialing her telephone horoscope on her mobile phone.

I take a sip of champagne, lean back, and prepare to relax. There’s no point listening at press conferences. The information’s always in the press pack, and you can work out what they were talking about later. In fact, I’m wondering whether anyone would notice if I took out a pot of Hard Candy and did my nails, when suddenly the awful Alicia ducks her head down to mine."

“ I … I certainly saw it coming, ” I say, and I’m pretty sure I sound convincing.

“ And now this rumor about Scottish Prime and Flagstaff Life going the same way! ” She looks at me intently. “ Do you think that’s really on the cards? ”

“ It’s … it’s difficult to say,” I reply, and take a gulp of champagne. What rumor? Why can’t she leave me alone?

Then I make the mistake of glancing up at Luke Brandon. He’s staring at me, his mouth twitching slightly. Oh shit. He knows I don’t have a clue, doesn’t he?

“Alicia,” he says abruptly, “that’s Maggie Stevens coming in. Could you—”

“Absolutely,” she says, trained like a racehorse, and starts to move smoothly toward the door.

“ And Alicia— ” adds Luke, and she quickly turns back. “ I want to know exactly who fucked up on those figures. ”

“ Yes,” gulps Alicia, and walks off.

God he’s scary. And now we’re on our own. I think I might quickly run away.

“ Well,” I say brightly. “ I must just go and …”

But Luke Brandon is leaning toward me."
B0057AMO2A0,B0057AMO2A,"The yard night shift was populated by the sick, the lame, and the lazy—they topped the gangway in search of a sleeping place, never to be seen again except as man-hours on the yard invoice. It had been dicey at first when the American Dugan was around. He’d had an unfortunate tendency to show up at all hours, checking on progress. But with the yard period almost over and the little Italian in charge, things were more predictable on the night watch.

Medina entered the deckhouse, climbed the stairs to the bridge deck, then began a slow deck-by-deck descent, walking each passageway to ensure everyone was ashore. He continued into the engine room, where he found yard workers dozing in scattered corners, and then walked the main deck from bow to stern, finding no one. Satisfied, he went to his cabin and locked the door behind him before rooting in his wardrobe locker.

He placed two items on his bed, and then sat in his desk chair and looked at them, still amazed that he’d been expected to strike a mighty blow with such meager weapons. An ancient Makarov pistol with a single clip and a martyr’s vest, now disassembled, were his entire arsenal. His contact had given him the things, said “Allah will guide you,” and left, leaving Medina uncertain and trembling at the prospect of failure."
B0057AMO2A1,B0057AMO2A,"Come along, Ms. Walsh,” Mrs. Coutts said, moving into the hallway as Anna hurried after.

Dugan watched them disappear and wondered how to patch things up with Mrs. Coutts.

* **

Braun stood in his doorway and watched Anna’s retreating backside. Bloody well perfect. And more than enough to distract Dugan. And when Dugan was out of the way, he’d double the slut’s salary if she was accommodating. It was only Kairouz’s money, after all.

Medina leaned on the rail, mentally hurrying his shipmates down the steep gangway in their “goin’ ashore” clothes. The ship floated at a wet berth now, the main deck high above the dock, her tanks mostly empty. The second mate smiled and waved up at Medina, then said something to the man beside him, who shook his head and laughed, undoubtedly at a joke at Medina’s expense. Let them laugh, thought Medina; the last laugh would be his.

He’d volunteered for night watches, citing his desire to explore Singapore by day. He spent those days in internet cafés and, as plans evolved, the electronics shops of Sim Lim Tower, returning to nap each afternoon in preparation for evenings alone on board. Or almost alone."
B001POX6VK0,B001POX6VK,"She leaned forward to pinch his chin, her eyes full of loving mockery. ‘You can’t bamboozle me, you rogue! You are a here-and-thereian, you know, exactly as I am persuaded Papa told you! I wish you might form a tendre for some very nice girl, and settle down with her! Never mind! I don’t mean to tease you!’

She withdrew her hand, but he caught it, and held it, saying, with a searching look: ‘Do you, Mama? Did you, perhaps, wish me to offer for Hetta, nine years ago? Would you have liked her to have been your daughter-in-law?’

‘ What a very odd notion you have of me, my love! I hope I am not such a pea-goose as to have wished you to marry any girl for whom you had formed no lasting passion! To be sure, I have a great regard for Hetta, but I daresay you would not have suited. In any event, that has been past history for years, and nothing is such a sad bore as to be recalling it! I promise you, I shall welcome the bride you do choose at last with as much pleasure as I shall attend Hetta’s wedding to the man of her choice.’"
B001POX6VK1,B001POX6VK,"According to Lady Draycott, he is an excellent person, of the first respectability, a thousand agreeable talents, and most distinguished manners. I haven’t met him myself, but I do hope something may come of it, for I have the greatest regard for Henrietta, and have always wished to see her comfortably established. And, if Lady Draycott is to be believed, this Mr – Mr Nethersole – no, not Nethersole, but some name like that – seems to be just the man for her.’

‘ He sounds to me like a dashed dull dog!’ said the Viscount.

‘Yes, but persons of uniform virtues always do sound dull, Ashley. It seems to me such an odd circumstance! However, we must remember that Lady Draycott is not wholly to be relied on, and I daresay she has exaggerated. She thinks everyone she likes a pattern-saint, and everyone she doesn’t like a rascal.’ Her eyes twinkled. ‘ Well, she says you are a man of character, and very well conducted!’

‘Much obliged to her!’ said the Viscount. ‘ To think she should judge me so well!’

She laughed. ‘Yes, indeed! It is a striking example of the advantage of having engaging manners. What a sad reflection it is that to have powers of captivation should be of much more practical use than worthiness!’"
B0011UCPM40,B0011UCPM4,"He clenched the heavy suitcase in his right hand and held the left out from his side as the wiry Tunisian, eyes red, features grim, and teeth bared, patted him down.

Six men other than Shaw stood in the small upstairs room. It was a typical flat situated on a minor canal. High up, it was narrow as a snake hole, with knotted rope pulls in lieu of stair rails to enable the climber to make the near-vertical assault. One could easily become winded merely going from the first to the second floor of an Amsterdam canal residence.

The reason was historical, Shaw had learned. Centuries ago all these homes had been merchants’ places of business. And back when they’d been constructed the only carpenters available were ship’s carpenters. These men, logically, had decided that what was good for a boat was good for a house and had built the stairs nearly straight up as was the practice on space-challenged ships. That’s also why most such homes had a steel beam like a ship’s prow jutting out from the top floor. They once had been used to haul up goods for sale and now were employed to hoist in furniture because there was no way in hell you’d get even a modest-sized couch up the stairs."
B0011UCPM41,B0011UCPM4,"You’re sure you don’t want me? ” Her tone of disbelief was as clearly etched as the look of incredulity on her face.

He hid his bemusement. She must be really new because her vanity was largely intact. The older whores would surely jump at the chance for full pay that included no humping.

“ Absolutely sure. ”

She slid her thong back up. “Pity. ”

“ Yes, pity,” he said. Actually, if things went according to plan, in two days hence he’d be in Dublin with the only woman he’d ever really loved. And also the reason why he had to get out. Now.

Still, even Shaw had to acknowledge, it was a big if. In his line of work, tomorrow was just another day to die.

CHAPTER 6

THERE IS ALWAYS A DAMN Tunisian, Moroccan, or Egyptian involved. Always. Shaw said this to himself. One slip with these gents and they’d rip your gonads off and force-feed them to you and say that Allah had told them to do it if they bothered to give you a reason at all. See you in paradise, infidel. Serve me well for eternity, filthy pig. He knew the speeches by heart."
B00GNK1Y060,B00GNK1Y06,"I looked down at Elsie’s black curls and decided it was probably something minor. After all, Mrs. Bunn considered failing to put a napkin on your lap at snack time to be a major lapse of decorum.

“We need to talk, Mrs. Peterson. ”

My mind cast about for a redeeming topic, something that would reinforce my commitment to Green Meadows Day School and get me out of the office. Should I offer to trim the hedges? Scrub the floors with a toothbrush later in the week? Then I remembered the newsletter. “ I’d love to talk about it— I’ll call you; maybe we can set something up for next Monday—but I’m on my way to upload the pictures from the class picnic. I need to have them ready for the school newsletter tomorrow. ”

Her gaze slackened a bit, and I took the opportunity to whisk the kids through the door. “ Thanks so much, Mrs. Bunn. See you tomorrow! ”

I pulled into our cracked driveway ten minutes later and made a mental note to ask Blake to cut the grass. Our neighbors’ lawns looked like golf course greens; ours resembled something you’d see on a National Geographic special on the wilds of the Serengeti."
B00GNK1Y061,B00GNK1Y06,"You’re late. ”

I put on my best concerned-parent look. “ I’m so sorry. It won’t happen again. ”

She handed me the missive of the day—there were always missives of the day at Green Meadows Day School—with all the pomp and circumstance of the pope delivering the latest bull. Then her steely eyes focused on Nick, whose chubby toddler body was wrapped around my leg. “ Nick had another accident. There were no spare clothes in his cubby, so we had to put him in Elsie’s. ” That explained the skirt.

“ Well, I’ve always tried to have a gender-neutral household. ”

She harrumphed, sending a jiggle through her jowls. “ I’d like to have a meeting with you, Mrs. Peterson, to discuss some issues regarding parental involvement at the school and proper nutrition for the children. There’s also a behavior issue I’d like to address . . . ” She cocked a bushy eyebrow at Elsie.

I’d been through the nutrition lecture before and was more than familiar with the litany of my sins: using Jif peanut butter instead of the natural and unsweetened variety, white bread instead of whole wheat . . .

But a behavior issue?"
B016DHOBDK0,B016DHOBDK,"Anna’s fingers wanted to trace their way over every detail and run over every room on that map in front of her eyes. Her mind wanted to imagine the entire place—set it out. A palace? Who lived there now? What must her grandfather’s childhood have been like? It was what she had always wanted to know, but she needed to talk to him properly. She didn’t want these vague hints. Asking her to go and get something? What was that? Why now?

“We’ll have to talk about this later,” she said, but she said it with kindness. She simply had to return to work. Frustration at this blended with an urgent desire to know everything.

When Max answered, he sounded firm. “ I know you’re interested in going, Anna. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned in this life, it’s that you should trust your instincts. Believe me, I’ve learned that the hard way. And you shouldn’t push things —opportunities —away. Not when every bone in your body tells you that you want to do them. Don’t let fear stop you from being happy. ”

Anna stared at him again. What on earth was that about? This was not her Max! All she could do was shake her head."
B016DHOBDK1,B016DHOBDK,"There’s a strong chance it will still be there,” he said, finally.

“ Oh, come on, Anna! ” Cass stood up. “ You can’t just not go! ”

“I can’t just run off to Berlin! ” She turned to her grandfather. “ And I don’t like leaving you alone. What gave you this mad idea anyway? The abandoned apartment in Paris? Because that is clearly a freakish situation. You can’t expect your . . . stuff . . . to be sitting there too, untouched after all these years. ”

Max leaned his forearms on the table.

Anna sighed. “ I have questions. So many questions, Grandfather. First, what is it that you want me to retrieve? Second, couldn’t we just write to the owners and ask them to send whatever it is you want back? Surely we could find a simpler way to do this. And third, we need to talk about this. Please. ”

“You could go away for months and the business would be fine,” Cass said. “I can run everything for both of us. It runs like a Swiss train. ”

“A conspiracy then. ”

“ No, it’s not. ” Cass and Max spoke at once."
B000SEI5CI0,B000SEI5CI,"I expected that I would return to the two closed doors on the right side of the hall, between the master bedroom and Danny’s room, and that I would discover what lay behind them. As before, however, I wasn’t drawn to them.

On the left side were three other closed doors. None of those had an attraction for me, either.

In addition to the ability to see ghosts, a gift I’d happily trade for piano artistry or a talent for flower arranging, I’ve been given what I call psychic magnetism.

When someone isn’t where I expect to find him, I can go for a walk or ride my bicycle, or cruise in a car, keeping his name or face in my mind, turning randomly from one street to another; and sometimes in minutes, sometimes in an hour, I encounter the one I’m seeking. It’s like setting a pair of those Scottie-dog magnets on a table and watching them slide inexorably toward each other.

The key word is sometimes.

On occasion, my psychic magnetism functions like the finest Cartier watch. At other times, it’s like an egg timer bought at a cheap discount store’s going-out-of-business sale; you set it for poached, and it gives you hard-boiled."

“ The writer? I thought he was dead, sir. ”

“About as dead as Dickens. Tell me you’re just lonesome, son, and not in trouble again. ”

“ I didn’t ask for trouble, sir. But you better come to Dr. Jessup’s house. ”

“ I’m hoping it’s a simple burglary. ”

“Murder,” I said. “Wilbur Jessup on the floor of his bedroom. It’s a bad one. ”

“ Where’s Danny? ”

“ I’m thinking kidnapped. ”

“ Simon,” he said.

Simon Makepeace— Carol’s first husband, Danny’s father—had been released from prison four months ago, after serving sixteen years for manslaughter.

“ Better come with some force,” I said. “And quiet. ”

“Someone still there? ”

“ I get the feeling. ”

“You hold back, Odd. ”

“ You know I can’t. ”

“ I don’t understand your compulsion. ”

“ Neither do I, sir. ”

I pressed END and pocketed the cell phone.

ASSUMING THAT DANNY MUST BE STILL NEARBY and under duress, and that he was most likely on the ground floor , I headed toward the front stairs. Before I began to descend, I found myself turning and retracing the route that I’d just followed."
B0763DR8CR0,B0763DR8CR,"Remember I said it had been too long since we'd chatted? I meant that. Seeing you, but not as your usual self yesterday, stayed on my mind. It's true that I called because you were on my mind and when I didn't get you last night or this morning …when I didn't even get a reply to my messages, I was worried.""

Maia stopped and breathed for a moment, needing to calm herself. The after-effects of the sudden, shocking waking, lingered. “ I'm glad all's well with Brendan and the gallery, and everyone else. Now tell me, what's on your mind?""

""Oh, Maia. It's nothing. I don't know why it's troubling me.""

""Please just say it.""

""It's Frannie.""

""Frannie?""

Juli shook her head. "" Well, not so much Frannie as... Frances Cooke. "" She whispered half-under her breath. "" Frances Ann Cooke.""

""Your mother.""

This time the shrug was hugely exaggerated, almost like someone trying to rid themselves of a recurring pain in the neck.

""Our mother. Yes. Frannie wants to go find her grave. ""

""Okay."" Maia kept her tone non-committal.

""Okay, yes, she can do as she wants. The problem is she wants me to go with her."""
B0763DR8CR1,B0763DR8CR,"She put the tea, lemon and crackers on the table. She sat and faced Juli.

""Tell me.""

""Tell you what?""

""Don't be evasive.""

""I'm not."" Juli looked away, staring at the floor and then the walls.

Maia followed her eyes. There were stains on the wall beneath the window sill. Moisture stains. Old, but not active. Someone should've wiped those off.

Suddenly, she was angry. She was being forced to see things as they were. She wanted to see the Bridle Cove she enjoyed, see it as it existed in her head despite its imperfections.

""Look,"" Maia said, ""I know it's not new. It's old and reliable. It's peaceful. I don't need fancy.""

""What?""

The look in Juli's eyes was distant, almost haunted. It chilled Maia. She touched Juli's hand. Her friend seemed to snap out of it. Her chin lifted. She found a small smile to share.

""I'm sorry,"" Juli said again.

""No more apologies. Let's get past the unannounced visit. I should be glad someone cared enough to track me down, except I haven't been gone all that long, nor ignored my phone all that long, so I'm guessing that's just an excuse?""

Juli sighed and clasped her hands. """

“ How’s the family? ”

“ If you’d visit once in a while, you wouldn’t have to ask. ”

“ You know how it is. ”

“ Yeah, I know. ”

Nathan’s tone changed. “ From one to ten, what’s the urgency of tonight’s meeting with Ortega? ”

“Ten. ”

They drove south on I-5, enjoying a comfortable silence. After a few miles, Harv merged east onto I-8.

“ You get a chance to look at the financials I sent last week? ”

Nathan grunted.

“Our net worth went up another eight hundred grand this quarter. ”

“ Just paper. ”

“I know money bores you, but honestly. You own a helicopter, for cryin’ out loud, and your home in La Jolla is to kill for. ” Harvey shook his head. “ If you ever get truly bored with your share of our company, you can always sell it to me. ”

“Don’t worry, it’s yours for free when I kick the bucket. ”

“ I wish you wouldn’t talk that way. My world is much more interesting with you in it. ”

“ So”—Nathan ’s tone signaled a change of subject—“you and Ortega go pretty far back. ”"

CHAPTER 2

Nathan’s Clairemont home was similar to every other on the block, meticulously landscaped with a pastel stucco exterior and tile roof. What set Nathan’s apart was its state-of-the-art security system. Some would call it overkill, but Nathan called it an indulgence. He and Harvey Fontana owned a company that installed such systems. Why shouldn’t he own the best?

A metallic-blue Mercedes pulled into Nathan’s driveway and its driver climbed out. Harvey, the same age as Nathan, stood four inches shorter. His light hazel eyes were an extreme contrast to his tanned Latino complexion. Gray hair was definitely winning the battle. Nathan thought Harv had the classic look of a politician, but wouldn’t hold that against him.

“ You know I’m here,” Harv muttered. He sounded like James Earl Jones with a Spanish accent. “ The least you could do is meet me outside. ”

“ I am outside,” Nathan said.

Harv whipped around. “ Damn it, Nate. I hate it when you do that. ”

“ Why do you drive that big thing? ”

“ I’m a big man, I need a big ride. What’s it to you? ”

“ You’re an average-sized man... Everywhere. ”

“ It’s good to see you too, Nate."
B01MXDDQKP0,B01MXDDQKP,"Craig and I met late, and so the time we have had together was almost immediately shared with the children, which is why we have to guard our relationship so preciously. It can be such a struggle to try and find each other between sleepless nights and children’s tantrums. So far at least, I think we are managing.

But things are going to become more difficult.

My mother has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Too late. As is all too frequently the case. When the consultant told her last week, I was there, holding her hand, looking into my father’s eyes.

The kettle boils and I pour water on top of the freshly ground coffee beans waiting in the cafetière. I reach for the Eton mess I messed up earlier, and return to the party – followed by the fear of suffering and loneliness. Followed by my father’s eyes.

Carly’s cheeks are slightly red and the tip of her nose is glowing.

‘ Craig tells me you have to go on hospital duty next week without the kids. Can I be of any help?’ she asks as I serve her a generous portion of dessert. Perhaps a bit more food will sober her up."
B01MXDDQKP1,B01MXDDQKP,"Laughing too loud at Craig’s blokey jokes, and every time she does so Rob looks embarrassed. Rob, clean-cut and sensible in his stonewashed jeans and carefully ironed shirt. Even Craig looks surprised at the depth of Carly’s laughter.

I excuse myself and leave the room, walking back to our small galley kitchen to fetch dessert and put the kettle on for coffee. As I wait for it to boil, I look around at the culinary debris and sit on the low windowsill looking at the mess. Craig was right, entertaining like this is too much in the week. And he has to be up at five o’clock in the morning to start his shift at the fire station. He was recently promoted to leading fireman. I am so pleased for him. Craig, the only man I have ever loved. Unlike Carly, I haven’t had much experience with men. Craig is the only man I have slept with. I know that seems strange in this day and age of openness and overt sexuality, but it’s because of my religious convictions. My relationship with God. A relationship I am proud of. I don’t feel constrained or repressed because of it. God opens my life out."
B00MOFRCSW0,B00MOFRCSW,"I’ve been working on an aging spell. I haven’t worked out all of the finer details, but what I’ve got so far might serve our purposes. ”

“ How’s that? ” asked Julian.

“ If I can magically age the horse, its body will go through the processes you require within the time frame of the Mount spell. ”

“ Good enough for me, Prof. Have at it. ”

Professor Goosewaddle placed a hand on the horse’s front leg. “Furfuryl Furfurate. ”

The horse’s eyes immediately began to glaze over. Its body withered, skin stretching around its bones. Its wound grew wider and festered rapidly. And then the horse blinked out of existence altogether.

“What the hell just happened? ” asked Julian.

“ Interesting,” said the professor, stroking his beard. “ It would appear that the horse starved to death. I’ll make a note of it. ”

“ What’s the point of an aging spell if it doesn’t account for nourishment? ”

“ I said it wasn’t perfected yet, ” said the professor. “Trial and error, lad. Trial and error. ”

“ Well shit,” said Julian. “ You killed another horse. Now what do we do? ”

Stacy made her move, bolting for the exit."
B00MOFRCSW1,B00MOFRCSW,"He held up the dented Diet Dr. Pepper can. “ You know they say this tastes just like regular Dr. Pepper, but that’s bullshit. This stuff tastes like ass. ” He pierced the root beer can with a tusk and sucked out the liquid.

“ Somebody better tell me what the fuck is going on before I really start to lose my shit! ” said Stacy.

“Miss Swanson,” said Julian. “ This is my friend Cooper. He’s the one that was poisoned. ” He gestured at Cooper’s foaming wound. “ We’ll be happy to answer all of your questions just as soon as we get him healed up. Now we’ve got a poisoned horse. What’s the next step? ”

Stacy stepped carefully over soda cans, broken glass, and syringes, inching her way toward the exit. “ Now you need to wait about ten weeks for the antibodies to build up in the horse’s blood. ”

“ We don’t have that kind of time! ” said Julian. “ The spell duration on that horse has less than two hours to go, and Cooper might have even less time than that. ”

“I may be able to help,” said Professor Goosewaddle. “"
B078FRXYDB0,B078FRXYDB,"Marc drew his cuffs and slammed his weight onto Adrian before the man could resist. “ I love that woman. ”

Now face down against the seat while Marc cuffed him, Adrian grunted. “ My affection is waning. ”

Kendle laughed.

“Stay with the ride. ” Marc included Adrian as well as Kevin as he left. The driver would remain in their vehicle the entire time, and they didn’t need anyone spotting Adrian yet.

As the pair exited the RV, Adrian slid his fingers into his pocket and retrieved the cuff key he’d begun keeping there after the last time Angela had surrendered him to the enemy. He curled it into his palm and regarded Kevin, who had missed it all for his maps. “ Are you okay? ”

Kevin tensed. “Surviving. ”

Hearing his ugly tone, Kevin forced himself to relax. “ I’m sorry about the baby. ”

“Me too. And Cynthia. ”

Kevin stared, no longer seeing roads and bridges. “ She told me she wasn’t going to make it out of the mountain and I blew her off. ”

Adrian’s own guilt rushed out of his mouth. “ She came to me, hoping I would claim her. I laughed. ”"
B078FRXYDB1,B078FRXYDB,"That’s why I thought you had it. ”

Kendle cleared her throat, holding up a sheet of paper. “ She wanted us to rest before we got here. Told me not to mention it until now. ”

Adrian snatched the paper from Kendle and began to read.

Marc snatched the paper from Adrian and handed it back to Kendle. “ She gave it to you. Read it. ”

Smirking, Kendle did.

“ The boss says we can use one of her plans or make our own. ”

“ What are hers? ” Marc demanded. “ Those will be the extreme.”

“A, is to use the refugees to overrun them and let those lost souls have the supplies. With B, we get to bring the supplies home. ”

“B,” Marc and Adrian declared at the same time.

Kendle kept reading. “ All it says is infiltration. There’s a kit, but I haven’t opened it. She says not to unless we choose plan B.”

“Open it now. ”

The mood in the RV lifted in bright pleasure as Marc caught Kendle’s thought as she opened the kit. He grinned at Adrian.

Adrian tensed. “ What? ”

Kendle held up the UN uniform.

Adrian groaned. “ Really? Again? ”"
B07BF2MVRG0,B07BF2MVRG,"Gretchen pounded on the door, threatening to break it off its hinges. “Merlino. Open this up and let me in there, right this second. ”

I couldn’t. I knew if I opened the door, I would get dragged out of the room and possibly arrested. Gretchen sounded pissed. I had to collect something from this beast before I left. That was it. A sample that Alayna could help me analyze.

“ Do you have scissors in here? ” I made the motion with my fingers for some reason.

“Not in these rooms. I don’t believe we do, ” said the doctor, who started rifling through the cabinets and drawers.

“Forget it. ” I pinched the werelion’s mane and tightened my grip several times to be sure I had a firm hold. Sorry buddy, but I need something to remember you by.

I yanked and pulled out less fur than I had expected and jammed it into my back pocket.

The doctor screamed, “You can’t do that. You can’t alter a specimen before it undergoes the autopsy. ”

“Relax. You already said he is dead. ” I pointed to his chest. His face. His blinking eyes.

Blinking eyes?

Damnit.

Chapter 15"
B07BF2MVRG1,B07BF2MVRG,"They prepared to take the body to the morgue when it suddenly changed into a human being. The coroner requested an autopsy on the man and when he got here, he changed into what you see right now. We didn’t know what to do. We panicked. Yes, even doctors panic. ”

“ So you shoved him in here until you could figure out what to do? ”

The doctor nodded, still staring at the clipboard. “ Precisely. Do you know what this thing is? ”

“I wish. We have a slight problem. It’s usually a human being that shifts into an animal and I am getting the suspicion that animals are taking over the bodies of humans, which is a much scarier prospect. ” I didn’t want to scare the man, but judging from his widening eyes, it wasn’t working.

Maybe that’s why they could shift without the assistance of the moons. The more I found out about this case, the more it spooked the hell out of me. I was permitted to call myself a wizard but I was also very early in my training. I had a bad feeling this case was going to require advanced knowledge that I simply hadn’t developed yet."
B004XFYNYM0,B004XFYNYM,"” she said, brutally aware that her youngest was the only family member who seemed to be where he was supposed to be, doing what he was supposed to do. “ How’d that Lit exam go? ”

“Not so good. ”

“ Oh? ” She settled back in her chair and propped her feet up on the railing. Compared to all the truly horrible things that had happened lately, one bad test score hardly seemed worth getting worked up about. “ Well, I’m sure if you study harder for the next one, you’ll be back on track. You just need to buckle down now. You’ve always been a great student. ”

“ No, Mom, it’s too late for that. ”

She drew a deep breath, less worried now about serenity than not exploding.

“ How can it be too late? You’ve got another month left and a final exam still to take. ” She fingered the stem of her wineglass and looked at it with real longing, but there was not even a fraction of a drop left.

“ I’ve got a fifty in that class. ” There was a brief pause. “ And a sixty-five in History. I may be able to pass, but my academic scholarship’s finished. ”"
B004XFYNYM1,B004XFYNYM,"In the kitchen, Madeline poured herself a glass of wine; she’d slashed their household budget as far as possible, and so it was a single glass of Two Buck Chuck from Trader Joe ’s that she carried out onto the deck instead of a Kendall Jackson. She sipped it sparingly while she stared out over the deck railing and up the rise of the heavily wooded backyard. The pine trees stirred slightly in the early evening breeze, and she breathed in the soft scent of the camellia bush that had begun to bloom on the side of the house. She searched the sky, hoping to find at least a smidgen of serenity, but the reality of their situation made that impossible.

Bill collectors had begun calling, and she could barely afford the store brands at the grocery store. She’d delivered the last of her lightly worn clothing to the Designer Consigner shop yesterday.

Inside the phone rang and a few moments later the back door opened. Kyra stepped out onto the deck in a spill of light. “ It’s Andrew, Mom. He wants to talk to you. ” She covered the handset as she handed it to Madeline.

Madeline took the phone from her daughter and finished the last swallow of wine before lifting the receiver to her ear. “ Hi, sweetie,"
B002YKOXDY0,B002YKOXDY,"Everyone got a nice long glimpse of thigh, but it didn’t really matter, I was about to do the thing that disturbed me the most since I stopped sacrificing poultry.

I held out my hand towards Gordon Bennington’s face. “Drink, Gordon, drink of my blood and speak to us. ”

Those round, rolling eyes stared at me, then his sunken nose caught the scent of blood, and he grabbed my hand with both of his, and lowered his mouth to the wound. His hands felt like cold wax with sticks inside. His mouth was almost lipless, so his teeth pressed close in my flesh as he sucked at my hand. His tongue whipped back and forth on the wound like something separate and alive in his mouth, feeding from me.

I took a deep, steadying breath, breathe in and out, in and out. I would not be sick. Nope. I would not embarrass myself in front of this many people.

When I thought he’d had enough, I said, “Gordon Bennington. ”

He didn’t react, but kept his mouth pressed to the wound, his hands clutching my wrist.

I tapped the top of his head gently with the side of the machete. “Mr. Bennington, people are waiting to talk to you. ”"
B002YKOXDY1,B002YKOXDY,"He wasn’t awful, I’d seen much worse, but his widow screamed, long and loud, and began to sob. There had been more than one reason I wanted Mrs. Bennington to stay home.

The nice blue suit hid the chest wound that had killed him. But you could still tell he was dead. It was the odd color of his skin. The way the flesh had begun to sink into the bones of his face. His eyes left too round, too large, too bare, so they rolled in their sockets barely contained by the waxy flesh. His blond hair was patchy and looked like it had grown. But that was illusion, caused by the shrinking of the meat of his body. Hair and fingernails do not grow after death, contrary to popular belief.

There was one more thing I had to do to help Gordon Bennington speak. Blood. The Odyssey speaks of blood sacrifice to get a dead seer ’s ghost to give Odysseus advice. It’s a very old truism that the dead crave blood. I walked across the now solid ground and knelt by his puzzled, wizened face. I couldn’t smooth my skirt down in back because one hand was full of machete and the other was bleeding."
B00NUIJXQ60,B00NUIJXQ6,"Grim instantly sent a burst of aura at his camera.

The bearded guy yanked the camera from in front of his face and looked to be swearing as he studied its controls. A young woman next to him conferred with him about the camera before looking back up and meeting my gaze.

“ We’ve got portable screens, ” Rielly said, snapping me back to the situation at hand.

Closing the portal wasn’t difficult, just draining, and it had already been a busy day. Nothing tried to come out and the small, two-foot diameter and perfect circular shape made the closure straightforward. I just had to expend a lot of aura to do it.

When I had finished, I was tired and extremely hungry. Tanya was drooping with exhaustion in the glare of the mid-October sun. It was still early afternoon, and she had in effect pulled an all-dayer.

A car waited for us, on the other side of the police tape, one of Deckert’s guys driving it.

“Take her back to rest. I need a restaurant like right now. You can send someone else to pick me up,” I told Mr. Deckert. He didn’t look happy and he started to argue."
B00NUIJXQ61,B00NUIJXQ6,"The ninth and last box showed the final robed male having his arms yanked out of their sockets from behind and for the first time, we got a good look at the naked demon woman’s profile.

“Brianna Duclair,” Tanya whispered.

“ I thought Duclair was killed in New Hampshire? ” Rielly asked.

“ So did we. She got yanked into an open Hellhole like this one. Looks like she came back… or something wearing her skin came back,” I answered.

“Holy shit. What do we do? ” he asked.

“ Circulate her photo with strict on pain of death instructions not to go near her. As you can see, she will eat your men,” Tanya answered.

“ So what do we do when we find her? ” he asked.

“ You get us, Commissioner... Chris and me. We will take care of her, or whatever she’s become,” my vampire replied.

“ What about this circle? ”

“ If we can get a screen around it, I’ll close it right now. Too many media and cameras out there watching,” I said, pointing back to the police lines a hundred yards away. A bearded man with a telephoto-lens-equipped camera was just taking a picture of us as I spoke."
B000W918D20,B000W918D2,"Brown eyes fixed wide on his, a spark of recognition deep behind the shock and pain. He seized the dying man’s hand in his, and chafed it, knowing the futility of the gesture. Gerald’s mouth worked, soundless. A bubble of red spittle swelled at the corner of his lips.

“Tell me. ” Grey bent urgently to the man’s ear, and felt the soft brush of hair against his mouth. “ Tell me who has done it — I will avenge you. I swear it. ”

He felt a slight spasm of the fingers in his, and squeezed back, hard, as though he might force some of his own strength into Gerald; enough for a word, a name.

The soft lips were blanched, the blood bubble growing. Gerald drew back the corners of his mouth, a fierce, tooth-baring rictus that burst the bubble and sent a spray of blood across Grey’s cheek. Then the lips drew in, pursing in what might have been the invitation to a kiss. Then he died, and the wide brown eyes went blank.

Quarry was shouting at the bearers, demanding information. More shouts echoed down the walls of the streets, the nearby alleys, news flying from the scene of murder like bats out of hell."
B000W918D21,B000W918D2,"Then the crowd fell back, with a massed cry of horror, and his view was obscured by a throng of heaving backs.

He fought his way through the screaming mob without compunction, striking ruthlessly with his sword hilt to clear the way.

Gerald was lying in the arms of one of his bearers, hair fallen forward, hiding his face. The young man’s knees were drawn up in agony, balled fists pressed hard against the growing stain on his waistcoat.

Quarry was there; he brandished his sword at the crowd, bellowing threats to keep them back, then glared wildly round for a foe to skewer.

“ Who? ” he shouted at the bearers, face congested with fury. “ Who’s done this? ”

The circle of white faces turned in helpless question, one to another, but found no focus; the foe had fled, and his bearers with him.

Grey knelt in the gutter, careless of filth, and smoothed back the ruddy hair with hands gone stiff and cold. The hot stink of blood was thick in the air, and the fecal smell of pierced intestine. Grey had seen battlefields enough to know the truth even before he saw the glazing eyes, the pallid face. He felt a deep, sharp stab at the sight, as though his own guts were pierced, as well."
B006X2AZHC0,B006X2AZHC,"He had a cross of metal set with stones

And, in a glass, a rubble of pigs’ bones.

And with these relics, any time he found

Some poor up-country parson to astound,

In one short day, in money down, he drew

More than the parson in a month or two,

And by his flatteries and prevarication

Made monkeys of the priest and congregation.

But still to do him justice first and last

In church he was a noble ecclesiast.

How well he read a lesson or told a story!

But best of all he sang an Offertory,

For well he knew that when that song was sung

He’d have to preach and tune his honey-tongue

And (well he could) win silver from the crowd.

That’s why he sang so merrily and loud.

Now I have told you shortly, in a clause,

The rank, the array, the number and the cause

Of our assembly in this company

In Southwark, at that high-class hostelry

Known as The Tabard, close beside The Bell.

And now the time has come for me to tell

How we behaved that evening; I’ll begin

After we had alighted at the Inn,

Then I’ll report our journey, stage by stage,

All the remainder of our pilgrimage."
B006X2AZHC1,B006X2AZHC,"No trumpet ever sounded half so strong.

This Pardoner had hair as yellow as wax,

Hanging down smoothly like a hank of flax.

In driblets fell his locks behind his head

Down to his shoulders which they overspread;

Thinly they fell, like rat-tails, one by one.

He wore no hood upon his head, for fun;

The hood inside his wallet had been stowed,

He aimed at riding in the latest mode;

But for a little cap his head was bare

And he had bulging eye-balls, like a hare.

He’d sewed a holy relic on his cap;

His wallet lay before him on his lap,

Brimful of pardons come from Rome, all hot.

He had the same small voice a goat has got.

His chin no beard had harboured, nor would harbour,

Smoother than ever chin was left by barber.

I judge he was a gelding, or a mare.

As to his trade, from Berwick down to Ware

There was no pardoner of equal grace,

For in his trunk he had a pillow-case

Which he asserted was Our Lady’s veil.

He said he had a gobbet of the sail

Saint Peter had the time when he made bold

To walk the waves, till Jesu Christ took hold."
B000OT8GCG0,B000OT8GCG,"ROGER SEAGRAVES LOOKED across the conference table at the mouse of a man and his pitiful comb-over consisting of a dozen strands of greasy black hair that vainly attempted to cover a wide, flaky scalp. The man was skinny in the shoulders and legs and fat in the belly and butt. Though still in his forties, he probably would’ve been hard-pressed to jog more than twenty yards without collapsing. Lifting a grocery bag would no doubt have taxed the limits of his upper body strength. He could be a poster boy for the physical degradation of the entire male race in the twenty-first century, Seagraves thought. It irked him because physical fitness had always played paramount importance in his life.

He ran five miles every day, finishing before the sun was fully up. He could still do one-handed push-ups and bench-press twice his own weight. He could hold his breath underwater for four minutes and sometimes worked out with the high school football team near his home in western Fairfax County. No man in his forties could keep up with seventeen-year-old boys, but he was never that far behind them either. In his previous career these skills had all served one purpose: keeping him alive."
B000OT8GCG1,B000OT8GCG,"That gives anyone smart enough to check the paper a little flash and the illusion that he saw the h-gram when he really didn’t. ”

“ But you knew the difference,” Annabelle pointed out. “Because you used to make this paper about as well as anyone. ” She held up a pair of jeans. “ But from now on, I’d tell your supplier to take the time to stamp the brand name on the zipper like the real manufacturers do. ” She put the jeans down and picked up a handbag. “ And double-stitch the strap. That’s a dead giveaway too. ”

Leo held up a watch that was for sale. “ And real Rolexes sweep smoothly, they don’t tick. ”

The man said, “I’m really shocked that I’ve been the victim of counterfeit merchandise. I saw a police officer just a few minutes ago farther down on the pier. I’ll go and get him. Please don’t leave; he’ll want your full statements. ”

Annabelle gripped his arm with her long, supple fingers. “ Don’t waste your cover story on us,” she said. “ Let’s talk. ”

“ What about? ” he asked warily.

“Two shorts and then a long,” Leo answered, making the old man’s eyes light up.

CHAPTER 4"
B01D06KTR40,B01D06KTR4,"He smiled a broad smile and Katja could not help but think that he was a very attractive man. “Oxford. ”

“Oh, impressive! That is quite an accomplishment. ”

“For a black man , you mean? ”

“ I didn’t say that, John. I said it was an accomplishment, and it is… it’s quite an achievement whether you are black or white. ”

“ I’m sorry. That was rude. ”

“ It’s all right. ” She shrugged. “ I’ve heard a lot about Oxford, it’s very old and established. ”

“ Yes, that it is… and I was lucky. Even with all of the progress that civil rights have made, I was still one of the only blacks in my class. I suppose I must have filled a quota. ” He laughed a sad and bitter laugh.

She had never met anyone like him. In fact, he was the first black man she’d ever had a conversation with. Before this, Katja had not given much thought to the Ethiopian Jews she saw walking through the streets. But now she was starting to understand that life for people with black skin was in many ways the same as life for Jews. Strangers instantly hated them for no reason at all. “ What did you study? ”"
B01D06KTR41,B01D06KTR4,"”

“ Oh? ”

“ Yes, it’s a poverty-stricken area. Most of the people who live there are dark-skinned like me. The world is not as kind to dark-skinned people, especially men. So I studied hard, and when the time came for me to go to college, I got a scholarship to go to England and attend a University. My goodness,” he laughed. “ There are so many pigeons here. ”

Katja laughed, “I guess I have to say that the invasion of the birds in this part of the park is my fault. I feed them, and then they gather in clusters like this waiting and hoping for more. No matter how much bread I bring, there are always too many birds. Look over there. ” She pointed. “ You see other types of birds are also coming. Somehow, they know when someone is feeding them. Maybe they send messages to each other…messages like, ‘we have a sucker over here with lots of bread.’ ” She shook her head and smiled.

He laughed.

“ Where in England did you go to school? ” It was good to have someone to talk to, something to distract her from her worries."
B00JOG4TOY0,B00JOG4TOY,"It certainly was a cold one,” Tilly replied, remembering the icicles that had hung in thick shards around the doorway of their small stone cottage, as if her father had forged them in his blazing furnace and placed them there for decoration.

“ I can’t abide the winter months—or the autumn, for that matter,” Mrs. Ingram continued. “ Far too dark and miserable. Thank goodness for the spring, I say. It does wonders for a

person’s spirits to feel the sun on their face. Brings us all back to life. No wonder the daffodils look so jolly! ”

Tilly only smiled. She couldn’t entirely agree.

“ It’s as if the weather got inside you the day you were born,” her father said with a chuckle, his chestnut eyes sparkling in the reflection of the water as they sat by the edge of the lake. They were sharing a piece of delicious, still-warm gingerbread from Sarah Nelson’s little shop in the village. Tilly rolled her tongue around her mouth, collecting every last crumb from her lips as she rested her head on his broad shoulder. “ We’d never seen a storm like it that night— all raging wildness and dark clouds rushing across the sky. I’d say a piece of it got inside you all right, Tilly Harper. ”"
B00JOG4TOY1,B00JOG4TOY,"In more recent years, when she’d worked in service as a housemaid at Wycke Hall, the home of the local gentry, she’d become numb to the tedious conversations she overheard while going about her business, finding neither interest nor intrigue in the petty troubles of Lady Wycke and her tiresome daughters.

Many considered Tilly withdrawn, rude even. The simple truth was that she felt adrift, uncertain of herself, so that she had neither opinion nor comment to add. She busied herself instead with her chores: blacking the fires, scrubbing the hems of the ladies’ dresses, running the bed linen through the mangle, washing the steps, sweeping the floors, and beating great clouds of dust from the Turkey rugs, as if she might set herself free along with the spiraling dust motes, if only she could beat hard enough.

“ Although,” Mrs. Ingram continued, drawing Tilly back from her thoughts, “with today being Lady Day and the start of a new quarter, I suppose we should all be thinking about new beginnings, shouldn’t we, especially after that dreadful winter. My goodness— I’ve never known cold like it. I sometimes felt as though I’d set out to the South Pole along with Captain Scott and his men! ”

“"
B004G60EKK0,B004G60EKK,"Actually, we’d watched films there for a year before one of the other apprentices told us that they had been made to be watched without the sound track visible.

Today the cabaret theater was empty, the Christmas lights dark. I jogged on, moving from room to room, building to building, rounding up apprentices, workers, and family members until I met A. Bettik by the fountain and we joined the others in the large music pavilion.

The pavilion was a large space, with a broad stage and six rows of eighteen upholstered seats in each row. The walls were of redwood painted Cherokee Red (the Old Architect’s favorite color) and the usual thick desert masonry. A grand piano and a few potted plants were the only things on the red-carpeted stage. Overhead, stretched tight above a gridwork of wood and steel ribs, was the usual white canvas. Aenea had once told me that after the death of the first Mr. Wright, plastic had taken the place of canvas to relieve the necessity of replacing canvas every couple of years. But upon this Mr. Wright’s return, the plastic was ripped out—as was the glass above the main drafting room — so that pure light through white canvas would be the rule once again."
B004G60EKK1,B004G60EKK,"When we first arrived, Aenea and I were amazed to find that the Old Architect demanded that his apprentices and their families “dress for dinner” on Saturdays—ancient tuxedoes and black ties, of the sort one sees in the oldest history holos. The women wore strange dresses out of antiquity. Mr. Wright provided the formal clothes for those who failed to bring them in their flight to Earth through Time Tombs or far-caster.

That first Saturday, Aenea had shown up dressed in a tuxedo, shirt, and black tie rather than one of the dresses provided. When I first saw the Old Architect’s shocked expression, I was sure that he was going to throw us out of the Fellowship and make us eke out a living in the desert, but then the old face creased into a smile and within seconds he was laughing. He never asked Aenea to dress in anything else.

After the formal Saturday dinners, we would either have a group musical event or assemble in the cabaret theater for a movie—one of the ancient, celluloid kinds that had to be projected by a machine. It was rather like learning to enjoy cave art. Both Aenea and I loved the films he chose—ancient twentieth-century flat things, many in black and white—and for some reason that he never explained, Mr. Wright preferred to watch them with the “sound track,” optical jiggles and wiggles, visible on the screen."

B01L6R7UOO0,B01L6R7UOO,"There was something depressing about her.

By the time Ursula had finished unpacking and wandered across the landing to Nancy’s digs to see if she wanted to go to lunch, the American student’s room had undergone a dramatic transformation. Her bed was now fluffed up with a squillion-tog duvet, encased in a leopard-print cover. There were matching cushions and even leopard-print pillowcases.

“ I brought my own bedding,” said Nancy, flopping down on the newly plush bed.

The rest of the room was completely covered in clothes. As Ursula cast her eye over the sartorial chaos draped over the desk, chairs, and floor, she couldn’t help feeling slightly envious. There were party dresses and glittery shoes, skintight jeans and cropped tops, piles of sports gear, roller skates, hot pants, and several varieties of sneakers. There were jewelry cases bulging with tea-bag-sized diamanté earrings, ropes of faux pearls, and armfuls of bangles. There was even, Ursula noted, a pale vanilla-colored fur coat that glistened in the way that only real mink would. Nancy had a white vanity case, now open and with crystal perfume bottles and makeup spilling out of it, that took up almost the entire surface of her desk."
B01L6R7UOO1,B01L6R7UOO,"It didn’t take Ursula long to unpack her clothes with A-ha’s music to egg her on. In any case, she possessed an extremely limited wardrobe since, like most English girls, she had been dressed in the same ugly brown school uniform pretty much since she was eleven years old. She had a couple of tweed skirts, a few kilts, some Viyella blouses, several warm sweaters, and a few pairs of jeans and cords. She had one smart velvet dress that she had made herself, but her pride and joy was her one proper black-tie ball gown. It was beautiful, even if it was a hand-me-down from her grandmother, and if she was ever invited to an Oxford ball (please-please-please, God, let me be invited to a ball one day! she prayed), she could go. The only “trendy” things Ursula owned were her pair of Dr. Martens boots, a stripy pair of fingerless gloves, and a black satin bomber jacket, all precious birthday gifts from her groovy London godmother. Unsurprisingly, all of her clothing fit easily into the narrow wardrobe.

Ursula soon noticed a large white envelope addressed to her propped up on the mantelpiece. A mass of papers and notes fell out when she opened it."
B01N1HTUWI0,B01N1HTUWI,"I hear even in winter, the weather in the south of England is surprisingly mild. ”

“How—how—” Erica stammered.

“ We know a lot about you, my darling girl. For instance, how you’ve been leaving off your security checks from prison in Rouen, hoping your London office will notice and realize you’ve been captured. ” He smiled. “ Meanwhile, the Baker Street agents have noted your lack of security checks—and sent messages back scolding you that in the future you must be more careful with your coding. ”

Erica hesitated for a moment. Then, “I don’t believe you. ”

Von Waltz rose. He crossed to his desk, flipping through pages of her file, choosing one. Walking back, he handed it to her. “  ‘Your 5735 security check acknowledged,’ ” he recited from memory, taking his seat. “  ‘You forgot your double security check. Next time be more careful.’ ”

He studied her face, relishing the expression of abject shock on her bruised countenance. “ Yes, we have a mole in SOE. ”

She flinched. But who was the mole? And where? In France? Or in England?

Von Waltz continued, his voice still gentle. “ We know how frightened you are, Mademoiselle Calvert. You’ve been confessing your fears in your letters home to your father. ”"
B01N1HTUWI1,B01N1HTUWI,"What were you doing in Rouen, Mademoiselle Calvert? ”

“ I can’t say,” she managed through swollen lips.

“ Oh, come now. Sabotage? ” von Waltz suggested.

Erica shook her head.

“ To whom were you reporting? ”

“ I can’t say. ”

“ With whom were you working? ”

“ I can’t say. ”

There was a silence. “ Where are the secret stashes of arms and explosives you and your colleagues are bringing over here? ”

“I—”

“—can’t say, yes. ” Von Waltz smiled as he leaned back in his chair and crossed one slim leg over the other. “ And how did you enjoy your stay at Arisaig House? I hear the west coast of Scotland is quite beautiful, especially in autumn. ”

Erica’s breathing stilled. There was no way he could know that location— the location of SOE’s paramilitary preparation—or that she had trained there in September and October.

“You did quite well with your parachute school at Ringway. And how did you enjoy your time at Beaulieu? ” The Obersturmbannführer pronounced it in the English way, bew-lee. Beaulieu was the SOE’s so-called finishing school, where chosen agents were sent for their final round of training. “"
B077ZYS7PJ0,B077ZYS7PJ,"“ See who they are. ”

They ducked down, out of the way, behind a large tree.

Five minutes later, they could see them. A man and a woman, each with a large hiking backpack.

“ They don’t look dangerous,” whispered Cynthia.

“ I don’t know… ”

John’s gut was telling him not to be afraid. The pair was in their mid-twenties. If it hadn’t been for the EMP, they would have looked like normal hikers, not out of place on any serious trail in Pennsylvania.

But John’s brain was telling him that he needed to play it safe.

The hiker couple didn’t look like they were armed. They didn’t look like the types—not that that meant much these days.

John and Cynthia stayed hidden.

“ What do we do? ” whispered Cynthia.

John didn’t answer. He didn’t want to give away their position.

Instead, when the sound from the hikers got louder, John rose into view, pointing his handgun at them, holding it as steadily as he could.

“Don’t move,” he said loudly.

Cynthia rose up and copied John, holding her gun out too.

“ We don’t want any trouble,” said the man.

“Hands in the air,” said John."
B077ZYS7PJ1,B077ZYS7PJ,"4

John

John and Cynthia had been walking alongside the rural road for the last twenty minutes. They kept mostly within the tree line, in case a car passed by.

So far, they hadn’t seen anyone. John hoped it would stay that way.

“ I wish I knew how to use this thing, ” said Cynthia, holding up her handgun.

“Put that down,” said John. “ You’re going to shoot one of us by mistake. ”

“ I’ve got the safety on… I think. ”

“ Wow,” muttered John. “ Here, look, don’t put your finger inside this guard around the trigger. Not unless you’re going to shoot someone. ”

“ Makes sense,” said Cynthia, nodding, returning the gun to its holster. “ How’d you figure that out? ”

“Must have picked it up somewhere. Wait. ”

He grabbed her arm and held her.

“ There’s someone up there, ” whispered John. “ In the woods. Do you see them? Stay still. ”

Up ahead, there was the faintest bit of movement. A flash of a color. Synthetic, definitely not natural.

“ Yeah,” whispered Cynthia. “ I see them. What do we do? Run? ”

“ I don’t know. ”

“ Let’s wait,” said Cynthia."
B01CQF27NO0,B01CQF27NO,"Something sweet always curbed the craving, so he ordered a chocolate milkshake.

The waitress’s heavily lined eyes slightly widened with surprise. “ You got it, handsome. ”

Some guys envied the regular attention women gave Jackson. Most of the time, he wished to be more invisible. Especially in this case, because he had no interest in hanging out with an obvious party girl. Besides, meaningless flirtations usually made him feel lonelier—emptier—than ever. They made him yearn for the kind of love and family he’d always assumed he’d have by his thirties.

“ Thanks. ” He scanned the menu, then set it aside and glanced around the diner. An elderly couple sat in a corner booth, two middle-aged moms with toddlers in another. And at the end of the counter sat a scraggly-looking guy about Jackson’s age, drinking the beer Jackson would’ve liked to order.

Someday. Once he’d shown himself and others how they’d overreacted to his drinking.

The waitress pushed a tall, frosty shake in front of him. “ Ready to order? ”

“ Cheddar burger with onion and tomato, and fries. ” He smiled and handed her the menu, then returned his brother’s earlier text with a phone call."
B01CQF27NO1,B01CQF27NO,"He pushed through the door and stepped into the old diner. Like a lot of other places in this part of Vermont, it probably hadn’t been renovated since it was built. He stood surrounded by small black-and-white mosaic-tiled flooring, round vinyl stools at the counter, and no shortage of aluminum. The greasy aroma of the griddle invaded his nostrils, too, whetting his appetite.

He sat at the counter.

“Looks like you’ve been through the wringer. ” The bottle-redheaded young waitress smiled. She cocked her hip when handing him a menu. A tattoo of blood-red roses on a vine climbed up her forearm. Multiple piercings dotted her ears, and she’d painted her nails dark gray. “ How about a beer while you decide what you want? A Bud, or maybe you’d like my favorite, Switchback? ”

Ice-cold beer sounded perfect. He looked around, knowing no one here would think twice about a guy ordering a beer with lunch. After the storm he braved today, he deserved one, too. His family would never know. Just one cold beer to take the edge off.

His mouth began watering, but he stopped himself. He’d never been a liar, and he didn’t want to start today."
B00ZQH2UH80,B00ZQH2UH8,"I sighed and picked an imaginary string off my pant leg. “ Not that way. My husband is a werewolf, you know. So really not, if you know what I mean. ”

She blinked avidly. “ No. What do you mean? ”

“ Well,” I said, looking away from her as if I were embarrassed, and I half mumbled, “You know what they say about werewolves. ”

She leaned closer. “ No,” she whispered. “ Tell me. ”

I had heard the meeting-room door open, so I knew that the werewolves could hear every word we whispered.

I let out a huff of air and turned back to her. “ You know, every night is just fine. I’m good with every morning, too. Three, four times a night? Well . . . ” I let fall a husky laugh. “ You’ve seen my husband, right? ” Adam was gorgeous. “ But some nights . . . I’m not on the right side of thirty anymore, you know? Sometimes I’m tired. I just get to sleep, and he’s nudging me again. ” I gave her what I hoped would come out as a shy, hopeful smile. “ Do you have anything that might help with that? ”"
B00ZQH2UH81,B00ZQH2UH8,"A white witch, of course, who is using her powers for good. Our good. ” She giggled, which should have been odd in a woman of her age but instead was charming.

Her comment, though, disturbed me and made me pick up the bottle of Good Vibrations. I opened it and took a careful smell: rose, lavender, lemon, and mint. I didn’t sense any magic, and mostly if magic is around, I can tell.

LaBella wasn’t one of the witch family names, as far as I knew, but if “Tracy the Beautiful” was her real name, I’d have been surprised.

“ Now, this little gem”—Izzy’s mother pulled out yet another bottle—“this is one of my favorites, guaranteed to improve your love life or your money back. Does your husband ever have trouble keeping up? ” She held up a finger, then curled it limply downward as her eyebrows arched up.

The silence from upstairs was suddenly deafening.

“Uhm. No,” I said. I tried to resist, I really did. If Darryl hadn’t said, “Way to go, man—for a moment I was worried about you, ” I think I could have held out. But he did. And Adam laughed, which clinched it."
B0718WHGXK0,B0718WHGXK,"Afraid to be seen as proponents of the industry and afraid to outlaw such a revenue maker, all of them have parked their fat behinds on the fence. ”

“ That explains why they all walk around like they have sticks up their asses,” I said.

Mother hid her smile behind her napkin. “Crude, dear, but accurate. ”

“ I need some help here,” Dane said. “ You want to be taxed? ”

Mother shrugged. “ It’s tiresome always being the bastard child. ” She reached over and patted his hand. “ You’ll get used to Sin City. The people who don’t fit anywhere else find their spot in Vegas. ”

“ Square pegs and round holes? ”

“Precisely. ”

“Lucky, too? ”

“ Good heavens, no. She’s my iconoclast— she strives to be normal. ”

Dane threw back his head and laughed. “Exceptional, maybe. But normal? Never. ”

He thought I was exceptional—okay, maybe exceptional? Who knew? For some reason the thought pleased me. I tried to remind myself that all men are pigs, but I was having a hard time believing myself.

My mother settled back in her chair, a smile lifting one corner of her mouth. “ I think I’m going to like you, Mr. Dane. ”"
B0718WHGXK1,B0718WHGXK,"Adam’s apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed. He shifted in his seat, crossing his legs. Apparently, he was no different than all the others.

I hadn’t yet met a man immune to Mother. She feasted on men like a lioness on baby gazelles—hungry, but indifferent. Why couldn’t somebody develop a Mona vaccine? Competing with her for men totally sucked.

“ The tax bill? ” Dane finally found his voice.

Unable to help herself, Mona preened at his attention. “ The legislature is thinking of taxing our business much as they do all the other businesses. ”

“ Mother is a lobbyist for the Nevada Brothel Association,” I added.

Dane looked dumbfounded, but retained his composure. “ I see. And you are working to defeat the bill? ”

“ Oh, no. We want to be taxed like everyone else. That would give us some respectability, some legitimacy, if you will. At least that’s the general consensus. ”

“ Do you think you have a chance this time? ” I asked.

“ There’s always a chance, dear, but it’s not looking very good. Prostitution is still such a hot potato. The counties love the income, but the politicians like to pretend we don’t exist."
B06Y17ZKGS0,B06Y17ZKGS,"”

“Expecting another batch? ” Robyn looked puzzled. “ If he already has too many, why is he getting another batch? ”

“ He’s helping out the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — he’s a certified wildlife rehabilitator, you know. The finches he’s got were seized from an animal smuggling operation, and his contact there has dropped a hint that they could be seizing another big batch sometime soon, so he needs to find a place to put them. Normally he’d just send them down to the Willner Wildlife Sanctuary, but Caroline Willner is off on a cruise with her daughter, and the staff member she left in charge is digging in his heels. I’m sure as soon as Caroline’s back she’ll figure out a way to help out with the finches, but in the meantime Grandfather’s trying to bully everyone he knows into fostering a few. ”

“ I will stand firm, then, and refuse to be bullied! ”

Robyn dashed off toward the parish hall, where “Silent Night ” had given way to ominous silence —would she have to settle another quarrel over whether to sing “Adeste Fideles” or “ O Come All Ye Faithful ” to the traditional tune?"
B06Y17ZKGS1,B06Y17ZKGS,"Though if the agent can’t do anything, Mother thinks maybe it’s time to let Haver crash and burn. ”

“ Sadly, she might be right. And speaking of your mother, she’s due here in an hour for a meeting of the Christmas Toy Drive, so I’d better let you go. Just one more thing. ”

I braced myself. Like Columbo, Robyn sometimes delivered her biggest bombshells under cover of those harmless words “one more thing. ”

“ Why does your grandfather seem to think we should add finches to the church’s holiday decorations? ”

“ Oh, blast,” I said. “ So he’s hit you up, too? Just tell him no thanks. ”

“I did, but you know how persistent he is. Are finches really part of the traditional Australian holiday celebration? ”

“Not that I know of. The finches he’s trying to pawn off on you are Australian—they’re Gouldian finches. Very pretty birds— they have patches of red, turquoise, green, blue, and yellow— and they sing quite nicely. But they have nothing to do with Aussie Christmas celebrations. Grandfather just happens to have a surplus of Gouldian finches at the zoo and he’s expecting another batch any time now, so he’s trying to find places to put some of them."
B06XRP6ZL60,B06XRP6ZL6,"We have reason to believe that your roommate is in serious danger, and we need to bring him into protective custody. Please, help us to help him. ”

His gaze dropped to the off-white carpet. He bit his bottom lip hard enough to turn it white.

“ I’m not supposed to get the cops involved. They’ll kill him if I do. ”

“ We’re already involved, ” I said, “and we’re not going anywhere. So your best course of action is to level with us. Where is he, Luis?”

Luis paced the floor, shaking his head. He flailed a hand in strangled desperation.

“Houston is . . . he makes his money playing cards, okay? And he . . . he’s got a system. The kind of system where he never loses. ”

“ He cheats,” Jessie muttered.

“ I didn’t say that. I did not say that. Honestly, I don’t know how he does it. He just . . . when he needs cash, he goes to a casino, and he gets it. Simple. Except he got caught. The Diamondback, this place in Atlantic City. I told him the place is mobbed up, that he was pushing his luck. ”"

“ N-no ,” he stammered, “ I’m Luis. Houston isn’t . . . he’s not home. ”

“ Do you know where we can find him? ”

Luis swallowed hard. I’d interrogated murderers who looked less guilty. “ He’s out. Shopping. ”

“ Then you won’t mind if we wait for him,” Jessie said.

She smoothly stepped around him and into the apartment. Projecting her quiet authority and taking over the room. I followed her in and shut the door behind me, standing like a wall between Luis and the only way out.

“ He . . . he might be a while,” Luis told her. “ I mean, you shouldn’t waste your time. Just give me your card or something, and I’ll call you as soon as—”

“Luis,” I said, my voice firm enough to shut him up, “we’re not here to arrest anyone, and whatever you’re trying to hide, trust me: we probably don’t care."

The Patriarch proclaims that she’s the Heir of Novron, so everyone believes. I should have never made an enemy of the church. But between Saldur’s betrayal and their sentinel killing Fanen, I just couldn’t bring myself to bend my knee.

“ When I evicted the priests and forbade Deacon Tomas from preaching about what happened in Dahlgren, the people revolted. They set shops in Gentry Square on fire. I could see the flames from my window, for Maribor’s sake. The whole city could have burned. They were calling for my head—people right in front of the castle burning stuffed images of me and shouting, ‘Death to the godless king!’ Can you imagine that? Just a few years ago they were calling me a hero. People toasted to my health in every tavern, but now...well, it’s amazing how fast they can turn on you.

“ I should never have sent you,” Alric said, running a hand over his face. “ What was I thinking, making a woman an ambassador? ”

“Not again! ” Ellie had exploded. “ I’ll never, never go through that again. And who would want me? I’m fat and I’m rich! ”

Jeanne had blinked at Ellie a couple of times, then they both laughed at the absurdity of what Ellie had just said. Not many people looked on having money as something bad.

“ You know what I mean,” Ellie said. “ After what was done to me I’m afraid that people only want me for what they can get from me. ”

“ Yes, I know,” Jeanne said, surreptitiously glancing at the clock behind Ellie’s head. In these months they had made little progress in getting Ellie past what had happened to her, and the trauma was making Ellie stand still in life, unable to move forward. Three years ago, Ellie had been on top of the world with her great success as a writer, but now she rarely left her apartment. And to make matters worse, she’d given up nearly all forms of physical activity, so she’d put on forty pounds, and forty pounds on someone just five foot one was a lot of weight."

“ You can’t go through this birthday alone,” her therapist had said. Jeanne was now the only person Ellie saw on a regular basis. For three years now Ellie had retreated from the world, telling people that she needed time to “recover. ” But about eight months ago, after her second attempt at obtaining justice had failed, Ellie had sought professional help.

“ I don’t want to see anyone,” Ellie had said. “ Everyone knows me as I once was. ”

Jeanne had sighed. No matter what she said to Ellie, nothing seemed to penetrate the wall she’d put around herself. “ You still are who you always were. It’s time you got over this and went forward with your life. ”

“But who would even recognize me as I am now? ” Ellie said heavily.

Jeanne narrowed her eyes at Ellie. “ You can lose the weight."

""Maybe you don't know who we are,"" Bear said, as he delivered a pointed finger to Charles's sternum the way cops like to do. "" And I guarantee if you try to find out, you won't like the results you get.""

By this time, I was off my stool and attempting to wedge a hand in between the two Goliaths. Across the room, the three guys who'd accompanied Charles into the bar were on their feet and moving toward us. Each had one hand concealed, presumably wrapped around a pistol grip, or a knife, or a blackjack. Though I didn't relish the idea of facing any of the weapons, I preferred a man with a knife in this situation. Meant he'd have to get close to do any damage.

Charles lips parted and spread, a strand of saliva trapped between. He lifted both arms, took a step back. He never diverted his stare from Bear."

I ignored him.

Two thick fingertips pelted my right shoulder blade. ""I'm talking to you. Be best for you to answer me.""

Charles's rise in the Old Man's organization meant he had some clout behind him. But he also had something to prove. According to some, a lot to prove. He was a new captain, hustling out on the street to show his dominance, that he was the alpha in all situations now.

I turned toward Bear, looked over my shoulder, and nodded without making eye contact.

Charles looked me up and down. "" Don't bother getting up or anything. ""

""I won't. "" I spun forward and picked up my drink.

B076PRPPMM0,B076PRPPMM,"Mrs. Goodwin and the kids had walked across the street because they were curious about the two sheriff’s cars in front of our house. Mrs. Goodwin seemed a little concerned, maybe thinking we were the type of people who were always getting in trouble with the law. But Mom explained what had happened, that we had smelled something horrible and had discovered a rotting pile of dead dogs that Frank had left under our house.

“Frank? ” Mrs. Goodwin said incredulously. “ The Frank who sold us this house? ”

Mom nodded.

“ I can’t believe it! ”

“ Oh, believe it,” Mom said, and proceeded to tell her about our stolen furniture and the garage sale, and our discovery that Frank was infamous around town for not completing construction jobs and not paying back money he owed.

Dad and the deputies walked out from around the side of the house. One of the officers used the radio in his car to call the office, while the other one wrote something down on a clipboard as he spoke to the sheriff. Dad approached us. “ They said they’d gotten reports of five missing dogs in this area of town over the past three months. I think that’s them. ”"

Mom came back. “ They’re on their way. ” She glanced at the square black opening under the house. “ Who do you think could’ve—”

Dad looked at her. “Frank. ”

I could see that.

I imagined him in the middle of the night, skulking through the forest, between trees and bushes, going from house to house, looking for dogs that were tied up in their owners’ yards, then killing the animals and carrying them over his shoulder back to our place. I shivered. Just the thought of it freaked me out.

How had he killed them? I wondered. Poison, probably. He couldn’t have shot them because someone would have heard.

Why our house, though? We were letting him stay there. We were nice to him.

B06XJTQ3SZ0,B06XJTQ3SZ,"The letter is framed as a congratulatory missive, but everything about it—including the complex byplay of biblical allusion that was a hallmark of witty Jewish writing at the time—shows it to be mocking the irrationality and absurdity of anyone purporting to possess a philosophical education who embraced Christian dogma. “ Do not be like your fathers, who were brought by the principles of reason ineluctably to the natural, theological, logical and mathematical axioms,” writes Duran, tongue lodged firmly in cheek, “this is their way in their folly, my brother. ” Or, more pungently, in the phrase credited to the sixteenth-century converso Juan Beltran from Brihuega: “I worship thee, Oh carpenter! I worship thee, Oh carpenter! ”

This kind of comic Jewish triumphalism is reflected in one of the great narratives of the late medieval and early modern era: the Jewish pope, the child who’s been converted to Christianity (generally forcibly) and by dint of his intellectual superiority makes his way through the ranks to the top spot. Later centuries will make the comic aspects of the tale more explicit—I’m thinking of the one where Mrs. Greenstein visits the Dalai Lama and speaks only four words: “Sheldon, enough is enough. ” But one can be forgiven for thinking the comic tone was there, at least mutedly, all along: of course if a Jew was a Catholic, he’d be the pope. All the others, after all, have goyishe kep (simply and manifestly inferior) gentile intellects."
B06XJTQ3SZ1,B06XJTQ3SZ,"Tell me why it makes more sense for me to believe that a pregnant woman was divinely inseminated, and to worship three gods in one, rather than a single, transcendent, omnipotent creator; then we’ll talk. But since that kind of talk would get us expelled from our communities, if not worse, we’ll make sure we do it in a language you can’t understand.

Which was one of the reasons Jews were particularly anxious about Christians by choice, or, as they’re better known, converts, who did know the language, and drew on (and often slanted) their knowledge to compose some of the most anti-Jewish manifestoes of the period. But Jews’ attitude to these individuals—who were fairly rare in the medieval and early modern period—was generally scabrous, stemming from that same intellectual-theological superiority: Why would you possibly accept Christianity? It couldn’t be out of belief. And, often behind the cloak of Hebrew, they let them know it. Around 1391, a Jewish doctor named Profiat (or Profayt) Duran converted to Christianity in the Kingdom of Aragon and took the name Honoratus de Bonafide. While living an apparent life of Christian respectability, he wrote anti-Christian works in Hebrew. One of them, Al tehi keavotekha (“Do not be like your fathers”), composed three years after his conversion, is a satiric letter to David Bonet Bonjorn, another recent convert, who had apparently become a Christian out of genuine theological belief."

I didn’t answer. I was thinking. I was thinking, Why not replace Ilse Szrajbman with this girl? She was good-looking, well dressed, personable, intelligent, and, if she was to be believed, a good stenographer, too. Something like that was easy to prove. All I had to do was sit her down in front of a typewriter. And after all, I told myself, I could easily have gone to the Europa Haus, met the girl, and offered her a job, completely unaware of the way in which she chose to earn a little extra money.

Most Germans thought whores were little better than criminals, but I’d known enough joy ladies in my life to recognize that many of them were much better than that. Often they were thoughtful, cultured, clever. Besides, this one wasn’t exactly a grasshopper. She was quite used to behaving herself in a big hotel like the Adlon. She wasn’t a lady, but she could pass herself off as one."
B0030CVRFM1,B0030CVRFM,"I love the atmosphere of this particular hotel. I love the glamour. I love the feel of the sheets. And the big bathrooms. You’ve no idea how much I love the bathrooms in this hotel. ”

“Isn’t it a little dangerous? Joy ladies can get hurt. There are plenty of men in Berlin who like to dole out a little pain. Hitler. Goering. Hess. To name but three. ”

“ That’s another reason to come to a hotel like the Adlon. Most of the Fritzes who stay here know how to behave themselves. They treat a girl nicely. Politely. Besides, if anything went wrong, I’d only have to scream, and someone like you would turn up. What are you anyway? You don’t look like you work on the front desk. Not with those mitts on you. And you’re not the house copper. Not the one I’ve seen before. ”

“ You seem to have it all worked out,” I said, ignoring her questions.

“ In this line of work it pays to do the algebra. ”

“ And are you a good stenographer? ”

 “ I’ve never had any complaints. I have shorthand and typing certificates from Kürfurstendamm Secretarial College. And before that, my school Abitur. ”"
B06XW6YTKV0,B06XW6YTKV,"No one was as close or loyal as your own acknowledged heirs, everyone knew that. Thinking of it still made Ingray, herself a foster-child out of a public crèche, cringe unhappily. “ Nobody could have done it except Pahlad. ”

“ And for this e is cast permanently into an inescapable prison, what did you call it, Compassionate Removal? And declared dead? ” He took his hand off the crate. Put it back, when the crate shifted again, even though Ingray still held her end.

“E had betrayed eir parent! It was a huge scandal. And e showed no signs of remorse at what e had done. The whole thing had been very elaborate and cold-blooded. E managed to make copies of the things and put them in the lareum in place of the real ones, and there was Prolocutor Budrakim showing people around, you know, thinking they were the real ones, and no one knowing they were fake the whole time. And his foster-child Pahlad standing right there nearly every time, just as cool as anything, as though nothing was wrong. ” And after all, it wasn’t as though e was being executed. “ The copies were nearly perfect. ”"
B06XW6YTKV1,B06XW6YTKV,"Let me guess; he’s descended from an Elector who managed to secretly flee the system before the Radchaai burned everything. ”

“ But he is! ” insisted Ingray. “ He has proof. He’s got part of a panel from inside the shuttle his ancestor fled in, and a shirt with blood on it. And a lot of other things, jewelry and a half dozen of those little pentagonal tokens stamped with flowers that I think were from some kind of game. Or, he used to have those things. They were stolen. You really didn’t hear about this? ”

“I really didn’t. ” Captain Uisine sounded half sarcastic, as though the idea that he might have heard about something that had consumed the attention of everyone Ingray had known, and pretty much every major news service in Hwae System, struck him as ridiculous.

“ It was an inside job. Pahlad had grown up in Ethiat Budrakim’s household, and e had been given a post overseeing the lareum where the Garseddai vestiges were kept. ” There had been a lot of comment about how, while it was of course generous of prominent citizens to raise foster-children from less advantaged circumstances, or even the public crèches, it had been foolish of Ethiat Budrakim to trust Pahlad so implicitly."
B01HOEGPQM0,B01HOEGPQM,"It would be my honor, Mr. Spencer! ” Benjamin shot out of his chair to take a bow. “ It would be a great honor to see your charming daughter again. ”

Spencer emptied his cup. “ That’s settled, then. See you on Sunday. ”

Chapter Three

St. John’s Wood, June 1835

Benjamin Hopkins watched Sibylla, who looked very pretty in a cornflower blue dress, noticing how the color brought out her eyes. The blonde hair visible under her hat was coiffed in tight ringlets and the hat was secured with a coquettish side bow. The ladies with their parasols, colorful dresses, and patterned silk scarves resembled birds of paradise, and the gentlemen in their dark dress coats, top hats, and long slender pants seemed very elegant.

Three thousand Londoners had assembled at the cricket ground at St. John’s Wood in Regent’s Park on that warm Sunday in June in order to attend the most important social event of the season: the annual cricket match between Eton and Harrow, the two best schools in the country.

The game had been going since morning, and now Sibylla’s younger brother, Oscar, had just scored the winning run for his team. Time for tea."
B01HOEGPQM1,B01HOEGPQM,"This, after all, was the first time in thirteen years’ employment that he had been invited to tea with the boss.

Spencer stirred his tea several times, took a sip, and came straight to the point. “ How many barrels did we lose today? ”

“ Six, sir,” Benjamin replied anxiously. But seeing Spencer nod, he ventured to add that the insurance company would surely compensate them for the loss.

“Excellent, Hopkins, excellent. ” Spencer seemed well pleased. “ Go ahead and add the four barrels we lost from the Unicorn last year. What are we paying such horrendous premiums to those cutthroats for, anyway? ”

Benjamin nodded but wondered about the real reason he had been summoned. Had there been too many losses in recent months? But he was taken unawares by what Richard Spencer said next.

“ My son is taking part in his first cricket match next Sunday. ”

“ Your daughter had mentioned it, sir. ”

Spencer cleared his throat. “ Ah. So you know. Very good. Then perhaps you will join us at St. John’s Wood on Sunday and cheer the boy on. I’m sure my daughter would be pleased to see you. ”

“"
B01HEKF8QE0,B01HEKF8QE,"I glanced across and saw that she was admiring the elephant’s-foot umbrella stand. ‘Come on, Emily, let’s see if we can strike a bargain.’

She opened the door and we trooped in.

Inside was a cavern of infinite delights. I have travelled the world, seen the teeming markets in Shanghai and Calcutta, wandered the flea markets of Paris, and conducted more than my fair share of clandestine meetings in the back rooms of seedy little shops in London’s East End, but there was something altogether new and magical about the collection on display inside Pomphrey’s Bric-a-Brac Emporium. There’s junk, and then there’s a lovingly curated collection of surprising and interesting junk. And this was definitely towards the more entertaining end of the scale. There was a moose ’s head mounted on the wall wearing a topi and with the mouthpiece of an ornate hookah between its lips. Below it was a forest of candlesticks. There was a musical instrument section which, of course, included the usual selection of battered trumpets and euphoniums as well as a violin with faded lacquer, and a tarnished flute. But lurking among the everyday instruments were two crumhorns, a serpent and an ornate lute. One could, should one choose, start one ’s own Renaissance chamber group."
B01HEKF8QE1,B01HEKF8QE,"There was a silk scarf she quite admired, but despite many ‘oooh’s and ‘ahh’s, and even one ‘Oh, Emily, you’d look absolutely smashing in this’ from her friend, she remained largely unmoved.

The bric-a-brac shop, however, was a completely different kettle of fish. It was the last in a small row of shops set slightly back from the rest, giving it the appearance of being hidden away in a darkened corner. The shop front was curved, and several of the small, slightly grubby panes were of dimpled glass, giving it a very old-fashioned look. But it was what was on view behind that glass that captured my attention.

I’m not a great fan of old things usually but there was a romantic quality to the mismatched collection of near-junk in the window that made me desperate to get inside and explore. Amid the usual collection of chipped china figurines, glass vases of doubtful practicality, and tarnished silverware there was an elephant’s-foot umbrella stand, a brass diving helmet and a stuffed and mounted warthog head with wax oranges on its tusks. Next to that was a fish kettle, which served as a mount for a large stuffed trout.

‘We’re not buying it,’ said Lady Hardcastle, who had noted my interest.

‘Oh, but I might,’ said Lady Farley-Stroud."
B00V1YIYG60,B00V1YIYG6,"The Aldermaston’s warm hand reached forward and found hers. He clasped her hands within his and brought her closer. “ Welcome,” he said in a sincere, ponderous way. “ Welcome to Muirwood. We are so pleased you have come. You are the daughter of mastons, and now you will become one yourself. You are most welcome, Marciana. ”

“ Thank you, Aldermaston ,” Maia said, her voice trembling with emotion from the tenderness of his greeting. He looked at her as if she were his own daughter. She could feel the power of the Medium radiating from him like ripples of steam off a hot kettle.

As soon as the Aldermaston released her hands, his wife pulled her into a hug. Maia could feel the bones of the woman’s shoulder blades through the fabric of her cassock, and her nose was flooded with the welcome scent of purple mint. When the woman pulled away, she gazed at Maia with unmistakable warmth. “ Hello, Maia,” she whispered. Then she patted her cheek.

“Come with us to the house,” the Aldermaston said, and then gestured to Jon Tayt to approach. “ There is much we must discuss. You are Jon Tayt, our new hunter? Welcome, sir. Come with us. ”"
B00V1YIYG61,B00V1YIYG6,"Young men and young women walked the grounds, some wearing the finery of nobility, others wearing pale blue gowns and girdles or blue tunics and belts. She saw several—of both classes —look her way curiously. Some began whispering and pointing. Some looked very young.

“ How many learners are here? ” Maia asked, keeping her voice low.

“Forty or so. Many start when they are twelve or thirteen, but few make it to their fourth or fifth year. If someone has not passed the maston test by the end of their sixth year, they are sent away. ”

“ I am nearly nineteen,” Maia said, feeling the twist of anxiety in her stomach. “ I have not had enough time to prepare. ”

“Lia passed the maston test when she was younger than you, and she had never studied a tome in her life. Strength in the Medium comes from your Family. You already know how to read, and you speak multiple languages, which gives you an advantage over many of these learners. Some struggle to speak a sentence of Dahomeyjan, yet you are fluent. You have had more training than most of the learners. And your experience in the world . . . ” Her voice trailed off.

Following her gaze, Maia saw a man and woman were approaching them from the Aldermaston’s manor."
B000FC10VQ0,B000FC10VQ,"The wind had raveled away the cloud cover over Sandia Mountain and its dark outline bulked against the stars on the eastern horizon.

Ten stories below, the lights of the city spread toward the foothills, a lake of phosphorescence in an infinity of night. Behind him the radio announced that tomorrow would be cooler with diminishing winds. It then produced a guitar and a young man singing of trouble.

“ But,” the singer promised, “life goes on.

“ And years roll by,

And time heals all,

And soon we’re dead,

We’re peaceful dead. ”

The sentiment parodied McKee’s mood so perfectly that he laughed. He walked back to his desk—a bulky, big-boned, tired-faced man who looked at once powerful and clumsy. He shuffled the ungraded exam papers together, dumped them into his briefcase, poured a final martini from the shaker, and took it into the bedroom. He looked at the certificate framed on the wall. It needed dusting. McKee brushed the glass with his handkerchief.

“ Whereas,” the proclamation began, “it is commonly and universally known by all students of Anthropology that Bergen Leroy McKee, B.A., M.A., Ph.D., is in truth and in fact none other than MONSTER SLAYER, otherwise identified as the Hero Twin in the Navajo Origin Myth;"
B000FC10VQ1,B000FC10VQ,"Below, at Flagstaff airport, it registered gusts up to thirty-two knots—the dry, chilled wind of high-country spring.

On the west slope of the Lukachukai Mountains, the Wind People whined past the boulder where Luis Horseman was huddled, his body darkened by ashes to blind the ghosts. Horseman was calm now. He had thought and he had made his decision. The witch had not followed him. The man in the dog skin didn’t know him, had no reason to destroy him. And there was no place else to hide. Soon Billy Nez would know he was on this plateau and would bring him food, and then it would be better. Here the Blue Policeman could never find him. Here he must stay despite the Navajo Wolf.

Horseman opened his medicine pouch and inspected the contents. Enough pollen but only a small pinch of the gall medicine which was the best proof against the Navajo Wolves. He removed the turquoise bear and set it on his knee.

“Horn of the bica, protect me,” he chanted. “ From the Darkness to Be One, protect me. ” He wished, as he wished many times now that he was older, that he had listened when his uncle had taught him how to talk to the Holy People."
B00WHGBTHI0,B00WHGBTHI,"But her hair was still wet and her cheeks still had that post-run flush, and I felt a small swell of possessive pride that I got to see this polished women slightly unraveled, which was a bad impulse. I pushed it down.

“ Thanks for meeting with me,” she said, crossing her legs as she set down her purse. Which was not a purse but a sleek laptop bag, filled with strata of brightly colored folders. “ I’ve been thinking a lot about seeking something like this out, but I’ve never been religious before, and part of me still kind of balks at the idea… ”

“Don’t think of it as being religious,” I advised. “ I’m not here to convert you. Why don’t we just talk? And maybe there will be some activities or groups here that match what you need. ”

“ And if there’s not? Will you refer me to the Methodists? ”

“ I would never,” I said with mock gravity. “ I always refer to the Lutherans first. ”

That earned me another smile.

“ So how did you end up in Kansas City? ”

She hesitated. “ It’s a long story. ”

I leaned back in the chair, making a show of settling in. “ I’ve got the time. ”"
B00WHGBTHI1,B00WHGBTHI,"Poppy was one minute early, and the easy but precise way she walked through the door told me that she was accustomed to being prompt, took pleasure in it, was the kind of person who could never understand why other people weren’t on time. Whereas three years of waking up at seven o’clock had still not transformed me into a morning person and more often than not, Mass started at 8:10 rather than 8:00.

“Hi ,” she said as I indicated a chair next to me. I’d chosen the two upholstered chairs in the corner of the office, hating to talk to people from behind my desk like I was a middle school principal. And with Poppy, I wanted to be able to soothe her, touch her if I needed, show her a more personal church experience than the Ancient Booth of Death.

She sank into the chair in this elegant, graceful way that was fucking mesmerizing…like watching a ballerina lace up her slippers or a geisha pour tea. She had on that igniting shade of lipstick again, bright red, and was in a pair of high-waisted shorts and a blouse that tied at the neck, looking more ready for a Saturday yachting trip than a meeting in my dingy office."
B079D9FYPW0,B079D9FYPW,"And don’t ever go back into this forest ’less you got a torch in yer hand or daylight above. ”

Lavery took the wooden stave of the torch. “ I… um. I’m not sure how to get back. ”

“ No one never told you that you was a Wraith Walker, did they? Well, far as I know, you strange folk take yourself here and there by sheer will. You think about it, then yer gone. Best hurry, though—they say if you stay in the past or future too long, you get stuck there. ”

Lavery wasn’t convinced about this Wraith Walker business. But what other explanation could there be? He didn’t have time to concern himself with what this meant just yet. He needed to save his… they weren’t his friends, were they? They had kidnapped him, after all. Still, he was fond of them and most certainly did not want to see them die.

He imagined himself beside Elaya and Baern, pushing a ball of flame at the supposed witches. He pictured the roots receding, swallowed by the soil again.

And he was gone.

The bearded man shook his head and retreated back to his camp. Another story that no one would ever believe."
B079D9FYPW1,B079D9FYPW,"but they looked unnatural, came from nowhere. And all of a sudden the ground was moving and roots were coming out and attacking us. ”

The man grabbed at his beard. “Son, what year is it? ”

That seemed like an odd question to Lavery, but he answered it anyway. “ The year 1012 of the Malivian Calendar. ”

“ Holy mother of— I got myself a Wraith Walker here! Never saw one in action before. ”

“ I’m not a Wraith Walker. ”

“ Ya,” the man said, “you are. Unless yer a time-travelin’ demon o’ some sort. You’re from the year 1012, but guess what, son? You’re in the year 315 of the Malivian Calendar. ”

Lavery tried but could not quite unravel the tangled web of thoughts in his mind. If he was… if this was… then that meant…

“Is your party o’ folks not carryin’ torches? ”

Lavery shook his head.

“ Dumb bastards. Listen here, the four witches of—wait, did you say there were two? ”

“ Yes. I’m sure of it. ”

“Huh. There’s supposed to be four. Anyway, take this. ” He offered his torch to Lavery. “Light burns ’em. They’ll run away, shriekin’ and crowin’."
B06W584R3N0,B06W584R3N,"What do you want me to do, just circle the planet over and over again until they give up and go home? ”

Cal chewed his lip. “ Think that’d work. ”

“No!”

“ If I may be so bold as to make a suggestion, sir? ” said Kevin. “ I have analyzed the shielding and it appears to be a now mostly outdated piece of Zertex technology, model number BFS-Zero Dash Y Dash Three Seven Four Six Dash—”

“OK! Great. What about it? ” interrupted Cal.

“Nine,” Kevin concluded. “As I’m sure we’re all only too painfully aware, sir, this model was plagued by reliability issues, and replaced almost immediately by the upgraded BFS-Three Dash—”

“Kevin! ” Loren barked. “ We’re about to be swarmed by fighters. What’s your point? ”

The AI paused very deliberately before continuing. “ My point is, ma’am, the frequency modulation on this model was an unmitigated disaster. Embarrassing, actually. Hitting the shield at exactly the right velocity and precisely the correct point in its modulation cycle allowed ships to pass through unscathed. Smugglers took advantage of it all the time, I believe. I see no reason why we cannot do the same. ”"
B06W584R3N1,B06W584R3N,"Cal spun in his chair to find the girl gaping upwards in surprise. “ That’s Kevin,” he explained. “ He’s a living computer. ”

“ I am an artificially intelligent synthesized construct,” the voice corrected.

“ Which is a fancy way of saying ‘a living computer,’ ” Cal reasoned.

“ And my name is K-Seven-Zero Dash Nine-Three-Three-Zero-Seven Dash Zeta. ”

“ But we call him ‘Kevin’ for short,” said Cal.

“Cal! ” Loren barked. “ The shield. What do we do? ”

“ Why are you asking me? I thought you knew about this stuff? ” He looked from Loren to Mech. “ One of you must know a way through it. ” He smiled hopefully. “ Right? ”

“Can’t be done, man,” said Mech. “ When the shields are up, nothing gets in, nothing gets out. ”

A series of red dots appeared on a display near the bottom of the viewscreen. “Shizz,” Loren spat. “Incoming pursuit ships. Local law enforcement and a couple of Zertex fighters. ”

“ But we can outrun them, right? ” said Cal. “ We’re faster than they are. ”

“ Yes, but there’s nowhere to go! ” Loren reminded him. She realized she was pointing at the invisible barrier again, and stopped. “"
B01A8G7OHW0,B01A8G7OHW,"She noticed a scar on the back of his head where the hair had not grown back and wondered how he had got it.

‘ And do you share your aunt’s passion for wood, Miss Logan?’ he was quick to include her.

‘I’m in awe at what she does with it’ – Sophie smiled – ‘but I prefer my trees alive. I love nothing better than to walk through wild forests.’

Tam’s look was quizzical. ‘You can’t get much opportunity to do that around Edinburgh?’

‘ No, but The Memsahib allows me to reach the Border forests or get up to Perthshire.’

For a moment Tam was lost for words.

‘ She means her motorcycle.’ Amy chuckled.

‘Ah! Why memsahib?’

‘I grew up in India till I was six,’ Sophie explained. ‘It’s a bit tongue in cheek I suppose – my motorcycle is the boss, not me, I’m afraid.’

Tam laughed. ‘ How interesting. Some of us boys are training for the Indian Forest Service – me and Boz – and Rafi over there.’ He thumbed down the table at a dark-haired Indian who nodded and gave an attractive smile. Sophie noticed how at ease he seemed among them, yet there was something unsettling about him. Maybe it was just the mention of India again so soon after Tilly’s letter."
B01A8G7OHW1,B01A8G7OHW,"The men gave up one of their bunkrooms for the women, brought in hot water in a zinc tub and left them to change.

‘ Sorry, Auntie,’ Sophie apologised, brushing out her wet hair and pulling on a Fair Isle jumper. ‘I shouldn’t have insisted on leaving Jedburgh. Looks like we’re here for the night.’

‘ This is no hardship,’ Amy said brightly, ‘and maybe they can be a new source of cheap timber.’ She winked.

In the spartan communal mess room they sat around a scrubbed table with a dozen students and ate ham and egg pie, peas, kale and steamed potatoes.

‘ The lecturers don’t stay here,’ Tam explained. ‘ They prefer a comfy billet in Jedburgh or to drive out from Edinburgh for the day – make sure we haven’t thinned the wrong trees or raided over the border.’

He was delighted to find Amy’s interest in trees and they talked animatedly about different types of wood, their grains and suitability for furniture. Sophie observed him. There was an energy about him and a sense of fun that immediately appealed. Despite a beaky nose, he was handsome with a strong jaw, sharp blue eyes and a lean athletic build."
B073V4ZG760,B073V4ZG76,"This was the last year we would be stuck on bikes, ready to drive next year. If we passed our tests, of course.

We were best friends, and soon, we would have our freedom. Earlier in the day, we had ridden past our childhood treehouse, laughing as we remembered the silly blood oath we had taken, slicing our palms and shaking hands to prove our undying friendship. But we were almost grown up now, ready to get cars of our very own, and today was soon to become just another memory, like the treehouse.

We were on our way back from the pool, and had decided to swing by the gas station to grab slushies. We had spent an hour riding around aimlessly, and were now in a darker section of town, but I knew we were close to our neighborhood, we just needed to find the right turn.

“ This doesn’t look right, Callie,” Claire mumbled, ever the worry-wart.

“ We’re fine. We have to be close,” I said, scanning the street signs. I saw a trio of older boys standing just outside a lamppost, because dusk had fallen a while ago, and we both knew we were going to get yelled at for breaking curfew. “ Hey, look. We could ask them. ”"
B073V4ZG761,B073V4ZG76,"He’s a tough old root,” I whispered, not wanting to wake him. “ He’ll likely wake up bitching about merely needing a quick nap. Or demanding some prayer time. ”

A queasy look crossed Claire’s features. “ You really shouldn’t joke about that. It’s very important to him… ” she shivered, eyes darting to his chest. It was now covered by a sheet, but I still grew distant thinking about it. Who would have imagined to find that?

He had seemed almost dead, pale from blood loss, and when we had stripped him out of his wet clothes, we had seen his chest.

Gooseflesh pebbled over my arms at the memory. His chest had been… carved. That was the only way to say it. Etched with runes, symbols, numbered Bible verse references, quotes of scripture, and odd symbols I had never seen before, but suspected had something to do with the church. But why would the church carve him up? And why would he let them?

It had been a few hours, and I had been unable to sleep, even knowing we had maybe a few hours until sunrise. The rain had continued through the night, but even that hadn’t been enough to make me drowsy. Because my friend was hurt."
B01N4HIOVX0,B01N4HIOVX,"Couldn’t be, could he? ”

Sometimes Monk chose to be obstructive, to see how an interviewee changed what they said when they were off guard with annoyance. He decided to use this strategy now.

“ I don’t know,” he replied. “ I don’t think I’ve ever even known a Hungarian. What are they like? ” He kept his expression polite with some difficulty.

“ Like? ” she said stiffly. “ I don’t know what you mean. ”

“ You said he was not like us,” he reminded her.

“ Well, he wasn’t English, was he! ” she snapped.

“ I believe not. ”

“ You ever met an Englishman called Fodor? ” She raised her eyebrows.

“ No. Was he rude to you? Untidy? Disrespectful? Unclean? Noisy? Did you ever see him the worse for drink? Did he have women coming and going in the house? ”

She looked taken aback. “ Well…no. Except Mrs. Durridge, of course. She came and cleaned for him, and might have cooked, for all I know. ”

He got little more from Mrs. Harris, or the next people he spoke to. But the man behind the counter at the corner tobacconist’s was more forthright."
B01N4HIOVX1,B01N4HIOVX,"But a careful search of the rest of the house turned up nothing that seemed to tell of an unusual event. There was no diary, nothing marked on the calendar on the kitchen wall, no notes, letters or invitations.

“Start next door,” Monk said, peering up and down the street. “ Looks well kept, as if there’s somebody there a lot of the time. ”

Hooper smiled. “ Yes, sir. I saw the curtains twitch. ”

“ Right. I’ll go this way,” Monk said. “ You go that. ” He pointed in the other direction. “ See you at the station. ”

Hooper gave a half salute, and walked away.

They asked the neighbors all sorts of seemingly ordinary questions, trying to find anything unusual, or, at the very least, what they thought or felt about Imrus Fodor.

“ Nice enough man,” Mrs. Harris said, one door down to the right. She was about fifty, perhaps a year or two older than the victim. “ Not that I knew him, of course. Hungarian, he was. ” She added that as if it were an explanation.

“ Did he speak good English? ” Monk asked.

“ Ah… well, yes, I suppose so. But for all that, he wasn’t like us."
B00E9TY9A00,B00E9TY9A0,"His friend was sitting on the ground, watching the fire in awe. Jack walked over and sat down next to him.

“ Thanks. ” Jack’s voice was barely audible.

Chandler nodded.

The other soldiers joined them, and all four men stared into the flames, mesmerized. They all knew just how close they had come to a horrifying death.

Jack stared straight ahead as he spoke to Chandler. “ You have to get faster. ”

“ You have to get bigger,” Chandler replied with a smile.

They laughed.

Then Chandler pushed at Jack’s shoulder. Jack pushed back. Then Chandler pushed harder.

“ Wake up ,” Chandler said in a high girl’s voice and then pushed him again.

Jack looked down, puzzled. The hand poking his shoulder wasn’t Chandler’s now —it was small and white.

“ What? ” Jack’s eyes opened.

Replacement pushed his shoulder again. “ Are you getting up? ”

Half-dazed, Jack scooted away and almost fell off the bed. “ What’s the matter with you? ” he demanded.

“Me? You’re the bum. ” Replacement leaned in close. “ How late are you going to sleep? I thought you said you’d … ”

“Go away. ”

“… help me. When are we going… ”

Jack groaned."
B00E9TY9A01,B00E9TY9A0,"Lose the damn gun! ”

Chandler tossed it aside.

In under a minute, they made it to the front room where the other two soldiers were frantically shoving against the now-closed door.

“ It’s jammed. ” They pounded against the thick wood.

“MOVE,” Jack commanded, and even Chandler got out of the way.

Jack lowered his shoulder and hit the door as hard as he could. The door cracked, but it didn’t open.

Everyone started to yell.

“Do something! ”

“We’re all gonna die! ”

Chandler called out, “Out of my way! ” He charged across the room and rammed the door. The force of the impact was so strong it moved the wall itself. The door held—but the frame didn’t. The wooden frame and chunks of concrete, with the door still attached, fell forward and landed in the dirt.

The four soldiers scrambled out and ran.

The building behind them exploded.

Jack stopped and looked back in terrified fascination. Flames shot out through the hole where the door had been; they looked like dragon’s breath. The fire was so hot it flicked blue and white before wrapping together into red and yellow streams that floated skyward.

He looked around for Chandler."
B01LYWAZSA0,B01LYWAZSA,"It must have been taken several years ago when they had been scouts there together.

“Are you still working at Wadsworth? ” I asked her.

She shook her head. “ No, I transferred to Haverton College a few years ago. But I’m coming up to my retirement soon. ”

“ Well, don’t just stand there—sit down ,” said Dora briskly, waving her friend over to the table. “ I’ve just got to finish this off but I won’t be long. ”

“ Would you like a cup of tea? ” I asked.

“ Oh, please don’t bother on my account,” said Miriam quickly. “ I only came by to ask Dora if she would be free to come with me to see my mother. Mum’s in a home , you see,” she explained to me. “ She’s got advanced dementia and … well, they’re having some trouble coping with her. ”

“ They don’t want the trouble, you mean,” said Dora darkly. “ That place is a disgrace! They neglect their residents dreadfully and just do the minimum possible. ”

Miriam looked distressed. “ Yes, they don’t seem to make much effort. I know Mum can be difficult and she really needs specialised care, but they don’t seem to try at all…”"
B01LYWAZSA1,B01LYWAZSA,"When I had met Dora, she had been down on her luck and practically fainting from hunger—mainly because of her own stubborn pride and unwillingness to admit that she needed help. It had taken a bit of persuasion for her to accept the position of baker here at the tearoom but it was an arrangement that was working out great so far. Dora’s baking was absolutely divine and helped my tearoom maintain its reputation as having the best scones in Oxfordshire. And I quickly learned that beneath her stiff, prickly exterior was a kind and warm-hearted soul— although she was still very proud and sensitive to anything that she considered “charity ” from anyone.

Now her eyes lit up as she glanced over and saw her friend standing in the kitchen doorway.

“Miriam, how nice to see you! ” Dora hurried over, pushing back a wisp of grey hair and leaving a smear of flour on her temple. She turned to me and said with a smile, “ This is Miriam Hopkins. She and I used to work as scouts together at Wadsworth College. ”

I realised why Miriam Hopkins had seemed familiar. I had seen a framed photo on Dora’s hall table, showing the two friends in pinafore aprons, standing together in the front quadrangle of Wadsworth College."
B06WWR2Q5Y0,B06WWR2Q5Y,"With a nod, I head across the hall to my apartment and grab a treat from the large jar on the kitchen counter, then rush back over to his place.

“Muffin! Treat! ” I sing as I walk through the door, then cross my arms over my chest and stare. Levi’s standing over Muffin rubbing her belly and cooing at her like she’s a small child. “ She’s not going to want to leave if you’re doing that. ”

“ If I didn’t have to work I would say she could stay, but I need to leave soon. ” He gives her one last rub as he looks at his watch.

“ What kind of work do you do? ” I hold the treat close to Muffin’s mouth, then pull it away when she tries to snatch it, hoping she will follow the treat — but she doesn’t.

“ I’m a detective with the NYPD. ”

“ Well, thank you for your service. ” I smile, then continue softly, “ My dad’s a detective out on Long Island, so I know how difficult your job can be. ”

“ It’s a lot of work, but it’s also very fulfilling,” he agrees. “ Where do you work? ” he asks after a moment of watching me try to tempt Muffin off the couch with the treat."
B06WWR2Q5Y1,B06WWR2Q5Y,"You’re a good girl,” he coos, walking toward her, and I know this is when she’s going to show her true colors and try to attack him. But of course it’s just my luck that she stays still and allows him to pet her. “ You just need to be the alpha,” he tells me with a devastatingly smug smile while my girl rubs against him with her tail wagging. So much for dogs knowing anything about girl code!

Okay, I’m officially jealous of my dog.

“ She likes you,” I whisper in shock as she licks his palm.

“Most women do. ” He grins, and I roll my eyes even though I’m sure it’s true. Most women are attracted to assholes—it’s human nature.

“ Let’s go, Muffin. ” I clap my hands against my thighs, and she looks at me, then back at Levi.

“Come on, girl, let’s go,” he commands as he turns for the door.

“ Yeah, the alpha thing is totally working. You should write that down for me. ” I snicker as she climbs back onto his couch and lies back down.

Sighing, he looks at Muffin, then runs his hand through his hair. “ Why don’t you go get her a treat and I’ll wait here for you to come back. ”"
B0777P4Z4J0,B0777P4Z4J,"” Ranta shouted.

In addition to the five lookouts, the residents Haruhiro had seen had all hidden their faces with cloth or something similar. Haruhiro had thought that strange, too, and it had caught his attention.

From there he came to the theory, “Covering your face is the condition for entering the village. ” That was fine, but risking life and limb to test the idea... That was reckless.

Was it okay to let it slide because it had all turned out fine in the end? He worried over that a bit as leader. What should he do? He had an idea.

“Ranta. ” Haruhiro rounded on him with a serious attitude. “ It worked out, so it’s fine. But, still. What would you have done if it hadn’t? What would have happened? Did you think about that, even a little? ”

“Huh? I don’t have time to think about that stuff, moron. Besides, I’ll have you know, Ranta-sama is never wrong. ”

“ You could have been in serious trouble. That’s what I’m trying to say here. ”

“ H- Hey, it’s my life, I can do what I want with it, okay? I’m a free man, you know... ”"
B0777P4Z4J1,B0777P4Z4J,"Then, leaving the clearly flummoxed lookout behind, Ranta came back to Haruhiro and the others in high spirits.

“There! How’d you like that?! I was right, huh! Bow down before me! Worship me! Also, you women, let me touch your boobs! ”

“I’m never letting you touch them... ” Shihoru said, covering herself with both arms.

“ Ranta, you’d probably end up hurtin’ them if you did. ” Maybe she just didn’t understand, but Yume occasionally said things that were slightly weird. Haruhiro wished she would be more aware of these things, but it was hard to caution her about it.

“ But...” Merry tilted her head to the side. “ Why? They seem to be pretty blatantly wary of outsiders. ”

“ It’s a mystery, for sure. ” Kuzaku couldn’t seem to accept it, either.

“ Could it be— ” Just as Haruhiro was about to say it, Ranta cut him off.

“ You moron! It’s my job to give the answer here! I had flash of inspiration! Don’t steal my thunder, Parupirorin! ”

“Ehe... Your face... You hid your face... That’s why they let you in... Ehehe... ”

“Zodiac-kun?! You’re gonna tell them that?! Hey?! I wanted to be the one to say it, you know?!"
B0782R637L0,B0782R637L,"My first thought was that somebody had forgotten it,” he repeated, “ but then I thought about The Lavender. You know, there was word going around the pub last night that the young woman was hit over the head with a golf club. Of all the sorry ways to meet your maker,” Sykes marveled. “ That was the rumor, anyway, unless my old hearing let me down again? ”

“ No, you’re quite right,” Stevens said. “ We’re pretty confident the murder weapon was a driver. ”

“ Well,” Sykes said, relieved not to be entirely losing his marbles, “I got myself wondering if one of your policemen might like to have a look at it. ”

Stevens gave Cliff a meaningful glance and then reached for his cell phone. “ DI Graham? ” he confirmed. “Chris Stevens, SOCO… Yes, I’m in the shed in the back garden. I think I’ve just met the world’s oldest man,” he quipped. “ Yes … At least a hundred and fifty… ” Sykes grimaced comically, enjoying the moment. “ And the thing is, sir… I’m pretty sure he’s just brought me the golf club which was used to murder Norah Travis. ”

CHAPTER SIX"
B0782R637L1,B0782R637L,"His bacon sandwich daydream had receded alarmingly, and he was keen to get it back on track.

“ I found this driver in the bunker on the fourteenth,” he said, lifting the club on which he’d been leaning. “ Wondered if one of your guests had forgotten it. Funny place to have a driver out, wouldn’t you say? The middle of the fairway, with bunkers all around? ”

Cliff wisely decided not to touch the driver but motioned to Stevens, who took it between gloved thumbs and forefingers as though it were a holy relic. “ Where precisely was this found, Mr. Sykes? ” Stevens said, excitement in his voice.

“Half-buried, it was,” Sykes reported. “ Like someone tried to hide it there, and either did a rotten job or someone else dug it up part of the way. I found it sticking out of the bunker like a bit of old shrapnel on a beach. ”

“ And when did you make this discovery? ” Stevens asked, already preparing to swab the metal where the club would meet the ball. Or the back of Norah Travis’ head, he allowed himself to hope.

“Not an hour ago ,” Sykes replied. “"
B01MXNT92E0,B01MXNT92E,"The pulsating heat started moving up my spine again, small flames of desire burning through my skin.

“ Yes. ” He dropped a gentle kiss on my mouth. “ I didn’t think you could be lovelier than earlier,” he murmured.

“Earlier? ”

“ I thought you were beautiful when you walked in the room,” he explained. “ But now, seeing you look like this? You are exquisite. ”

“Like this? ” I asked. I was, it seemed, unable to do anything, except repeat the words that came out of his mouth. His perfect, sexy mouth.

“Hmmm. The way you feel pressed up against me. Your lips all swollen from mine, your cheeks flushed, and the way your eyes are looking at me. You’re a siren, Avery. ” He growled. “ A fucking siren. ” He buried his face in my neck, his tongue swirling over my skin, trailing a hot, wet path up to my ear and tugging on the lobe. “ I know we were only supposed to kiss, but I want you. God, I want you so much. ”

I groaned, arching toward him. I could feel how much he wanted me. I wanted him. I had never experienced desire like this until now. Until this man."
B01MXNT92E1,B01MXNT92E,"There was no going back now—and neither of us wanted to.

My hands tightened on his neck, needing his mouth back. His head lowered, and I whimpered as his lips hovered over mine.

“ Well, I think we got what we wanted. ” Beth’s shocked voice exploded in the room. “ We’re done. ”

Daniel’s head snapped up; his startled gaze meeting mine. We had forgotten we weren’t alone. However, his grip didn’t loosen and he didn’t move away.

“ Okay, good,” he said roughly over his shoulder, barely sparing a glance her way.

“We’ll, ah, just, um, leave you to, yeah, ah, finish up. Or whatever . . . you, ah, want. Yeah. Come see me before you leave, Avery. ”

Hurried footsteps and the quiet click of the door let me know I was now alone with Daniel. I shut my eyes, letting my head fall back to the wall with a small thud.

“ Hey. Look at me. ”

I opened one eye, squinting at him.

His smile was wide. “ Can you, ah, see me? ”

“When you’re this close, yes —well, mostly, anyway. Can you see me? ”

His face moved closer, his lips a mere breath away from mine."
B07BC5BR4D0,B07BC5BR4D,"As he stared at his hand he entered a faraway world, where nobody else existed, except his own thoughts.

Ten fingers.

No red marks.

Nothing broken.

Yet, something.

Something.

He felt the pressure of his attorney's grasp on his arm.

""What's up Alan? You okay?""

He pulled back to stare at the man and for one second his name disappeared from Alan's memory. Then as though smoke had cleared in his head, he pulled himself together, just enough to reply.

""Man, I'm sorry, I, um, no, not okay. Sorry.""

He remembered what he was meant to do then.

Say sorry. Yes, keep saying sorry. Get the kid on his side.

Unable to look at the girl directly, he half-turned his head, so his jaw jutted forward instead.

""Sorry. Just sorry. I gotta go.""

He knew if he stayed in that room any longer he would be sick. He was already trying to stand when she spoke.

Her voice sounded happy though, and that confused him. Happy wasn't what you'd expect. And that near-joyful tone was what he remembered later when he began to understand what must have happened.

""That's okay,"" she said. ""Everything will work out fine. In the end, I'm sure you'll be very sorry."""
B07BC5BR4D1,B07BC5BR4D,"Her eyes held the faintest of glimmers; a flickering lamp in a window. The glow grew, and in unison heat rose in him, real heat on his face and inside his skin.

With every fiber of his willpower he tried to avert his eyes. But as though she possessed a magnetic power, he couldn't look away. The words he'd only just uttered coiled in his head like smoke.

If I could trade places with your, with your¬-

He couldn't focus; his brain afire, and he needed to get away, return to his cell, close his eyes and not see her anymore.

Suddenly she reached out to grasp his hand, still with that weird I'm-gonna-eat-you smile on her face. His stomach curdled at her touch. He expected her skin to feel hot or freezing, or like a static electric shock. He expected pain.

Nothing.

Just her hand touching his.

Something though, something he didn't understand happened.

He snatched his hand back, whipped it away from her and heard Weasel Face's voice.

""Hey, hey, what are you doing?""

Alan didn't care. Forget their stupid plan.

He shoved backward with all his strength, almost toppling over. The sound of the metal chair's legs loud and achingly high-pitched in the small room."
B003ZK58VI0,B003ZK58VI,"Closing his eyes, he summoned that which would carry him over the miles between Caldwell and where Isaac had been seen last. . . .

Jim’s massive wings unfurled on his back, the span of iridescent feathers stretching out and flexing like limbs that had been cramped. When his lids lifted, Eddie and Adrian were sporting theirs as well, the two fallen angels magnificent and otherworldly in the light of the streetlamps.

As a car drove by on the street, it didn’t screech to a halt or get derailed from its lane. The wings, like him and Eddie and Adrian, were neither there nor not there, real nor unreal, tangible nor intangible.

They just were.

“ You ready,” Eddie asked.

Jim glanced back at where his earthly form was now not only frozen stiff but a beacon for a man he’d come to hate.

Even though he’d saved the fucker’s life.

“ Yeah, let’s do this. ”

Up, up, and away, and all that shit : In the blink of an eye, they were flying through the dark heavens and the sparkling stars on the strong, steady wings of Angel Airlines, as he called it.

Aloft and alive, he resumed his hunt for a hunted man . . . and headed off for Boston with all proverbial guns blazing."
B003ZK58VI1,B003ZK58VI,"But this wasn’t about him and Matthias.

Jim pulled the sheet back into place, covering his own face and wondering how long it was going to take for the spell to call Matthias here and for Jim to see the guy again.

He slid the table into the refrigerator and shut the door, cutting that phosphorescent blue glow off. “ Let’s blow this joint. ”

He was quiet on the way out, lost to the bad memories of what he’d done and who he’d killed while in XOps. And what do you know. In addition to his adrenal glands, it seemed like his personal demons had also survived his death. In fact, he had a feeling his regrets were eternal luggage: The not-so-hot part about being immortal was that there was no endgame to be had, no prospect for getting off the ride that you could hold on to when things got rough and overwhelming . . . and you despised yourself.

As he and his comrades reemerged onto the funeral home ’s side lawn , it was back to the hunt for Isaac Rothe.

“ I’ve got to find that man,” he said grimly. Although it wasn’t likely they’d forgotten what they were doing."
B076PDCQ610,B076PDCQ61,"She narrowed her eyes at him. “ What is a gorilla? ”

Merlin sighed. “ So much is lost on you, child. It’s a tragedy at times. ”

Elan rolled her eyes, irritated but fully aware that meant he wasn’t going to enlighten her. She continued into the library, now mumbling about something else entirely. Merlin watched her as she made her way to a familiar table, where a book was waiting for her, as it had been ever since she’d first found it.

It was an old book.

Older than the library it sat in, which was nothing to scoff at. Old enough, in fact, as to defy any method of dating he was aware of, which, again, was nothing to take lightly. It was bound in leather, of some animal that he had no record of, and the pages were organic . . . yet did not deteriorate. On the cover, the lettering was gold . . . the only element of the book he could identify with certainty, in fact, and it read simply . . .

Ein Taki Amin Kine.

Merlin only knew what it meant because someone had once told him.

To Walk the Path of the Knight."
B076PDCQ611,B076PDCQ61,"Of course, Merlin was only guessing about that since he’d never before been forced to deal with pubescent humans in any real fashion, so he only had second- and thirdhand experiences to judge by.

So far, they were all proving somewhat lacking.

“ I don’t suppose you’d like to talk about it? ” he asked as mildly as possible.

“Nothing to talk about,” she grumbled, shoving open the large doors to the library. “Caleb is an idiot. ”

“Ah. Boys,” Merlin said with a hint of distaste. “ And that is where I end my part of this discussion, fascinating though it clearly would have been. I have no desire to know the details of your mating practices. ”

She paused between steps, leading foot hovering just over the floor as she turned and gave Merlin a gimlet eye.

“ Don’t,” she said firmly. “ For one, just . . . yech. And two, even if that were true , you are the last person I would discuss it with. ”

“ Indeed,” Merlin deadpanned, “and for that I am, and shall remain, infinitely grateful. Believe me, I am sorry I asked. Please, continue stomping through the halls like a sodden gorilla. ”"
B072BFKHT70,B072BFKHT7,"I realize Daphne always had her hand in supervising Cavendon Hall, especially when it came to keeping up the décor of the rooms, checking for leaks, and making lists. And keeping Ted and Paul Swann informed, showing them any damage. ”

“ That’s not a difficult task, Ceci. We will ask every family member to keep an eye open for such things. I’m afraid Daphne overdid that aspect of the house in a sense, always on top of the carpentry shop, pushing Paul in particular. ”

“ I know that,” Cecily replied. “ Let’s not forget that Eric and Peggy haven’t left with her for Zurich. ” There was a sarcastic edge to her voice when she added, “They run the domestic side of Cavendon. Daphne didn’t do that anymore, and hasn’t for years. Eric inherited Hanson’s mantle well. He’s a wonderful head butler, and Peggy Swift is an amazing housekeeper … I don’t think they need my hovering around them. ”

“ That’s true. But you have spent a lot of time in London, and when it comes down to it, the countess should be here on a regular basis. ”

“ Let’s not forget that I’ve been in London for my business, not having a good time! ”"
B072BFKHT71,B072BFKHT7,"Also, Dulcie has her art gallery … mind you, she gives us the profits from the one here at Cavendon. ”

“ She’s always been keen to help out, and actually those two houses they live in are taxed by the government as part of the estate taxes. ”

“ Then you have no choice,” Cecily answered emphatically.

Miles stood, walked over to the window, looked out at the moors. There was a prolonged silence before he finally returned and sat down with Cecily. Taking hold of her hand, he said, “Daphne’s departure is going to be a burden for you in some ways. I think we must discuss the problems now, get them done with. ”

“ I have to be at Cavendon all the time, run it myself now, don’t I? ” Cecily replied, detecting the seriousness in his voice.

“You do, darling , You must take on the full responsibilities as chatelaine. After all, you are the seventh countess. And you must manage all the village events and be part of village life. The three villages. ”

“I have been doing quite a lot of that over these many years,” Cecily protested, her voice rising slightly. “"
B004V5180G0,B004V5180G,"For the last three years, she’d been tutor to Regan and social secretary to Chris.

“ Oh, the usual crock. ” Chris sauntered to the table and began to sift messages. “ Anything exciting? ”

“ Do you want to have dinner next week at the White House? ”

“ Oh, I dunno, Marty; whadda you feel like doin’? ”

“ Eating candy and getting sick. ”

“ Where’s Rags? ”

“Downstairs in the playroom. ”

“ What doin’? ”

“Sculpting. She’s making a bird, I think. It’s for you. ”

“ Yeah, I need one, ” Chris murmured. She moved to the stove and poured a cup of hot coffee. “ Were you kidding me about that dinner? ” she asked.

“ No, of course not,” answered Sharon. “ It’s Thursday. ”

“Big dinner party? ”

“ No, I gather it’s just five or six people. ”

“ Hey, neat-o! ”

She was pleased but not really surprised. They courted her company: cabdrivers; poets; professors; kings. What was it they liked about her? Life?

Chris sat at the table. “ How’d the lesson go? ”

Sharon lit a cigarette, frowning. “ Had a bad time with math again. ”

“Really? That’s strange. ”

“ Yeah, I know; it’s her favorite subject. ”"
B004V5180G1,B004V5180G,"He nodded curtly toward the young man, and with lowered eyes, he moved quickly toward a door that led into the church. Once again the cottage door was pushed open from within. Another priest. It looked— Hey, it is! Yeah, the one who was smiling when Burke said “fucking ”! Only now he looked grave as he silently greeted the new arrival, putting his arm around his shoulder in a gesture that was gentle and somehow parental. He led him inside and the screen door closed with a slow, faint squeak.

Chris stared at her shoes. She was puzzled. What’s the drill? She wondered if Jesuits went to confession.

Faint rumble of thunder. She looked up at the sky. Would it rain? … the resurrection and the life ever…

Yeah. Yeah, sure. Next Tuesday. Flashes of lightning crackled in the distance. Don’t call us, kid, we’ll call you.

She tugged up her coat collar and slowly moved on.

She hoped it would pour.

A minute later she was home. She made a dash for the bathroom. After that, she walked into the kitchen.

“Hi, Chris , how’d it go? ”

Pretty blonde in her twenties sitting at the table. Sharon Spencer. Fresh. From Oregon."
B01KQRGUVE0,B01KQRGUVE,"While he didn’t grieve for the brave knight, he certainly appeared to mourn the loss of a chance to raid Benthwaite. Like a greedy buzzard, he waited to descend upon the carcass of the mountain once its protector had been slain.

One by one, men died in the pursuit of treasure beyond their wildest dreams and a promise of more gold crowns than they could reasonably spend in their lifetime.

The next adventurer, a quiet, thoughtful man from Liang, listened as the king described his troubles and said he would only accept payment upon completion of the job.

“ This dragon, it must be a young dragon,” the stranger said, stroking his black mustache with his thumb.

“ I care not of its age. I care that it is killed soon,” her father said.

“I will need time to prepare for this, but I can dispatch your creature. I will require much time. ”

Weeks passed, but he never returned.

The fifth respondent arrived on an overcast Sunday afternoon. Ana knew he had to be a prestigious member of some royal family when the servants began to fret and hastily flutter about the palace like chickens with lost heads, clucking over his handsome qualities, the wealth of his kingdom, and his bachelor status."
B01KQRGUVE1,B01KQRGUVE,"Victoria sobbed beside her as she rushed for the opening castle doors, and in the distance, the dragon’s immense shape grew larger and larger with each heartbeat slamming in Ana’s chest. The blood rushed in her ears, the sound of her own pulse deafening over the screams of the men moving into their positions. They were ready to die to defend the castle.

And it was unnecessary. All of their preparation was in vain.

The dragon soared by on magnificent ruby wings but waged no assault on the palace. As he passed the courtyard, the monster dropped a charred lump of metal. Sir Henry, welded within his armor and long dead, resembled a piece of coal melded with blackened steel. After a defiant roar, the beast flew away and was soon out of sight.

King Morgan strode past both girls without a word. Anastasia watched him approach the unmoving corpse. He stared at it, trembling with rage.

The message was quite clear.

“Send word to the other kingdoms. This beast will die. No request is too great, no price too high. I will grant anything to the man who puts an end to this dragon. ”

Chapter

KING MORGAN’S AUDIENCE chamber became quiet over the weeks following Henry’s demise."
B000JMKVBW0,B000JMKVBW,"Everything fallen from you except the possibility of jolting and unforewarned memory springing out of the dark, rushing over you with the velocity of heartbreak. May walking down the hall humming an old song—“The Girl I Left Behind Me”—or the mere fragrance of clove in spiced tea can set you weeping and howling when all you’ve been for weeks on end is numb.

At least that last one is explainable. Back in green youth, Claire became an advocate for flavored kisses. She would break off new spring growth at the end of a birch twig, peel the dark bark to the wet green pulp, and fray the fibers with her thumbnail—then put the twig in her mouth and hold it there like a cheroot. After a minute she’d toss it away and say, Now kiss me. And her mouth had the sweet sharp taste of birch. In summer, she did the same with the clear drop of liquid at the tip of honeysuckle blossoms, and in the fall with the white pulp of honey-locust pods. And in winter with a dried clove and a broken stick of cinnamon. Now kiss me.

AT MAY’S URGING, I recently agreed to buy an Edison music machine. The Fireside model. It cost an unimaginable twenty-two dollars."

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

1

THERE IS NO SCATHELESS RAPTURE. LOVE AND TIME PUT ME IN this condition. I am leaving soon for the Nightland, where all the ghosts of men and animals yearn to travel."
B000W5MIGC0,B000W5MIGC,"technique…You just have to work with the known facts about the individual concerned. Of course, with this one such a lot is known. ”

“ And you’ve worked it all out, have you? ” said Downey, almost fascinated.

“ Oh, a long time ago, sir. ”

“ When, may I ask? ”

“ I think it was when I was lying in bed one Hogswatchnight, sir. ”

My gods, thought Downey, and to think that I just used to listen for sleigh bells.

“ My word,” he said aloud.

“I may have to check some details, sir. I’d appreciate access to some of the books in the Dark Library. But, yes, I think I can see the basic shape. ”

“ And yet… this person…some people might say that he is technically immortal. ”

“ Everyone has their weak point, sir. ”

“Even Death? ”

“ Oh, yes. Absolutely. Very much so. ”

“ Really? ”

Downey drummed his fingers on the desk again. The boy couldn’t possibly have a real plan, he told himself. He certainly had a skewed mind—skewed? It was a positive helix—but the Fat Man wasn’t just another target in some mansion somewhere. It was reasonable to assume that people had tried to trap him before."
B000W5MIGC1,B000W5MIGC,"“As quickly as that? ”

“ Yes, sir. ”

“Ye gods! ”

“ Well, sir, you know we are encouraged to consider hypothetical problems…? ”

“ Oh, yes. A very valuable exercise—” Downey stopped, and then looked shocked.

“ You mean you have actually devoted time to considering how to inhume the Hogfather? ” he said weakly. “ You’ve actually sat down and thought out how to do it? You’ve actually devoted your spare time to the problem? ”

“ Oh, yes, sir. And the Soul Cake Duck. And the Sandman. And Death. ”

Downey blinked again. “ You’ve actually sat down and considered how to— ”

“ Yes, sir. I’ve amassed quite an interesting file. In my own time, of course. ”

“ I want to be quite certain about this, Mister Teatime. You…have…applied…yourself to a study of ways of killing Death? ”

“Only as a hobby, sir. ”

“ Well, yes, hobbies, yes, I mean, I used to collect butterflies myself, ” said Downey, recalling those first moments of awakening pleasure at the use of poison and the pin, “but—”

“ Actually, sir, the basic methodology is exactly the same as it would be for a human. Opportunity, geography,"
B00G3NAPLW0,B00G3NAPLW,"As Tayte picked himself up, he grabbed a shopping bag from someone beside him and hurled it.

‘Hey!’

The bag landed short and spilled its contents, scattering several CD cases. Then Tayte was running again and he had no idea if he’d make it. He had all the man’s attention now, and as he drew closer, he could see that the mask the man was wearing was a comedy caricature of Prince Charles. It was surreal. He took in the big ears for a split second, and then all he could think about was the gun that had now turned on him. He didn’t stop. He didn’t know why, but he just kept running, thinking that although they had only just met, at least he’d bought Jean some time to get away.

The shot came instantly.

Tayte knew it had missed him when he heard a car windscreen shatter. The sound of the glass breaking startled him more than the shot itself. Ahead, Jean was on her feet, recoiling from the shove she must have given the gunman as he squeezed the trigger. Now the man was running back to the taxi, and Tayte silently thanked Jean for choosing fight over flight, if she’d really had a choice."
B00G3NAPLW1,B00G3NAPLW,"He looked back towards the restaurant as another black cab turned into the street.

Touchdown, he thought.

Being the big Washington Redskins fan he was, Tayte started to run for that touchdown now, the cool sensation on his back letting him know that he would soon be soaked to the skin if he didn’t make it. The taxi’s light was on, which was a good sign. He supposed it was making a drop-off, and he wished it would slow down so he could be there waiting for it when it did. He picked up his pace a little but soon had to slow down again. He was panting by halfway.

‘Still gotta lose a few pounds, JT,’ he told himself, having lost count of the number of times he’d said that.

The taxi stopped in the street directly outside Rules Restaurant, and when Tayte saw Marcus and Jean make a beeline for it, he smiled to himself again and thought how typical that was. If he’d wanted to impress Jean, he’d just failed miserably. He stopped running and tried to control his breathing as he walked, returning Marcus’s wave as the driver got out of the taxi.

That was when Tayte knew something was wrong."
B009NG11S20,B009NG11S2,"So who’s your favorite, sir? Composer? ”

“ All the time journalists ask me that question. I love very much Verdi and Puccini. What about you? ”

“Vivaldi. Although I love Tchaikovsky and Paganini. ”

“ What about Maestro Vincelli’s little Wolfgang? And we mustn’t forget Shostakovich and Brahms—”

“ The Concerto in D Minor!” Daniel exclaimed.

Rafael laughed heartily. “ See, you’re a lot like me; you can never choose between your heroes! What about the future, Daniel? What do you want to do? ”

“ First violin in a world-famous orchestra and play baseball on the weekends. ”

“ What? No solo career? You’re not thinking about being a concert violinist? ”

Daniel could hear the surprise in the maestro’s voice and it made him feel guilty, as if he’d disappointed the great man.

“ Sometimes. I . . . I don’t know if I’m good enough to be a soloist. ”

“ Do you know who that man is? The one who keeps badgering your poor parents? ”

Daniel glanced at the man who was still talking. He had spiky, streaked hair and dark glasses sticking out of the pocket of his jacket instead of a handkerchief."
B009NG11S21,B009NG11S2,"Then, when you get that, you explore the why, what it means. What the composer’s saying and how to put the . . . feelings in. Suddenly the music kinda”—he broke off and looked up at Rafael, who still waited patiently—“I don’t know if there’s a technical term, sir . . . sings to you. Sort of makes perfect sense. ”

The big man beamed. “ Absolutely right! And do you know why that is so, Daniel? Because it’s in two languages, first the language of the brain, all the notes in the right order and the timing and the key and so on and so on. Then second, the language of the heart. This distinction, it is what separates all musicians. Some, like the young woman who came in third tonight, Miss Funston, speak the language of the brain perfectly, and so they sound, you know, technically correct, but the heart? It is a complete mystery to them. They don’t understand the message, the pasión. When you do, it’s a revelation. Every time you go back to a score you will find something new you didn’t see before. I’m over fifty, ancient to you, I know, and I’m still a student! ”

Daniel was entranced.

B01DTSGF300,B01DTSGF30,"Although he’d never spoken to Tariq again—afraid of confirming his darkest fear and convinced that any communication would be monitored by federal authorities—he had taken the contract in Saudi Arabia, and it had proven lucrative.

He learned that having a contract begat more contracts, and he began to expand his business, branching out from simple aviation services to full-spectrum military industrialist titan. He had defense contracts encompassing everything from providing interpreters to SOCOM in Uganda to electronic perimeter security at a US consulate in Mali.

In short, he was now a player, and with that power came a duty to prevent this new leak from bringing everything down. He’d worked too long and hard, developing influence both in the halls of Congress and in the halls of the Pentagon, and in the ensuing years he’d learned to play hardball better than most. It was why he was successful.

He leaned forward and punched an intercom button, saying, “Janice, has Johan called you about being late? ”

Before she could answer, he caught a movement at the door, then recognized his head of security, Johan van Rensburg.

Dexter said, “Where the hell have you been? ”

Speaking with a light Afrikaans accent, Johan said, “ I just got in. I was delayed at JFK and had to spend the night. ”

“ I thought you were coming in two days ago. ”"
B01DTSGF301,B01DTSGF30,"I put the car in drive and tossed her my phone, saying, “You can do the honors. ”

Driving back to our row house on East Bay, I got only her side of the conversation, but from what I heard, we were headed out pretty quickly. She hung up and laid the phone down. I said, “ Well? ”

“ Well, it looks like that Panama Papers scare has surfaced again. Kurt wants us in DC today. He’s got us tickets on a flight in a couple of hours. ”

“ I thought they’d scrubbed that data and we were in the clear. ”

“ Yeah, they did, but apparently there’s an ‘Agent Zero’ out there who’s got another load he’s going to release. ”

Dexter Worthington glanced at the time once again, then went back to his computer screen, searching a news story, willing it to have additional information. He’d been doing the same series of motions every thirty seconds for the past ten minutes.

Where the hell is he?

He scanned the story for the hundredth time, and it didn’t get any less explosive. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists—a collection of networked reporters who spanned the globe—was preparing to release a second data dump of the so-called Panama Papers."
B0784MXFHD0,B0784MXFHD,"Gretel’s eyes softened now and she shrugged. “ There’s no one left, Petr. Who would we tell? ” Her look turned serious. “ And we agreed— that is, Mrs. Klahr, Hansel, and I agreed—not to involve any more police. ”

Petr was stunned at this and scoffed. “ She was killed, Gretel. No one has called the police? ”

“ I’m sure you can understand about that. ” Gretel’s eyes flamed with warning, her teeth clenched. It was a look that said anything other than total acceptance of their decision would render Petr dead to her forever.

“ Where is she? Where is the body? ”

Gretel dropped Petr’s eyes and looked to the floor. “ It’s at the bottom of the lake. ”

Petr still hadn’t heard any of the details of Anika’s death, and he quickly formed his own version of the story; he would find out later he wasn’t far off from the truth of the actual events.

He nodded. “Tomorrow at dawn. ”

Gretel nodded back and closed the door.

Chapter 3

STOOPED LOW BETWEEN a pair of twin guest beds , Anika watched Petr Stenson through the gap between the wall and open stairway that led to their basement."
B0784MXFHD1,B0784MXFHD,"There was only Hansel and my mother. No one else lived here. You know that. ”

Petr thought again of when Marlene had camped in the basement, and the smell she brought with her, a smell he was sure he could still detect remnants of now. So, in truth, someone else had lived there, but Petr decided it best not to remind Gretel of that now. “ I do know that. I’m just—”

“Get out, Petr. I need some time here by myself. There are a few things I have to find before I go. ”

“Gretel... ”

“Get out. ” Gretel didn’t yell the words, but the effect on Petr was the same as if she had.

Petr stepped past Gretel and onto the front porch. Gretel stood at the threshold with the door open halfway.

“ When is the funeral? ” he asked, having given up on trying to convince Gretel of what he’d seen. Perhaps it was a ghost, he thought, in which case she would discover it on her own soon enough.

“Tomorrow morning at dawn. It will just be the four of us. We’ll have a ceremony at the lake edge of the orchard. ”

“Just us? ”"
B01NBCJYMI0,B01NBCJYMI,"We created a system that emphasized giving everyone a voice because it makes them less likely to try and start an uprising. ” Ivan walked over to a small console and pressed his eye up to a small, glowing green spot.

“Welcome, Pseudonym. ” As a voice from the console spoke, the doors before them parted. Slowly they moved until the room beyond could be seen. Inside of it were several people milling about.

Tori took a deep breath, gathered her willpower, and took her first steps forward into the guild of villains.

Chapter 9

The large, red-carpeted lobby wasn’t quite as full as Tori had expected. She counted a half-dozen people lounging about in costumes, most either working on laptops or making small talk. Tori was about to ask Ivan for an explanation when she put the pieces together on her own: this was an emergency meeting for the council. There was no reason for a lot of the other guild members to be present. The small group made her feel a bit more at ease as Ivan continued walking forward. His aim seemed to be the large staircase at the edge of the room, though he soon veered off course as they drew closer. It appeared he was going to at least do perfunctory greetings if nothing else."
B01NBCJYMI1,B01NBCJYMI,"Around that time, you pick your group. We’re not so concerned with people having a foot in more than one pool; the main issue was making sure that everyone, no matter how unique, has someone looking out for their interests. ”

Ahead of them loomed large metal doors. Instinctively, Tori knew that beyond them was the guild, the real one, not the small selection of cells she’d seen before. This time, she felt the heat rise around her as her stomach tightened. Ivan clearly noticed but said nothing, which she was thankful for. They both knew she was working on it —pointing out her slip-ups would do no good for either of them at this point.

“ I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: for an organization of villains, you sure do have some strange policies in place,” Tori quipped, trying to keep her mind off the prospect of what lay beyond the doors.

“ And as I’ve said before, there is a reason for that. Many meta-humans become criminals because they see no other path forward. They have power, but are still suppressed by society. Eventually, they see their abilities as their only avenue toward being heard, which leads to acting out."
B00JOFW5960,B00JOFW596,"It was also a reference to Thelonious Monk, my father’s favorite musician.

There were many peculiarities to Monk’s, including some unused solar panels that were smothered in ivy, a screening room with an old film projector, a wine cellar with a dirt floor, and a small kidney-shaped swimming pool in the backyard that was rarely cleaned. Over the years it had devolved back into a murky pond, its bottom and sides covered in algae, its surface constantly filmed in rotting leaves, its unused filter clogged with the bloated corpses of mice and squirrels. At the beginning of that particular summer, I had made an attempt to clean the half-filled pool myself, pulling off the mold-blackened tarp, finding a butterfly net that worked for skimming the leaves, then filling the pool from the hose over the course of one tepid June day. I asked my parents separately if they would pick up pool chemicals the next time they went shopping. My mother’s response: “I don’t want my darling daughter swimming around in a bunch of chemicals all summer. ” My father promised to make a special trip to the store, but I watched the memory of the promise fade out of his eyes before we even finished the conversation."
B00JOFW5961,B00JOFW596,"Avoid him, Lily, I think he has leprosy. And God knows what’s in the beard. ” I don’t think it was genuine advice from my father — my mother was in earshot, and he was speaking for her benefit— but it turned out to be prophetic.

I’d spent my entire life at Monk’s House, my father’s name for the sprawling, rotting hundred-year-old Victorian mansion an hour from New York City in the deep woods of Connecticut. David Kintner—my father—was an English novelist who’d made most of his money off the film adaptation of his first and most successful book, a boarding-school sex farce that caused a brief sensation in the late 1960s. He’d come to America as a visiting writer at Shepaug University, and stayed on as an adjunct when he met Sharon Henderson, my mother, an abstract expressionist with a tenured teaching position in the school’s art department. Together, they bought Monk’s. It didn’t have a name when they purchased it, the year I was conceived, but my father, who rationalized the six bedrooms by plans to fill it with creative and intelligent (and young and female) houseguests, thought he’d like to name

it after the house that Virginia and Leonard Woolf shared."
B073RSN7Y10,B073RSN7Y1,"He had no idea.

After clearing his throat, he finally found his words. Words I was not expecting. “ While you are at school I will get you a new car. This one might be fixable, but I feel like even so, it is not reliable enough for me to feel comfortable enough with you driving it. I will be far more comfortable with you driving around something I’ve purchased for you. ”

This was undeniably kind and outrageously generous of him. I imagined him having done similar things for his own children. But I was not his child and I could not accept such a thing from him. I could not accept gifts of any kind from him. If he gave me a gift, what was to stop him from taking it back when this thing he had with my mother ended? The Bug remained in my mother’s name as far as I knew. If he got rid of it and replaced it with a new vehicle, when he kicked us to the curb later on and took the new car back we’d find ourselves homeless and without a vehicle. It would make a bad situation that much worse."
B073RSN7Y11,B073RSN7Y1,"Not only would it be rude to ignore him, it wasn’t like I had a means of escaping him.

For the eight hundredth time this morning, I desperately wished for my Bug to start. It didn’t. It had never done this before.

“Problem? ” He asked in his soft, kind voice.

Problem?

Did I have a problem?

Just one?

Was he crazy?

I had problems a plenty. Loads of them, in fact. Like his kindness, for one. Why did he have to be so nice to me? It would be much easier to move on from this place once he’d finished with my mother if I avoided forming attachments of any kind. Surely when he casts my mother out I would be right by her side when she lands on the curb.

“ It won’t start,” I mumbled not looking at him. I couldn’t look at him. If he thought he made me uncomfortable the sooner he’d be on his way.

“I will drive you in to school this morning,” he offered like I knew he would. “ I can pick you up this afternoon as well. Your mother… ” he fumbled for words and I had to fight back the bitter laughter that wanted to escape my mouth. My mother indeed."
B06XWDFRD20,B06XWDFRD2,"Wearing beige cord trousers and a tweed check waistcoat, even his clothes looked dated. Some new retro trend she’d missed out on?

‘ Mr Leyton, we have reason to believe that you were on Brewer Street, three nights ago. Can you tell us if that’s true?’ asked Jackman.

‘Most likely, Inspector. I work flexi-hours and I walk down Brewer Street to get home.’ He looked at him calmly. ‘Why? What happened?’

Marie reached into her pocket and took out a photograph of Shauna Kelly. ‘Did you see or speak to this girl, sir?’

Asher took the picture, and immediately smiled. ‘I certainly did.’ He handed back the photo. ‘ In fact, I’ve spoken to her a couple of times recently.’

Jackman’s eyes narrowed. ‘ And why would that be?’

Asher Leyton’s smile faded from his face. ‘Has something happened to her? Is that why you’re here?’

‘Do you know her by name, sir?’ asked Jackman quietly.

‘It’s something like Shona? Or Sheena? I can’t remember exactly.’ He ran long, narrow fingers nervously through his hair.

‘How do you know her, Mr Leyton?’ Jackman’s voice was getting colder by the minute.

‘I don’t know her. I’ve just talked to her on a few occasions, that’s all.’ The man almost squirmed in his chair."
B06XWDFRD21,B06XWDFRD2,"Harlan Marsh was considered the bottom of the pile when it came to postings.

He walked out into the CID room and gestured to Marie.

‘Ready!’ she called back.

‘Oh, Max, if the pathologist’s report on Shauna Kelly comes through, ring me immediately.’

Max gave a thumbs-up. ‘Will do, boss.’

* * *

Jackman had decided that they should make a swift call on Asher Leyton on their way out to Harlan Marsh. He told Marie that he didn’t want the man to get cold feet and do a runner.

Asher Leyton led Jackman and Marie down a wide hallway and into a huge open-plan lounge. It was modern, tasteful, and reeked of money. Marie noted that his fiancée was not there.

‘Lynda told me that you called, DI Jackman. I’m sorry to have caused you two trips.’ He indicated for them to take a seat on an oversized ivory leather couch, while he sat in a matching leather recliner. ‘ How can I help?’

Marie looked at him with interest. He wasn’t exactly what she had expected. Asher Leyton was in his mid to late twenties. He was of medium build, with thick wavy fair hair and had a rather old-fashioned appearance."
B0088XPHOK0,B0088XPHOK,"“ Well what would you have done if this happened in the game? ”

“Kirrum,” Cooper grunted.

“ We're not going to kill anyone,” said Tim. “ Just kick them in the head or something, and move their weapons away. ”

Julian shrugged. “ Okay. ”

“ Do we have any rope? ” asked Dave, standing again, and brushing the dirt from his knees.

“ If we do,” said Tim, “my char – “ he sighed. “ I mean I have the Rope Use skill. I can tie them up. ”

“ Did you buy any rope? ”

“ I don't think so. ”

Julian had two crossbows tucked under his left arm, and a third one in his right hand. He kicked the stirring soldier in the head, just hard enough to let him know that he should stop stirring. “ Why don't you look in the cart? ”

Tim grabbed the edge of the wagon and hoisted himself into it with a surprising amount of grace. He went deeper into the wagon, and then emerged again, dragging two bags behind him. “ Dave, Julian, I think these are yours. ”

“ How do you know? ” asked Dave."
B0088XPHOK1,B0088XPHOK,"We're inside his imagination or something. ”

“ Then where are all the girls who think his cape is sexy? ” asked Dave.

Tim and Julian chuckled in spite of their confusion and fear. Cooper snorted a laugh that shot a couple more snot wads out of his nose.

The wagon backed up a foot, pushing Dave face-first into the dirt again.

Cooper doubled over and laughed so hard, he coughed up a huge glob of brownish yellow phlegm.

“Dude,” said Tim. “ That's seriously fucking gross. What is going on with your... ” He stopped talking. A thought occurred to him. “ He can hear us. ”

“ Who? ” asked Julian.

“Mordred,” said Tim. “ He's still there in my fucking Chicken Hut, drinking my fucking Coke, and laughing his balls off at us. ” He looked up into the same patch of empty blue sky that Dave had shouted at. “ Aren't you, mother fucker? ” he shouted.

One of the two soldiers whose heads Cooper had smashed together started to stir.

“ Um... Tim? ” Julian said. “ These guys are starting to wake up. What should we do? ”

“ How should I know? ” asked Tim."
B0030CVQMG0,B0030CVQMG,"—it was only a day in your life—that’s all. Mrs. Odell says life is what we make it. Maybe you’d be happier if you adjusted your thinking a bit. ”

She looked at me with dilated eyes. “ Who’s Mrs. Odell? ”

My stomach started to churn, sending a wash of bile into my throat. I leaned my forehead against the bedpost and took in a slow breath of air. “ She’s our neighbor, Momma. She lives next door. Remember? ”

“ Our neighbor is Colonel Braxton Griffin. He’s a direct descendant of General Robert E. Lee and a fine Southern gentleman. ”

 “ No, Momma, please listen to me. There is no Colonel Griffin. Mrs. Odell has always been our neighbor. ”

 She screwed up her face and looked at me like I was the one who was nuts. I had the horrible feeling that she had, once and for all, slipped over the edge. She began rocking from side to side, tears spilling down her cheeks.

 Breathe, CeeCee. Breathe. Please, somebody help me. Please, God.

I walked to the side of the bed, sat down, and took hold of her hand. I could hardly hear my own voice when I said, “Momma. What’s my name? ”"
B0030CVQMG1,B0030CVQMG,"As I moved across her room, my heart went wild, like a bird beating its wings against a closed window. I wrapped my hands around the bedpost to steady myself. “ What’s the matter, Momma? ”

Her face turned tragic. “ Look at this,” she said, lifting her scrapbook.

The picture she wanted me to see was a photograph of her smiling like a goddess in her white pageant dress. A green silk sash was draped from one of her shoulders to the opposite hip, and the words 1951 VIDALIA ONION QUEEN were written across it in glittery script. She was standing on a skirted platform framed by two wooden barrels overflowing with onions.

 “ My life is here; this is my real life,” she whimpered, poking the picture with a stiff finger. She wiped her eyes, smearing mascara across her cheeks. “ I was so beautiful and young. ”

Knowing that compliments always made her happy, I took in a breath and said, “You’re still beautiful, Momma. ”

Her chapped lips quivered. “ You think so? ”

 I nodded and tried to think of something to say that would bring her back to reality. “ But Momma, winning that pageant wasn’t your life"
B07BF87NB20,B07BF87NB2,"Didn’t you wonder why we wanted to meet you here? ” said Finlay. “ The cops here can be bought, and for a lot less than two million. There are guys on the island I can pay to clean up the mess. Five grand, Kevin. That’s all it’ll cost to make you disappear. ” He clicked his fingers. “Poof. ”

Finlay was doing a good job, but Kevin wasn’t going to be intimidated. “ You’re bluffing. Give me the money. We both know that’s the easiest answer. ”

Finlay raised the black pistol and pointed it at Kevin’s forehead. Kevin swallowed.

Finlay turned to Jesse. “ You know, Jesse, this is like XHydron. Kevin is long and badly wrong and doesn’t know when to cut his losses. ”

He turned back to Kevin. “ For the last time – will you leave now and promise never to mention this again? Say yes or no. ”

Kevin swallowed. If he gave up now, he was lost. If he was truly going to be a greater trader than Finlay, he had to face him down now. Later on, he would look back at this moment as the most important in his life.

“ Yes or no? ”"
B07BF87NB21,B07BF87NB2,"This is a Pistole Parabellum P08. A Luger. They are ten a penny. But this one was owned by General Heinz Guderian when he led the German Blitzkrieg into France in 1940. It cost me quite a few pennies. ”

Kevin looked at it. He had control now. His cheeks were cool, his expression fixed. He could do this. Whatever stunt Finlay pulled, and it was clear he was going to pull one, he could do it.

“ It’s for killing people,” Finlay said. He looked down to the gun and then back up at Kevin. “ I’ve tried it. It works. ”

“Bullshit,” Kevin said.

Finlay slipped out the magazine, checked it, and then replaced it. Then he took a suppressor from the canvas bag and fixed it to the weapon.

“ These are hard to find and they don’t work well on Lugers. You can’t fire it semi-auto anymore. But I’ll only need one shot. And I don’t want to disturb the girls. ”

He placed the weapon on the table beside him. “ Now. Have you changed your mind? ”

“Piss off, Finlay. You’re full of it. You shoot me, the cops will be all over you. ”

B00TG2WK9C0,B00TG2WK9C,"We talked briefly at the party and she told me she had heard that Mads and Signe were having trouble and that she was going to try and make a move on him. She was very happy to see that Signe wasn't there and took it as a sign to move in on him. I told her it was probably too early, since everyone knew how much he loved Signe, but Sascha was certain it was the right time. I even saw her follow him outside as soon as the doors were opened and everyone ran out.

I stopped and looked up from my notepad. ""She did what?""

""When I got outside, I saw Mads run behind the building like he was running for his life and I saw Sascha run after him.""

24

April 2014

We thanked Bettina for her time, then drove back to Sascha's apartment and knocked on the door. She looked very surprised when she saw us.

""Did you forget something?"" she asked.

""You lied to us,"" I said. ""We talked to Bettina.""

Sascha's smile froze. Her face went red. ""Don't believe anything she says. She is a liar.""

""Don't give me that,"" I said. ""Can we come in?"""
B00TG2WK9C1,B00TG2WK9C,"Apparently, he was a kindergarten teacher and had groped and touched a lot of children in class, trying to make them believe it was natural and normal. They found tons of child-porn on his computer and, when they interviewed Signe, she talked about sex like it was an everyday thing and she wasn't a virgin anymore. Everybody in town felt so sorry for the girl.""

I felt appalled and slightly nauseated. This didn't seem to have anything to do with Maya's disappearance, but it still interested me. I had a hard time understanding these kinds of things. How you can hurt your own child like that. I missed Maya again and hoped that she was somewhere safe. A big part of me had started to wish that she had just run off and was hiding somewhere till the storm blew over, but in my heart I knew that wasn't the truth.

""So you say that Sascha was lying when she told us you were flirting with Mads Schou at the party. How do you know? Couldn't she just have seen you standing close to each other ordering a drink or something?"" Morten asked.

""No. I know she’s lying because she was the one talking to him. She was in the bar talking to him, flirting with him until the lights went out."
B010DC4K9Q0,B010DC4K9Q,"Some of the police commissioners seemed to think that was more important than his impeccable service record. If Taskinen was chosen, our unit would be in an interesting position because two people with basically identical credentials would be competing for the job: Ström and me. We both had law degrees, and while I had better grades, Ström had wider experience as a cop. The biggest obstacle to my selection would be that I would have to start my new job while on maternity leave.

I didn’t know whether I should wish Taskinen good luck with his interview or not. He would definitely be a good captain, but I couldn’t stand to have Ström as a boss.

“Is the interview report from the woman who found the body ready yet? ” I asked, my hand on the doorknob.

“ No. She hasn’t even been questioned properly. When the first patrol arrived on scene, Järvenperä was completely calm, told them what had happened, organized her groceries, and started calling a taxi. The patrol offered to take her and the kids home. When they finally got her there and she passed off the children to her husband, the shock hit. They ended up having to call an ambulance. ”"
B010DC4K9Q1,B010DC4K9Q,"Ström suggested it could also be the same guy that’s been molesting little girls around that neighborhood for the last couple of months. ”

“ Those girls were all younger than Noora, though, more like ten years old. Ström is handling that case, isn’t he? ” It was more a statement than a question. Maybe Ström could finagle Noora’s murder investigation for himself if he could convince everyone the perpetrator was the same prowler he’d been hunting. The professional competition between Ström and me was already bad enough, and I didn’t want to get into some sort of pissing contest about what case was whose.

“Ström’s case has been stalled for a while now. And I don’t think the connection is very credible, but of course we have to consider the possibility. ” Taskinen’s voice was half an octave lower than normal from the exhaustion. He yawned.

“Of course. Jyrki, shouldn’t you go get some sleep? Silja needs you at home. ”

“ No good. I have that interview with the county police commission today. ”

Now that the chief of police was retiring, a major hole was opening up in the career ladder. Taskinen was one of the strongest candidates to head up the Criminal Division, but unfortunately he wasn’t a card-carrying member of any political party."
B075LNNYV90,B075LNNYV9,"Her father said that he was going in first, and Betsy should wait. But she didn’t want to be anywhere without him; she insisted on going in. The man led them into a small room, the viewing room, and there beneath a white sheet on a stainless-steel table was the shape of someone she still didn’t believe could be Nick.

Her father stood beside the body, and Betsy stood behind him. Then he pulled down the sheet.

He blinked a lot, covered his mouth with his hand, closed his eyes.

Then Betsy looked.

There was a scratch on one side of Nick’s face and a trace of blood by his mouth, but otherwise he looked alive. Only a few hours ago he was. He looked as if at any moment he might sit up and say, “Gotcha! ” His neck was arched back, his hair mussed, his eyes closed, mouth slightly open. Her father touched Nick’s hair, the scratch, his eyelids, and then Betsy did the same, in the same order, as if it were some ritual that would bring him back. Her father took off his sweater, rolled it, and put it beneath Nick’s neck to prop up his head.

“ You’ll see him again,” her father said."
B075LNNYV91,B075LNNYV9,"She lay peacefully still in that perfect time just after waking and just before falling back asleep. The phone was ringing. She heard her father get out of bed and walk past her room, and then his voice, quiet: “No. No. No. ”

When she heard him hang up, Betsy came out of her room. Her father stood by the hallway phone, eyes closed, wearing boxer shorts, a white undershirt, black dress socks. His hair was rumpled. He looked like a boy dressed as a man, like that boyhood photo of Nick wearing their father’s undershirt. She asked what was wrong, but her father didn’t answer, he just hugged her, too long, and she started to cry even though she didn’t yet know about what.

When he told her, she didn’t believe him. He said gone, which left open the possibility of return.

Let it be Christmas Eve, Betsy thought as her father drove them to the hospital. Midnight Mass was the only reason she’d ever been up at this time, and if it were Christmas Eve then all this could be normal. But she was wearing slippers and a jacket over her nightgown. And it was October, not December. Chilly, not cold."
B017SCQKXS0,B017SCQKXS,"The sight of Bea and the baby would fell her—within seconds she would be flat on her back in bed, weeping. She had wept when Bea, at ten, came in second in the Young Ladies’ Composition for Piano Competition, wept two years later when Bea’s breasts grew to be “larger than ladylike. ” Bea had never grown immune to her mother ’s weeping. She had devised an expression, hard as a brick, that made her appear so, but inside she crumpled like a dropped puppet.

Her father wouldn’t come home until late. By then Estelle would have propped Lillian on pillows and helped make up her face. Henry would see her puffiness. He would see Bea and the infant and feel an unscheduled joy unlock beneath his ribs, but he would suppress his smile. Lillian would ask Bea the question she had been waiting for Henry’s arrival to ask. Did anyone see you walk down the street? Bea would say yes, everyone had seen, whether it was true or not, just to get the full devastation over with. Lillian would return to her weeping and Bea would go find Estelle and nurse the baby and begin living like a leper in her parents’ house."
B017SCQKXS1,B017SCQKXS,"She clung to the woman’s kindness, longed to hear her speak again. She wished there were a way to get her attention without the others seeing. Still the baby had made no noise. This could be a sign, Bea thought, that it wanted her, and no one else. Or maybe she had nursed it too well and sent it into a stupor, knowing what she was doing without admitting it to herself.

“Mum! ” A boy’s voice.

“Shh. ”

“Over here. Look! ”

“ What? ”

“Come! ”

“ What. ”

“Look! ”

“Oh. ”

“ What is it? ”

“ A baby,” the child said.

“Christ. ”

“Brand-new. ”

“ I don’t care how new it is. We’ve got work to do. ”

“ Put it over there now. ” The woman’s voice. “Over here. ” Bea could see one figure pushing another, smaller one. The taller one, the woman, had a small child on her back. “ Set it down there. Let’s finish. ”

“ What about the baby? ”

“Shh. ”

The boy left the bundle at the edge of the field, not twenty feet from where Bea hid. She fought a rising nausea. This she hadn’t considered—that they might find the baby and leave it."
B01BS7N82A0,B01BS7N82A,"Soli was no genius, but she could read a map. And so, when Manuel veered right and sped off on a junction marked for Monterrey, she sat up fast. All this time, they’d been heading west. Without warning, Manuel had turned east.

“ What do you think you’re doing? ” she asked.

“ What do you mean? ”

“ You’re going the wrong way. You’re going east. ”

“ You mind your business. ”

“ This is my business. Where are we going? ”

“ I’ve got business to take care of this way, okay? ”

“ With who? ”

He waited before answering. “ With a contact. ” His eyes slid from Soli to the road.

“ That’s not what you told my family,” she said. “ You need to get me to California. You gave your word! ”

He said nothing.

“ Get me out of here! Let me out! ” She pulled at the door handle. She beat on the window.

“ Who’s the driver? ” His roar filled the car. “ Who is the driver? ”

Soli cowered in her seat, certain he would strike her. The doors were the high-tech kind that locked while the car was moving."
B01BS7N82A1,B01BS7N82A,"She scraped at the door, as she used to when she was small and her parents would shut themselves in there some afternoons.

“Mama,” she said. “Don’t be angry. ”

From inside, she heard her mother sob. “ M’ija, get out of here. ”

“Mama! This is your last chance. ”

But she didn’t come out. Later, Soli would realize that if her mother had come out, if she had wrapped herself around her girl the way Papi had, she would never have let her go.

• • •

SOLI SPENT TWO DAYS in a car with Manuel, and the one good thing she could say about him was that he didn’t lay a finger on her. He didn’t talk much, either. When she asked him questions, he answered them and fell silent again. Mostly he hummed to the radio, American music she recognized from youth nights at the church, which she’d stopped going to because eventually she and not-all-there Torta were the only youths left. They drove first from Popocalco to a place near Oaxaca City. Soli had been to the city before, but never beyond it. After a night in Morelia with her mother’s aunt, they were meant to head up through Mazatlán, then Obregón, as Manuel had shown Papi, tracing his map with his highlighter pen."
B00OEMGIRE0,B00OEMGIRE,"I’m going to miss her. Maybe I can still hear her, touch her, and see her from heaven. She’s my heaven on Earth. She gave me the will to love again, even if it nearly broke us both. She’s my downfall too, but it was worth the pain to have the time we had. I never told her though. I never really explained how much she gave me. I’ll never have that chance now.

No .

Fuck this.

Regret is a motherfucker.

“Pulse is rising,” another voice says.

My eyes open and I see someone in my face. “Cole. Can you hear me? Get the family in here. ” I struggle to figure out what’s going on as my eyes close. “ He’s waking up. ”

Time passes and I hear a lot of movement, but I can’t focus on anything.

“Jackson, if you can hear us, open your eyes. ” I feel something press against my arm and tighten.

Drawing a deep breath I smell vanilla. She’s here. I will my eyes to open as I feel the pain again. The muscles lock in my body as I will them to obey. The light grows brighter and brighter. Fucking hell, this shit hurts."
B00OEMGIRE1,B00OEMGIRE,"Push another round of epi! ”

It hurts to breathe, so I stop trying.

The darkness returns and then the light takes over, my vision blurs. I keep my eyes closed.

I’m not ready to go … to lose everything and everyone. As much as I’d like to live with no guilt and no remorse anymore, I can’t leave them all.

So once again, I find the fight I have inside of me. The part of me I rely on when I have to find a way. I’m about to use everything I have left—if I can’t get through this black there’ll be no going back.

“Charge to 80. ”

“Clear. ”

The electric voltage travels through my body shocking each nerve alive.

“Pulse is eighty,” a female voice says.

My chest heaves as I struggle to gain control of my body.

The bright ray returns and it’s blinding. Taking all of the warmth I felt before. Now, I’m cold. There’s pain everywhere, each bone feels like it’s shattering. The fucking agony is unbearable. Maybe death is the better choice if this is the shit I’m going to go through. Although, if this is death shouldn’t there not be any goddamn pain?"
B000N2HCW40,B000N2HCW4,"Wulfhere asked.

“Nothing,” I said. I had asked the ealdorman who Odda’s bodyguard was so that I could learn the name of the man who might try to kill me, but that possible murder was none of Wulfhere’s business.

Wulfhere hesitated, wanting to ask more, then deciding he would fetch no better answer. “ When the Danes come,” he said, “you’ll be welcome to join my men. ”

Æthelwold, Alfred’s nephew, was holding my two swords and he drew Serpent-Breath from her scabbard and stared at the wispy patterns in her blade. “ If the Danes come,” he spoke to Wulfhere, “you must let me fight. ”

“ You don’t know how to fight. ”

“ Then you must teach me. ” He slid Serpent-Breath back into the scabbard. “Wessex needs a king who can fight,” he said, “instead of pray. ”

“ You should watch your tongue, lad,” Wulfhere said, “in case it gets cut out. ” He snatched the swords from Æthelwold and gave them to me. “ The Danes will come,” he said, “so join me when they do. ”

I nodded, but said nothing. When the Danes came, I thought, I planned to be with them."
B000N2HCW41,B000N2HCW4,"Violence came off the man like the stench of a wet hound and when he looked at me it was like a beast’s soulless stare, and I instinctively understood that this was the man who would kill me if Odda found a chance to commit murder. Odda was nothing, a rich man’s spoiled son, but his money gave him the means to command men who were killers. Then Odda plucked at the tall man’s sleeve and they both turned and walked away.

Father Beocca had stayed by the altar. “ Kiss it ,” he ordered me, “then lie flat. ”

I stood up instead. “ You can kiss my arse, father,” I said. I was angry, and my anger frightened Beocca who backed away.

But I had done what the king wanted. I had been penitent.

The tall man beside Odda the Younger was named Steapa. Steapa Snotor, men called him, or Steapa the Clever. “ It’s a joke,” Wulfhere told me as I ripped off the penitent’s frock and pulled on my mail coat.

“ A joke? ”

“Because he’s dumb as an ox ,” Wulfhere said. “ He’s got frog spawn instead of a brain. He’s stupid, but he’s not a stupid fighter. You didn’t see him at Cynuit? ”

“ No,” I said curtly.

“ So what’s Steapa to you? ”"
B01N2I97RN0,B01N2I97RN,"Allene was a piece of a puzzle in a plan he was still working out. No doubt he was resentful of her for snubbing him these past years, but she would make it up to him. He would make sure of that. When he’d received the invitation, he had thought of torching it in the sink, but then considered. Allene had everything he no longer did—connections and money. There were smart ways to get both without begging. Some of the most eminent physicians were friends of the Cutters—perhaps they would cross his path now. If he wanted to find Florence’s murderer and rise beyond being a janitor forever, he would need Allene.

She led him reluctantly to the large double doors. Andrew was waiting for him, looking clean worn out. “Aren’t they something? ” he murmured, watching Allene’s and Birdie’s mesmerizing feminine silhouettes recede to the drawing room.

“Mmm. ” Jasper wasn’t sure how to respond. Andrew seemed like a friendly chap, never once looking down his nose at him, unlike everyone else at the party. If things had been different, Jasper would have been the one in the tuxedo, marrying into the Cutter family. He wouldn’t have to wake up tomorrow morning on Eldridge Street and scrub urine stains off Bellevue’s tiled floors."
B01N2I97RN1,B01N2I97RN,"He looked well bred, had himself a good brain and loads of ambition — and now he had a corpse.

Alive, Florence was a snooty socialite who’d thrown snide remarks at him countless times, including last evening.

Dead, she was his salvation.

“Jasper. ” Allene was watching him as carefully as Birdie was. “ Thank you. I’ll speak to Father about all this. Right now, you need to go home. But promise to see me again. Soon. ”

Something in her expression made him pause. It wasn’t just excitement; it was the brightness and energy you see in a bird behind gilded cage wires. So pretty, so alive, but trapped all the same. He saw how Allene had reacted to Andrew’s kiss before. She could care less about that lucky bum.

Jasper donned a brilliant smile. “ Oh, I’ll see you soon. Even if you’re going to be married, doesn’t mean I can’t get my share of your time before then. Thank Florence for that. ” He leaned forward and gave her a slow kiss on the cheek. When he pulled away, he squeezed her waist. Allene was blushing. Excellent.

“ You’re a cad,” she said.

He winked. “ Of course I am. ”"
B018ER7JOU0,B018ER7JOU,"Cary doesn’t know her, but he would like to know her, her hopes and dreams and plans and fantasies. Especially the fantasies. Not in this life, he thinks. That’s mature pussy. She’s seventeen if she’s a day.

“ Aw, sugar! ” Jim Reed says, then turns to his dark-haired sib. “You go get it this time. ”

“ No way, it’ll be all spitty,” Dave Reed says. “ Hannibal, be a good dog and bring that back here! ”

Hannibal stands on the sidewalk in front of Doc’s house, still grinning. Nyah-nyah, he says without having to say anything; it’s all in the grin and the regally serene sweep of the tail. Nyah-nyah, you’ve got girls and Eddie Bauer shorts, but I got your Frisbee and I’m leaking canine spit all over it, and in my opinion that makes me the Grand Wazoo.

Cary reaches into his pocket and pulls out a bag of sunflower seeds—if you have to ride the bench, he has discovered, sunflower seeds help to pass the time. He has become quite adept at cracking them with his teeth and chewing the tasty centers even as he spits the hulls onto the cracked cement of the dugout floor with the machine-gun speed of a major leaguer."
B018ER7JOU1,B018ER7JOU,"He’s the one you ought to warn about heatstroke,” Cary says.

“ Maybe you’re right,” Peter says, and drives slowly on.

Cary watches Hannibal snatch the Frisbee off the sidewalk on the far side of the street and turn with it in his mouth. He has a jaunty bandanna tied around his neck and appears to be wearing a big old doggy grin.

“Bring it back, Hannibal! ” Jim Reed calls, and his twin brother, Dave, joins in: “Come on, Hannibal! Don’t be a dork! Fetch! Bring! ”

Hannibal stands in front of 246, across from the Wyler house, with the Frisbee in his mouth and his tail waving back and forth slowly. His grin appears to widen.

The Reed twins live at 245, a house down from Mrs. Wyler. They are standing at the edge of their lawn (one dark, one light, both tall and handsome in cut-off tee-shirts and identical Eddie Bauer shorts), staring across the street at Hannibal. Behind them are a couple of girls. One is Susi Geller from next door. Pretty but not, you know, kabam. The other, a redhead with long cheerleader legs, is a different story. Her picture could be next to kabam in the dictionary."
B07BGHGSX30,B07BGHGSX3,"”

“ So what? We’re not hurting anyone, are we? ”

“ Well, not a physical hurt, per se. More of a mental hurt. People are fighting and struggling just to have what we have, but this? This is an empty experience. Do you see? ”

“ I guess,” agreed Kenner, not truly understanding. “ Does that mean you’re going to quit the club? ”

“ I think some changes are in order,” I proposed. “ I mean, compare this room to the room at the bar. The people at that bar were having fun. I mean, really having fun. Everyone here is working. ”

“ Yeah, I can see what you’re saying now,” Kenner nodded his head. “ I think it will be tough to change things. ”

“ No change is ever easy, my friend,” I smiled.

“Gentlemen! Please welcome to the stage, Claire McCoin, from right here in the city! ”

My jaw dropped.

Claire had somehow managed to get ready, look absolutely gorgeous and leave the bar behind. I had to win this bid.

“Fifty thousand dollars! ” I shouted with my hand shooting into the air.

The room went silent. I may have overdone it."
B07BGHGSX31,B07BGHGSX3,"Li was a lithe Asian goddess. She was striking, but again I saw the clench. I felt like I was waking up from a bad dream. Here I was, standing in judgment of these women, bidding on them like slaves at an auction or something. It was barbaric. How could I have been so blind?

“All right! Gentlemen, put your hands together for Sheri from Chicago! ”

Sheri was a red head with enormous breasts. The bids skyrocketed, but I felt sick.

“ Are you okay? ” asked Kenner, concerned with a hand on my shoulder.

“I’m rethinking many things today,” I sighed. “ Travis may have a point. ”

“ Oh, I think he’s making too big a deal, ” dismissed Kenner. “ At least it’s something different for the club to do. How many times can you listen to techno music and get drunk? ”

“ That isn’t the point,” I said as the announcer introduced more women. “ These women are like Travis. They’re trying to gain entry into high society. They weren’t born into it; they’ve had to work at it. ”

“ Because they weren’t born with money, you’re saying. ”

“Precisely. That makes us elitist."
B01N6FV9610,B01N6FV961,"If this is how people will remember her, it has to tell the real story of who Jordan was. Especially since. …”

She could not finish her sentence. Especially since the cause of death was suicide. Her mother couldn’t bear to let a stranger poke around in Jordan’s life and stumble across whatever it was that made living unbearable enough to leave the world in that way. I understood. I understood better than anyone. And of course, Mrs. James knew I would.

“ Your grandfather— ” she started to say.

“ My granddad taught me many things,” I said quietly, “but his craft wasn’t one of them. ” This was a lie. My grandpa taught me everything he knew about obituary writing.

“ Please,” she said.

My mind flashed back to Mrs. James making Jordan and me pitchers of lemonade to sell on the corner, Mr. James raking up enormous leaf piles and letting us jump in, joking he was going to lock us in the house until we were thirty whenever the slightly older Dunn boys from next door asked if they could jump too. I remembered that Jordan was an only child, just like me. I allowed myself to imagine how my parents would feel if they lost me."
B01N6FV9611,B01N6FV961,"Subsequent runs featured goodbye tributes to velour tracksuits, Crocs ’n socks, Snuggies, and mystery-meat Taco Tuesdays.

Mrs. James took a breath to compose herself and said, “Do you think maybe you could help me write her obituary? ”

“ Oh, um,” I stammered awkwardly. I couldn’t possibly help with Jordan’s obit. For starters, I didn’t even know her anymore. And secondly, I wasn’t a professional writer. I’d switched majors from journalism to English after Granddaddy died. I vowed never to write obituaries—or anything else for a newspaper again—after I’d written my infamous op-ed piece on Granddaddy’s death.

“ Please, Riley? ” Mrs. James pleaded. Her voice, so full of sadness and loss, crept inside my chest and tugged at me from within. “ I just can’t do it myself. Just the thought of sitting down to write those words. ”

“ Wouldn’t you rather have someone at the Times do it? ”

“ No. ” Her tone left no room for argument. “ It has to be written by someone who knew the real her. I know you two weren’t close recently, but you knew her. Really knew her. If this is to be her last— ” She stopped herself, gathering strength to speak the next words. “"
B003NX76800,B003NX7680,"Did you really think that I would prefer to apprentice when I could attend a college? Did you really think I wasn’t at the end of my choices? ” She was pinning and unpinning her hair, the curls disobedient, refusing to be locked in place.

Laughter echoed from the upstairs, where Amelia had gone to supervise, having already taken graceful leave of Blevens in the hallway. Jenny and Thomas were closeted away in the parlor, lovers with shortened time. Christian had gone out again after shaking Blevens’s hand.

“ I’ll say good night,” Blevens said, bowing.

The front door swung shut behind him, sounding like the end of something. Outside, the rain had not let up, and he remembered too late that his horse and carriage had been quartered in the carriage house in the alley behind. He should have exited from the kitchen, where the door led to the yard and alleyway. For a moment, he paused on the stoop, but then hunched his shoulders and walked down the windswept, rainy block, turned right, and turned again into the alley, where he located the Sutter carriage house and led his horse and carriage from the warm confines into the dreary night."
B003NX76801,B003NX7680,"While everything was made right, Dr. Blevens scooped up the baby and retreated to the window, where he bounced the child in his arms. Then Mary led Blevens to the kitchen so he could wash his hands. His frock coat was edged in blood.

Mary said, “You know far more than you let on this afternoon, Dr. Blevens. Did you even need my help in the delivery? ”

The maids scurried out, pretending not to pay attention. Later, this conversation would be told in the kitchens on Arbor Hill in the Sixth Ward: And then the doctor said. And then the Miss said. Outside, the pigs would be rooting in the garbage and the maids would be saying to their husbands, “ And her so haughty. ”

Blevens said, “I don’t practice enough to feel successful in deliveries, but I am not completely ignorant of the needs of women. Bonnie’s hemorrhage was easily controlled, merely atony of the uterus. You would have done the same. ”

She could barely contain her humiliation. She would not have done the same, and the failure of her usual unerring intuition made her furious. She would have hunted for the tear, wasting precious time. “ Why do you think I knocked at your door today, Dr. Blevens?"
B00B5KQNZU0,B00B5KQNZU,"With precious moments wasting before daylight came upon him, Benfu made a choice. He had to drink. He only prayed the old pump would not moan and carry on, waking the family inside. With his ribs now in such intense pain he could barely walk, Benfu struggled over to the pump. He slowly and carefully lifted the handle and flinched when the old pipes began to rumble. Carefully he dropped to his knees. He’d be quick, just one drink. Turning his head to the side to catch the stream in his mouth, he heard someone behind him.

The quick movement to see who had caught him made his head spin and a wave of dizziness completely overtook him. As everything went black around him, he focused on the face of a girl about his own age. His last thoughts before he hit the ground were of how pretty and clean she looked as she stood there with her hands on her hips, a scolding frown making its way across her heart-shaped mouth.

Then all was dark and Benfu welcomed the curtain that fell across his vision and smothered the smell of his fear.

“ If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly, our whole lives would change. ”"
B00B5KQNZU1,B00B5KQNZU,"I appreciate what you are trying to do for me but if they find out it was you, there will be nothing that can save you. Thank you, but I can’t have that on my conscience. You’re just a boy! ”

Pei began stubbornly pushing him toward the door, ignoring his whispered protests.

“You will go and don’t worry about me. I’m older than I look and I’m fast and smart — they’ll never know who it was. I need to do this for you, Benfu. I’ve heard them beating you and stood in the shadows like a coward. You’ve already repaid me in ways I cannot say. Just go. Please, I beg you to just go! ” With that he pushed Benfu harder than expected for such a small fellow and Benfu stumbled out of the shed. He looked around and, seeing no one, bent over and ran toward the first cornfield. At the edge he turned to see the boy one last time but he was already gone. Benfu wished he had thanked him for such a selfless act but now it was too late. He turned and ran.

Benfu watched from the safety of the cornstalks for a moment, then made a dash around the old shed and behind the kitchen building to the old well."
B008K556BK0,B008K556BK,"He felt he had to contribute something to the campfire spirit of this present adventure, but the only good stories he knew were Great Expectations and David Copperfield. Dr. Larch had let him take the copy of Great Expectations with him; it was Homer’s favorite of the two. Homer asked the Winkles if he could read them a little of his favorite story. Of course, they said, they’d love it; they’d never been read to, not that they could remember. Homer was a little nervous; as many times as he’d read Great Expectations, he’d never read aloud to an audience before.

But he was wonderful! He even mastered what he guessed was Joe Gargery’s accent, and by the time he got to the part where Mr. Wopsle cries out, “ ‘No!’ with the feeble malice of a tired man,” Homer sensed he had found the proper voice for the whole tale— he felt he might also have discovered his first talent. Unfortunately, talented though he was, his reading put the Winkles fast asleep. Homer kept reading by himself, through the end of Chapter 7. Maybe it’s not my reading , Homer thought; maybe it’s the Winkles— all her sit-ups, all his trout-catching, all the fierce rigor of the indisputably great outdoors."
B008K556BK1,B008K556BK,"Grant told about the sixty-year-old lawyer who had hired them to show him a bear giving birth. Billy showed Homer her bear scars. And then there was the man who had asked the Winkles to cast him adrift at sea in a small boat—with only one oar. This man had been interested in the sensation of survival. He wanted to see if he could find his way back to land, but he wanted the Winkles to observe him and rescue him if he was getting into real trouble. The trick to that was not letting the man know he was being observed. At night—when the fool fell asleep and drifted farther out to sea—the Winkles would cautiously tow him toward shore. But in the morning—once, even within sight of land—the man always found a way to get lost again. They finally had to rescue him when they caught him drinking salt water; he’d been so disappointed, he gave them several bad checks before he finally paid his adventure fee.

“Adventure fee ” was Billy’s name for it.

Homer thought it might make his would-be adoptive parents self-conscious if he told them any stories about life at St. Cloud’s —or worse, about Thanksgiving in Waterville."

“I . . . don’t remember. I can read,” he quickly added. “ I went to the fifth grade. But it’s been so many years since I read a word I’d have trouble, I ’magine. ”

“ I understand that there is talk already of an expedition to chart a route from St. Louis to San Francisco, although I’m sure it will be several years before that happens. Can you just imagine that? A railroad from St. Louis westward all the way across the nation? It’s mind-boggling. Preacher, the government will be looking for men like you to lead those scouting parties. Men like you who know the wilderness that so many of us have only read about. Ignorant, Preacher? No, you’re far from being that. You’ve been to California? ”

“ Oh, yeah. I seen the blue waters a couple of times. I been to California and Oregon. Hard, mean trip from here. A railroad? That’s impossible! You can’t build no damn railroad through these mountains. ” He again shook his head. “ That’s a pipedream, Melody. It ain’t possible. You can’t hardly get a wagon through. You can’t even do that in most spots. ”"
B078LM1LQF1,B078LM1LQF,"” The last was spoken with some bitterness.

Melody smiled at him across the flames. “ It has to be, Preacher. The nation is growing. People want to build new lives, to explore, to expand. Do you know about the steam locomotives? ”

“ The what? ”

“ Locomotives that run by steam. It’s true. We’ve had them for almost six years now. Soon the railroads will be running everywhere. ”

“Not out here! ”

“ Oh, yes, Preacher. Even out here. A true visionary by the name of Doctor Hartwell Carver is proposing a transcontinental route. ”

“ A trans-what? ”

“Coast to coast railroad tracks. You wait and see. It will happen. ”

“Stars and garters! I never heard of such a thing. Why, I had a man tell me that no more’n five or six years ago, they wasn’t but a hundred miles of track in the whole United States. ”

“ That’s true. But I assure you, there are many, many more miles of track than that now. ”

Preacher shook his head. “Makes a poor man like me feel plumb ignorant. ”

She smiled. “ No, Preacher. Never ignorant. You’ve just been isolated, that’s all."
B07BKPBDQG0,B07BKPBDQG,"The deputy tapped his pen onto the notepad, staring at Sarah for a long time, and then finally stood. “ All right, Ms. Pembrooke. I’m going to head over to the Bell house now and have a conversation with the family and question the groundskeeper. In the meantime I have a deputy outside and down the hall to keep an eye on you. I’ll also put an inquiry into,” he returned to his notes, “Brent Alvarez. ” He closed the notebook and placed it inside his jacket. “ See if what he has to say matches up with your story about him. ”

Sarah nodded, knowing that her ex would deny whatever allegations she said about him.

“ You just get some rest. ” The deputy smiled, and then left.

Sarah exhaled relief once he was gone, and waited until the sound of his footsteps faded and there was only the slow cadence of beeps from the machines monitoring her vitals.

Sarah flung the sheets off her, climbed off the bed, and rolled the machines toward the table and her backpack. Her hospital gown flowed behind her as she opened her backpack and removed her clothes, planning to dress quickly."

“ That’s what he told me. ” Sarah ended her assault on the corner of the bedsheet and started to pick the chipped turquoise nail polish on her finger. Her hands had been wrapped with gauze, injuries from her escape out of the house, the details of which she embellished to the deputy.

“ So you woke up in the basement, broke out of the room, had the sense of mind to grab your backpack ,” he looked to the bag on the table by the door, then returned to his notes, “and then ran out of the house, escaping through a second-story window. ” Dell removed his gaze from the notepad and looked at Sarah. “ Am I missing anything? ”

Sarah shook her head, knowing full well that there was more to the story. She had avoided telling him about the body and the ghost because she knew divulging that information would only lengthen their chat and make it harder for her to leave."

Dear Dad

Okay, okay, I won’t get the tattoo. How did you know about it, anyway? Mom swears she hasn’t spoken to you in years so I don’t know where you’re getting your intel from. ‘ Intel’ means intelligence, as in information. I learnt it from the TV. I’ve been watching a lot of TV lately because what else am I supposed to do when I’m suspended from school? Mom has forbidden me from seeing Vince. I think everyone is overreacting. (Although I am glad that Mom is off the couch and in the land of the living again, even if it is just to shout at me).

Thank God that I’ll be 16 soon."

Sincerely,

Your Father

Dear Dad

I can’t believe Mom told you about the smoking! It was just once, and getting caught was just bad luck. It’s not like I’m addicted or anything. The teacher that suspended me has never liked me and was SO happy to catch me doing something wrong. It didn’t mean anything. I was just doing it to get back at Murray. He and S-J go around like life is so bloody wonderful (when it’s NOT) and so when Vince asked me if I wanted to go share a cigarette with him in the boys’ locker room (Vince always wears black and he listens to cool music and talks about deep stuff that I don’t understand) of course I said YES.

Please don’t be cross with me. Everyone else is cross enough.

Love from Em

Dear Emily

At least you spelt ‘bloody’ correctly.

Smith (he was talking about us, not about you) says that saints are just sinners who keep trying. I think it’s true. So I’ll keep trying, and you must, too.

One cigarette is not the end of the world. It’s the boy you should be cautious of."
B00VE3L8TE0,B00VE3L8TE,"After Meals sung out loud, each table competing with the other to show how much ruach they had. Given the materialism in which most of the overindulged chanichim were drowning in 1990s America, ruach, spirit, spirituality, was at the root of all the camp wished to instill.

Their success was mixed.

The boys spoke Hebrew and joined prayer quorums but wore Izod shirts with collars turned up, their hair stiff with gel, while the girls willingly made challah bread and crocheted skullcaps but also spritzed on Sun-In to lighten their hair and were slavishly addicted to Birkenstock sandals, Dr. Martens, and skorts.

Although Daniella didn’t know it, she was very beautiful that summer, her lithe young body as graceful as a dancer ’s as her strong, rhythmic strokes lifted her blond head and white shoulders out of the water.

The boys noticed. All of them. To this, she was not oblivious. Still, while she thought constantly and surreptitiously about the opposite sex, her upbringing and schooling had reinforced her shyness, making it impossible for her even to daydream about a boy outside the context of marriage.

Unlike most of her girlfriends, she didn’t want to “catch” an Orthodox doctor, lawyer, or engineer. Born into a wealthy family, money had never really been important to Daniella."
B00VE3L8TE1,B00VE3L8TE,"But for most campers’ parents, the real incentive to part with the hefty camp fees each summer was something else entirely: the hope that their children would be inoculated with enough Jewish identity to give them immunity from the lure of a shagetz or a shiksa.

When the camp offered Daniella the job, her mother—who felt it only fair Daniella earn back a tiny bit of what had been spent on her over the years —insisted she take it. Even though it was her last summer before college, Daniella, whose hopes of traveling to Israel and Europe with friends had been dashed by her family’s sudden financial straits, whether real or imagined, reluctantly agreed. “College tuition is bad enough, now especially with your father out of work…,” her mother moaned dramatically.

But it was just her mother trying to make a point, Daniella knew. As owners of a chain of jewelry stores founded by her great-grandfather, Daniella came from a wealthy family. “ That’s Grandma’s money , not ours,” her mother would shout whenever the topic came up. But her mother ran the main store and was well paid. Besides, Daniella couldn’t see that her mother had economized on her own spending, trading in a practically new car for an even newer one.

Still, she didn’t complain."

My mother reaches for a pen she’s tucked into her ponytail (she always wears a ponytail, because she knows how I feel about loose hair swishing around her shoulders) and begins to scrawl a response. “Jacob,” she says, “be a sweetheart and clear the table for me, will you? ”

And off goes my mother, champion of the confused, doyenne of the dense. Saving the world one letter at a time. I wonder what all those devoted readers would think if they knew that the real Auntie Em had one son who was practically a sociopath and another one who was socially impractical.

I’d like a friend with benefits, although I’d never admit that to my mother.

I’d like a friend, period.

For my birthday last year my mother bought me the most incredible gift ever: a police scanner radio. It operates by receiving frequencies that regular radios cannot—ones assigned by the federal government in the VHF and UHF range above the FM stations, and which are used by police, fire, and rescue crews."
B0035G08QM1,B0035G08QM,"It’s a saying,” he mutters.

“ A saying that means what, exactly? ”

Theo’s face turns bright red. “ Just Google it. ”

“Just tell me. ”

“ It’s when a guy and a girl who aren’t going out hook up, all right? ”

My mother considers this. “ You mean like . . . have sex? ”

“ Among other things . . . ”

“ And then what happens? ”

“ I don’t know! ” Theo says. “ They go back to ignoring each other, I guess. ”

My mother’s jaw drops. “ That is the most demeaning thing I’ve ever heard. This poor girl shouldn’t just tell that guy to go jump in a lake, she ought to slash all four of his car tires, and—” Suddenly she pins her gaze on Theo. “ You haven’t treated a girl like that, have you? ”

Theo rolls his eyes. “ Can’t you be like other mothers and just ask me if I’m smoking weed? ”

“Are you smoking weed? ” she says.

“ No!”

“ Do you have friends with benefits? ”

Theo pushes back from the table and stands up in one smooth move. “ Yeah. I have thousands."

His hand falls between them, he shifts, and…

“ Oh, my God,” Allison whispers loudly right next to my ear. “ They’re fucking. ”

Sure enough, his ass thrusts forward and it’s obvious that guy is banging that chick right against the wall.

“ And you’re surprised? ” I ask Allison, unable to look away from the sight.

“ Who is that? ” she asks. “ I can’t see his face. ”

I shrug. I think it’s Leon Downs, but I’m not sure either. And honestly, I really don’t want to know because I have to face these players and the last thing I want to do is have a mental image of one of them fucking in the club.

Not that I haven’t seen it before.

Oh, sure, not all players are horn dogs. If someone claims they’re all like this, it’s a classic case of stereotyping. Football players are people, too."
B072DZQT571,B072DZQT57,"Oh, Sugar Tits,” Allison continues, once again imitating a male voice, “I want to bend you over the hood of my fancy sports car and bang your brains out. You don’t mind if I don’t look at your face, do you? ” She switches voices again. “ You have a fancy sports car? Oh, well, in that case, no, I don’t mind. Not at all. So, yes, please. I’d like that. I don’t even know your name, but …yes, yes, yes! ”

 “ She’s far too young for him,” I say casually. Not that I really care, but come on. There has to be at least a ten-, maybe twelve-year age gap there. Or more. I don’t recall off the top of my head how old the man is.

Allison rolls her eyes. “ She doesn’t care. His dick could be all shriveled up as long as he has a big…wallet. ”

Once again, I’m laughing as I sip my wine and watch from our table, safely positioned in the VIP section above the dance floor.

“Ooh, did you see that? ” Allison nudges me. “ What did he say? Her eyes got all big and she backed up. You think he turned her down? ”"
B079427PN40,B079427PN4,"You want to help your sister? ”

“Of course! ”

He stopped walking and turned to face her straight-on. “ Then stay out of my way. I know what I’m doing here, and you’re just an excited kid who’s gonna get in the way. If you want to see your sister again, you’ll do as I say. ”

She blanched. Cyrus didn’t stay to see what she would do next. He’d spotted three horses in the distance, grazing together at the foot of a hill. Slowing down his walk, he debated the best direction to approach them from. If they were still anxious over the gunshots, one wrong move could send them running.

“ How do I know you have the necessary experience? ” The girl’s voice shook with emotion. “ I have only just met you. ”

Cyrus ground his teeth together. “ Can you stop yammering for one minute? ” he harshly whispered. “ The horses are right over there, and you’re liable to scare them away. ”

“ Oh. ”

They stayed still, watching the horses for a long moment. Deciding trickery was the best game, Cyrus yanked a tuft of long, green grass from the earth and approached the horses."
B079427PN41,B079427PN4,"Now you go on inside the train. Some of the ladies will take care of you. ”

Cyrus stepped forward, but the girl blocked him again. “ She’s only seventeen. I need to come with you. ”

Despite the serious moment, a guffaw burst from Cyrus. “ No,” he sharply answered.

He took another step, and again she blocked him. She was so small he could pick her up and set her to the side with one hand if he wanted to. But, he knew the trouble that could come with putting his hands on a woman. Especially, in that kind of way.

“I can ride. ”

“ Do you see any horses? ” Cyrus barked. He’d had enough with her. She was wasting precious time. Stepping around her, he stalked in the direction his thoroughbred had gone. If he got lucky, all the horses would be congregating together.

Her footsteps hit the ground close behind him. “ I know some got away. I will help you find them. If there are any left, then—”

Cyrus glared at her as she walked next to him. Normally it was hard to give that kind of beauty a sour eye, but her petulance made it easier.

B07BHYTNFD0,B07BHYTNFD,"One of the green one’s furred hands shot out, grabbing his lighter green comrade by the scruff of their neck. “ Don’t stand right underneath it you imbecile. What if his blood is poisoned? ”

“Let me down! ” Cal bellowed. The pack of werejaguars sprang a couple yards back.

“ It speaks Common Tongue,” one of the other green ones growled. “ Only orc captains are able to speak it. ”

“ He must have been coming back to claim the corpse of the one from the last moon,” the gold one said.

“… Or he’s here for reconnaissance and the rest of his pack is waiting outside the forest. ” The blue one crossed his arms, his tail swishing about.

“ Let’s take it back to Elder Keizen. ” The green one that had its scruff yanked suggested.

The blue one gripped its spear and it came alight with fire. “ I say we kill him, scout around the edge of the forest and wipe out the rest of the horde. ”

Ugh my head. It could have been the blood loss, the swaying of the net or the bickering of the werejaguars, but a headache suddenly gripped his brain."
B07BHYTNFD1,B07BHYTNFD,"All Cal could hear were the murmurings of the trees as they watched him curiously.

Cal perked up. It wasn’t just the trees that were watching him. He glanced over his shoulder. He was about as deep into the forest as the last–

“Earth Wall. ” Cal saw the ruby cat eyes glowing to his right followed by flaming javelins flying straight for him. “Argh! ” three crunched through his earthen barrier, piercing his ribs, shoulder and hip.

-7 Damage!

-10 Damage!

-12 Damage!

You are Burned! x1.5 damage by fire attacks!

Cal stumbled to his feet, running deeper into the forest. Gotta get away from these cats. Ignoring the blood dribbling down his side, he drew his hatchet. Hadn’t a fireball crashed through here the last time?

Cal tripped. Shutting his eyes, he waited for the taste of dirt and dead leaves. It never came; he found himself being hoisted up. “ No! ” He reached through the net as his hatchet thudded into the forest floor. He twisted around, trying to get a better look at the five werejaguars staring up at him. Two of them blended into the green, leafy trees around them. The remaining three were blue, dusky-gold and grey-white."

“Won’t matter. Nobody is going to shoot someone delivering a corpse. ”

* * *

Dr. Roshan Singh was a large dark-skinned man with thick dark hair and wide, nearly pitch-black eyes. He came out of the operating room fifteen minutes after Pete had arrived and met her in the empty waiting room.

Seeing the look on his face, Pete was instantly more frightened than she’d ever been in her life.

“ You are Mrs. McGarvey? ” he asked, his voice deep from his chest.

“ Yes. How is he? ”

“ May I be frank with you, Mrs. McGarvey? ”

“Please. ”

“ He seems like a tough fellow, and he should survive if he makes it through the night. He’s stable, but there are complications, not the least of which are his burns, which are susceptible to infection. But there is likely brain trauma.

The light at Palmer Ranch was red but she blew through it, angry drivers slamming on their brakes and honking their horns.

“ There’s another wrinkle coming your way, ” Otto said. “ Five minutes ago the AP said that it had unconfirmed but reliable reports that the former director of the CIA had been assassinated in a car bomb attack. The media will be all over the place by the time you get there. ”

“ My God, it’s not true, is it? ”

“ He’s in bad shape, but no,” Otto said. “ But obviously it was no accident. ”

“ Someone is gunning for him, it’s happened before. Maybe we should call the Bureau in Tampa for some help. ”

“ I want to make them think that they’ve succeeded. ”

“That he’s dead? ”

“ Yes. ”

“Soon as an ambulance shows up to take him to the airport, they’ll know. ”

“ I’m sending a hearse,” Otto said. “ It’ll be up to you to convince the hospital to confirm his death. It’s a matter of national emergency. Doesn’t matter what you tell them, just do it! ”"

The man looked to be one of the merchant’s guards. He wore a stained leather jerkin and had a bushy black beard that was in serious need of a comb. His eyes were glazed over from too much ale and he reeked of stale sweat. He was a monster of a man, nearly as wide as Ben was tall. His arms were like tree trunks sprouting out of the wood table.

Meghan stared in shock but managed to reply, “ No thank you, sir. We are fine. ”

“ Ah, lass, ‘fraid that wasn’t meant to be a question,” rumbled the man. “ It’s been a long trip all over half of Alcott and this place don’t even have a proper whore. But don’t you worry. The boys and I will pay you good copper and you might even enjoy it.

Ben realized that, just like him, she was excited about the possibilities of a life outside of Farview. She may have agreed to this deal to save Brandon’s life, but Lady Towaal did not need to force her. She wanted to go and she wanted to do this thing. He sat in silence, contemplating how this girl who was like his sister was going to change into something that he had thought only existed in stories.

The words pursued Dr. Juvenal Urbino on the drive home: “this death trap of the poor. ” It was not a gratuitous description. For the city, his city, stood unchanging on the edge of time: the same burning dry city of his nocturnal terrors and the solitary pleasures of puberty, where flowers rusted and salt corroded, where nothing had happened for four centuries except a slow aging among withered laurels and putrefying swamps. In winter sudden devastating downpours flooded the latrines and turned the streets into sickening bogs. In summer an invisible dust as harsh as red-hot chalk was blown into even the best-protected corners of the imagination by mad winds that took the roofs off the houses and carried away children through the air. On Saturdays the poor mulattoes, along with all their domestic animals and kitchen utensils, tumultuously abandoned their hovels of cardboard and tin on the edges of the swamps and in jubilant assault took over the rocky beaches of the colonial district."

She had returned home a little after midnight. She lay down fully dressed on her bed, to smoke one cigarette after another and give him time to finish what she knew was a long and difficult letter, and a little before three o’clock, when the dogs began to howl, she put the water for coffee on the stove, dressed in full mourning, and cut the first rose of dawn in the patio. Dr. Urbino already realized how completely he would repudiate the memory of that irredeemable woman, and he thought he knew why: only a person without principles could be so complaisant toward grief.

And for the remainder of the visit she gave him even more justification. She would not go to the funeral, for that is what she had promised her lover, although Dr. Urbino thought he had read just the opposite in one of the paragraphs of the letter. She would not shed a tear, she would not waste the rest of her years simmering in the maggot broth of memory, she would not bury herself alive inside these four walls to sew her shroud, as native widows were expected to do."
B01E1RRX660,B01E1RRX66,"Lincoln was Helen’s son and if betrothal contracts were still in place, my mother would have had us engaged from birth. Ever since I’d returned to England, she had been doing everything in her power to throw us together. I suppose she thought if she pretended that I’d already accepted Lincoln’s invitation, I couldn’t back out.

It was on the tip of my tongue to snap a refusal, then I saw the expression on Helen’s face. Irritation warred with compassion in my heart and compassion won.

“ Oh… er … yes, that’s right … I … er … I’d forgotten,” I said. I gave Helen a wan smile. “ I’m really looking forward to it. ”

“ You know, he’s so fond of you, Gemma,” said Helen with a meaningful look.

My smile felt frozen on my face. “ Um… yes, I… I’m very fond of Lincoln too. ”

Thankfully, my mother suddenly remembered a new recipe she wanted to show Helen and the two of them disappeared into the kitchen. I took a deep breath and tried to lower my blood pressure again.

“ Besides, you’ll probably be busy getting your hair done or something for Monday night,” said Helen with a smile. “ I’m so delighted that you’re going with Lincoln to the Oxford Society of Medicine dinner, Gemma. ”

“ I … I am? ” I stared at her in surprise. It was the first I’d heard of it. I gave my mother a suspicious look.

“ Oh yes, darling, remember I told you? ” said my mother airily. “ I was chatting with Helen the other day and she told me that Lincoln is the keynote speaker at the Oxford Society of Medicine dinner this term. Isn’t that such an honour? I knew you’d want to be there. ”

Honestly, she didn’t care about first-class this and luxury that. She hadn’t known about Christian’s family’s wealth when they had first started dating. It was the little things he did that mattered, like the fact that from the very first time they went out for a drink, he had called her most days, just to see how she was, just to find out how her day was going.

“ Surely not coach? ”

“No. ”

“I’ve booked it. Business class , so it’s fine. ” It was only a small white lie, but the thought of telling Christian that she had grabbed a last-minute deal on a budget airline that left at nobody’s business of an ungodly hour would, no doubt, send him into a spin.

I was thinking about such matters when Ben Simon’s wife, Sia, came to walk beside me. She pitied me because I followed behind in the clouds of dust that had been stirred up. She was perhaps ten years older than I, with a mass of black hair set into coils. Her eyes were dark with gold flecks. She might have been beautiful had she not been the devoted wife of an assassin, worn down by fear. Assassins should not marry, I decided then, or have daughters, or allow anyone to love them.

“ Would you like to ride with my sons for a while? ” Ben Simon’s wife suggested.

I could see she was tired, and I was used to walking. I thanked her and said no, I was happy to follow. I hoped she would leave me alone.

“ I’m so glad to have you here,” she blurted. “ Leaving would be so much worse without another woman beside me. ”

Before me there was the coiling black viper of the desert that wraps itself around its prey and refuses to let go. He had devoured the lion and now had come for me. In my dream I offered the scaled beast almonds and grapes, but it had a taste for human flesh. I begged for it to release me as I mourned for the lion. I yearned for that beast in the way that a person yearns for her own destiny. What happens is already written, and the lion had been written beside my name.

“We must go and not look back,” my father said when he woke me.

If I wasn’t quick enough, my father would doubtless leave me behind. I didn’t argue, though I felt a tide of dread in that dark chamber. There was blood on the assassin’s robe, and his eyes were shining. Something had happened, but I dared not ask what it was. I rose from my pallet on the floor, ready in an instant. I gathered the belongings I had carried with me from house to house."

With a naughty grin, Max kissed me. Long and hard and so intense I felt my body flood with pleasure around his finger, and only when he was satisfied that I was a complete pile of neediness did he kiss his way slowly down my body before settling between my legs. “Just relax. And feel. ”

I could do that. At least I thought I could, it was too much when he closed his mouth around my clit, kissing and licking, French kissing me down there, my body began to short circuit. No coherent thoughts formed in my mind other than ‘Yes!’ and ‘Max.’ His tongue moved like there were three of them, flicking my clit until it was swollen and aching, sliding deep into me, fucking me with his tongue until my legs clamped tight around his head. “ Sorry,” I panted."

He stared at me for a long time and I began to squirm, feeling like a science experiment gone wrong. Just as I had, hell even before the scar. The truth is that the scar had only made me feel like more of an outsider, already deemed an other because my parents had died. “ How can that be? ”

I fell back on the bed and covered my face. “Max, I like you. Enough to sleep with you when I haven’t slept with anyone else ever, please don’t pretend with me. Not now. I couldn’t take it. ”

“Jana, look at me. ” When I didn’t, I felt the weight of his body over mine and his warm hands pulling my arm away from my face. “ You’re gorgeous and yeah you have a scar on the right side of your face, but it’s a small portion of a pretty great fucking face, okay? ” I nodded at his serious tone. “"

“ What’s wrong? Do you have something planned? Are you supposed to see someone? ”

“Nope. No plans. ” Not yesterday, not today, not tomorrow: no plans at all. “ But who is this Kano woman? And what does she want with me? I’d like to have some idea before she calls again. If it’s about a job for me connected with your brother, forget it. I don’t want to have anything to do with him. You know that. ”

“ No, it has nothing to do with a job,” she said, with a hint of annoyance. “ It’s about the cat. ”

“The cat? ”

“ Oh, sorry, I’ve got to run. Somebody’s waiting for me. I really shouldn’t have taken the time to make this call. Like I said, I haven’t even had lunch. Mind if I hang up? I’ll get back to you as soon as I’m free. ”

“ Look, I know how busy you are, but give me a break. I want to know what’s going on. What’s with the cat? Is this Kano woman—”"
B003XT605Y1,B003XT605Y,"It had come to me at the very moment when I was about to cut the sandwich in two, but now it was gone. Chewing on my sandwich, I tried hard to bring it back. But it wouldn’t come. It had returned to that dark region of my mind where it had been living until that moment.

•

I finished eating and was clearing the dishes when the phone rang again. This time I took it right away.

Again I heard a woman saying “Hello, ” but this time it was Kumiko.

“ How are you? ” she asked. “ Finished lunch? ”

“Yup. What’d you have? ”

“Nothing,” she said. “ Too busy. I’ll probably buy myself a sandwich later. What’d you have? ”

I described my sandwich.

“I see,” she said, without a hint of envy. “ Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you this morning. You’re going to get a call from a Miss Kano. ”

“ She already called,” I said. “A few minutes ago. All she did was mention our names—mine and yours and your brother’s—and hang up. Never said what she wanted. What was that all about? ”

“ She hung up? ”

“Said she’d call again. ”

“"
B015X16FGI0,B015X16FGI,"Do you think any consideration could tempt me to marry a man who would declare an engagement without my consent? Who would presumptuously demand I cooperate, regardless of my own wishes, simply because I have not at present the protection of my father to tender my refusal? ”

“Refusal? You cannot be serious! ”

She gritted her teeth and took a threatening step closer. “ I am quite serious, Mr Darcy. From our earliest acquaintance I was impressed by your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain for the feelings of others! ”

Darcy was reeling with shock. Elizabeth was… refusing him? And she thought him selfish and conceited? He stared, open mouthed, as she continued her litany against him.

“ In our every meeting, you have shown yourself to be the most ungentlemanly of men! I have long believed you to be the most prideful man of my acquaintance, and you have certainly proved it today with your callous disregard for my sentiments! You bully and you insult, and this is the behaviour of a gentleman? Yet even before today’s events, my opinion of your character was decided when I heard Mr Wickham’s tale of your dealings with him! ”"
B015X16FGI1,B015X16FGI,"He could scarcely credit her petite frame with the kind of strength she clearly possessed.

She bolted to her feet, trembling with rage. He followed, more uncertainly. “ How dare you, sir? ” she cried.

He took his hand away from his face, instinctively glancing to see if she had drawn blood. Fortunately she had not, but the insistent sting of her strike would take some time to fade. “ Pardon me? May I remind you, Miss Bennet, we are engaged! There was nothing improper! ”

“ We are most certainly not engaged, Mr Darcy! ”

“ Miss Elizabeth, please, be reasonable. I know I took liberties. I beg you would forgive me, but under the circumstances there is no call to take such offence. I might wonder why you would treat me with such incivility,” he returned, a little stiffly.

Her eyes began to fill with tears again. “ And I might wonder why you would choose to tell me you loved me against your will? Is that not some excuse? But I have other reasons to dislike you, you know I have! ”

“Reasons? What reasons? ” he demanded, his anger growing.

She took a gulp of air, fighting for composure. “"
B07BHTBTRX0,B07BHTBTRX,"” I rubbed my jaw, recalling the last time I’d buried my face in her sweet pussy. It had tasted so good, but it had been nearly 40 minutes before she started bucking her way into an orgasm.

“Huh. That happens to me too. You don’t think it’s that we’re not good at it, do you? ”

I stared at him incredulously. “ No way. Are you kidding? Dicks are just way easier to service for girls. I was just thinking that they might be less enthusiastic about head because they don’t get off on it enough, but it’s not really a fair comparison. It’s totally not us. Pussies are just complicated. ”

“ True, true. Pussies do take a little more work. ”

“ And the girls probably have all kinds of sexual inhibitions, like girls do. That probably gets in the way. ”

“ No doubt. ”

“ Well…” I held my beer out to Frank again. “ Here’s hoping this weekend is exactly what we all need to get past any stupid sexual inhibitions. ”

He clinked the rim. “Truth. ”

We continued shooting the shit and sipping on our beers until Kelsey called us back inside."
B07BHTBTRX1,B07BHTBTRX,"But she’s not nearly into sucking my cock enough. I want to see her get excited about it, ya know? Really go to town. I feel like she’s doing me a favor when she does it now. ”

I kept quiet. Maya didn’t mind blow jobs, but I got kind of the same feeling from her—and not just with blow jobs. At least Frank and I could empathize over the same problems with these girls. They didn’t understand guys and the needs we had. When I was hard and horny, wanting to do all sorts of sexy, nasty things to Maya, I wanted her to be excited about it. I wanted to feel like she was getting horny at just the sight of my cock! It would make sex so much hotter.

“ You don’t think it’s because…” I began, but then shook my head.

“ What? ”

“ Well… do you go down on Kelsey, dude? ”

He shrugged sheepishly. “ I mean, yeah. Sure. Sometimes. You go down on Maya, right? ”

I nodded. “ Of course. Usually. I just… usually I’m pretty tired after she gets me off. It just takes so damn long, and my jaw gets tired."
B00JZBB01I0,B00JZBB01I,"I don’t know,” Fat Monte said. “ But my guess is you’re gonna be in the fridge until you’re at least a couple states away. The truck is only gonna be at forty-five degrees, so it’ll be like springtime in Chicago. ”

Forty-five degrees. Sal could live with that.

Fat Monte walked Sal over to the big rig, and the two of them stood for a moment at the bottom of the loading ramp. They watched one of the uniformed guys inside the truck clear a spot. There were maybe ten blankets, a pillow, a flashlight, a couple of bottles of water, a box of Ritz Crackers, a walkie-talkie, even a chair. All the comforts of home, surrounded by boxes of ground beef. When the worker saw the two of them, he said, “ This gonna work, boss? ”

“ That’ll be fine,” Sal said.

“You start having a problem, just get on the walkie-talkie and the driver will pull over,” the worker said.

They had all the angles worked out, which made Sal think maybe this wasn’t the first time the Family had smuggled a man out of town this way, which gave him an odd bit of relief."
B00JZBB01I1,B00JZBB01I,"That’s it,” Sal said. “ There’s maybe two grand in there. Make sure there’s two grand in there when my wife gets it, too. ”

Chema bit at his bottom lip but didn’t say anything for a second. “ Your wife,” he said finally, “she like Mexican food? ”

“Not really,” Sal said.

“My girl makes these Mexican wedding cookies, maybe something like that? ”

“ Sure,” Sal said. “ If not, my son would eat them. ”

Chema bit at his lip again, and Sal couldn’t help but wonder what was going through his head.

Fat Monte opened the car door before Chema could respond.

“Neal, Chema,” Fat Monte said, “give your coats and shirts to Sal. ” Neal and Chema looked at each other once in mild surprise but did what they were told. At the same time, Fat Monte took off his jacket and handed it to Sal, too. “ Put all this shit on over your clothes. ”

“ Where am I going? ” Sal asked. He was out of the car now, layering shirts and jackets on top of his own suit jacket and button-down, the way he always dressed for a business meeting.

“"
B077YXMQDC0,B077YXMQDC,"You’re not going to say yes, are you? ”

I shrug. “ I don’t know. Maybe. ” Absolutely not, but I’m curious to see how Devin reacts.

His frown deepens. “ Why would you go out with him? I thought you didn’t like him. ”

I chew on my lip. “I don’t, not really, but some of the other girls are teasing me because I’ve never kissed a boy, so maybe I should go out with Adam, get it over and done with, and then they’ll back off. ”

Devin stiffens underneath me. “ That’s a stupid reason to go out with him, and I’m not letting you. I don’t trust him not to hurt you. ”

“ It’s not up to you. ”

Silence descends, and it’s not the comfortable type.

“ What if I kissed you? ” he whispers, and my cheeks heat again.

“ What? ” I sit up a bit straighter, looking into his eyes.

“ Just so you can get it over with and you won’t have to date the douche then. ”

My face drops, along with my heart. “ Thanks, but I don’t want to force you to do something you don’t want to do. ”"
B077YXMQDC1,B077YXMQDC,"Recently, he’s graduated from calling me princess to calling me baby doll. I’m not sure I like it any better, but I’m afraid if I tell him to stop, he won’t call me anything but my name, and I like that he has a special name for me. It makes me feel important.

I crawl over to his side, butterflies running rampant in my chest. Slipping under his arm, I instantly feel warm. He tightens his arm around me, and I snuggle in closer to his chest, closing my eyes, and savoring the touch of him against me. He pulls the blanket up under our chins. “ Better? ” he whispers, and I nod. I’m not looking at him until my cheeks have calmed down.

Some nights, I dream about this. About him holding me and kissing me and being his.

“ I heard something today, but I’m not sure I should tell you. ”

I blink my eyes open at that. “ We don’t keep secrets, so spit it out. ”

“ That douche Adam is going to ask you out. ”

“ Really? ” I’m surprised because all the douche does is tease me mercilessly.

Dev frowns. “"
B000FC128M0,B000FC128M,"Then they got the honchos down there to put into writing a policy about on-the-job harassment from the male workers. It was a year or two after EB started hiring women to work in the shipyard. ”

“You were married to a welder? ” she asked, a smirk on her face.

“ Her friend was a welder. Dessa ran the day care center. ‘Kids, Unlimited!’ it was called. Exclamation mark at the end. ”

“Fascinating,” Nedra said. Except she didn’t sound too fascinated. She was attacking that pizza like the shark in Jaws. “ My ex-husband’s a psychiatrist,” she said. “ He’s an administrator down at the state hospital. ”

I almost told her about Thomas, but didn’t want to encourage any wow-what-a-small-world connections between the two of us. Besides, she’d made that crack about my grandfather being “schizo. ” I kept hoping she’d leave before those bald tires of hers closed out leaving as one of her options. It frosted me a little that she’d just gone into my room and taken the quilt. Who knew what kind of liberties she was taking with my grandfather’s story? What else she was weeding out of that thing besides his “peasant Sicilian ”?"
B000FC128M1,B000FC128M,"I’m quitting anyways. ”

When I closed the door and turned around again, I saw my quilt draped around Nedra Frank’s shoulders. Which meant she’d been in my bedroom.

At the kitchen table, she picked off all the pepperoni slices and stacked them like poker chips, then blotted the tops of the pizzas with paper towels. We opened a second six-pack.

It must have been a Thursday night because later Cheers was on—a show Nedra said offended her politically because all the women characters were either bimbos or bitches. She’d come late to feminism, she said, after having been daddy’s little girl, then a majorette in high school, then a slave to a chauvinist husband and a Dutch colonial on Lornadale Road. “ I had to go into therapy for three years just to give myself permission to get my Ph.D.,” she said. “Take this! ” She aimed the remote control at Ted Danson, deadening the TV.

“ My wife was in Ms. magazine once,” I said. “ She and her friend Jocelyn. ”

“ You have a wife? ”

“ My ex-wife, I meant. She and this friend of hers organized day care for women welders down at Electric Boat."
B0752BSSQD0,B0752BSSQD,"God knows he didn’t have much of a male role model growing up. No, Mister McDermitt, there is absolutely zero chance that my husband stole whatever was in that post. He was a swapper. ”

“ A swapper? ”

“ This land? It’s two acres, all high ground. Higher than anything on Big Pine. And we have fresh water. This land and all the materials that went into this house, Dan bartered for. ”

“From a paperclip to a new home? ”

She laughed. “ Something like that. He’d done it all his life, trading this toy for that, a fishing reel for a bike, an old car he fixed up for a boat. In the Army, he continued his bartering. Sometimes he’d trade for something he had absolutely no use for, but knew someone who did. It drove me nuts, before we got married. He always had his eyes open for a deal. Then I learned the method to his madness, and his ultimate goal: this house and our family. ”

“ You knew him a long time? ”

B0752BSSQD1,B0752BSSQD,"The other column had no notes, but the sum at the bottom was less than the sum of the materials list. An income list? If so, Amy Huggins was sinking all she had into the house and wouldn’t have enough to finish.

“ Dan was an engineer,” she said. “ He was in South America to survey several possible locations for a new Army base. ”

“ The US doesn’t have any bases in Latin America, from any branch of the military. ”

“Plans are in the works,” she said. “ Nothing super-secret, it’s public knowledge, but you know the military. They don’t care if you find out something on your own, but they’re not gonna make a public announcement or anything. ”

“ I’m going to ask you something, ” I said, “ and I hope you won’t be upset. But is there any chance your husband had any kind of illegal dealings down there? ”

Amy smiled. “ I was hoping you’d ask that. You strike me as an ethical guy. You don’t want to be involved in anything nefarious? ”

“ I won’t be. ”

“You’d have liked Dan, and I think he’d have looked up to you."
B00RRT33EC0,B00RRT33EC,"They were in college before everyone around here lost their money, is what they say.

They won’t last, is Charmaine’s opinion. Either someone will beat them up and they’ll quit, or they’ll give up and start taking those drugs, which is another way of quitting. Or a pimp will move in on them; or one day they’ll just drop through a hole in space and no one will want to mention them, because they’ll be dead. It’s a wonder none of those things have happened yet. Charmaine wants to tell them to get out of here, but where would they go, and anyway it’s none of her business.

When they aren’t busying themselves in the Fuck Tank, they sit at the counter and drink diet sodas and chat with Charmaine. Sandi told her they only do the hooking because they’re waiting to get real work, and Veronica said, “I work my ass off,” and then they both laughed. Sandi would like to be a personal trainer, Veronica would choose nursing. They talk as if these things might really happen one day. Charmaine doesn’t contradict them, because Grandma Win always said miracles really can happen, such as Charmaine coming to stay with her – that was a miracle!"
B00RRT33EC1,B00RRT33EC,"But Stan looks at her like she’s out of her mind, and she sees that yes, it would be silly, leaving the car unattended with everything in it such as their clothes, and putting themselves at risk in addition, because who knows what might be hiding in the bushes? Anyway, where would they jog? Along the streets with the boarded-up houses? Parks are too dangerous, they’re full of addicts, everyone knows that.

“Jogging, fuck,” is all Stan says. He’s bristly and grumpy, and he could use a haircut. Maybe she can smuggle him into the bar where she works, later, with a towel and a razor, and he can give himself a wash and a shave in the men’s room. Not luxury surroundings, but at least water still comes out of the tap. It’s rusty red in colour, but it comes out.

—

PixelDust is the bar. It opened in the decade when there was a digital mini-boom here – a bunch of interactive startups and app creators – and was meant to lure in those kinds of geeky kids, with toys and games such as foosball and pool and online car racing. There are big flatscreens where they once ran silent movies as cool wallpaper, though one of them is broken and the rest show ordinary TV shows, a different one on every screen."
B01BH391QW0,B01BH391QW,"She reached forward and drew the hard-backed atlas towards her. Now how many seas would you cross to get to Russia? she pondered.

“ What's that you've got there then? ”

Eileen looked up to see her father stooping down to look at the map. She explained her conversation with Anna Muller earlier that day and how she was now counting the different seas between their own little island and the vast country from which the lady next door but one hailed.

Geoffrey nodded wisely and settled back on the sofa.

“ Russia played a big part in the war”, he explained, “Sit up here and I'll tell you all about it. ”

Eileen listened eagerly as her father recounted tales of Hitler, outlined with his finger the countries whose men had fought alongside their British allies and the harsh conditions endured by the Russian soldiers as they had marched towards the battlefront. As a patternmaker for Rolls Royce aircraft engines, Geoff's job had been deemed important to the war effort and he had been excluded from enlistment, much to Olive's relief, but Eileen could see that he was just as patriotic and informed about it as those who had fought under Winston Churchill's orders."
B01BH391QW1,B01BH391QW,"But you are still very young and have your whole life ahead of you. The world is your oyster. ”

'I suppose you're right', replied the schoolgirl, 'Did you have a good day?'

Eileen wasn't sure but she thought that she felt her new friend stiffen at the question, nothing too drastic but just a momentary arch of her shoulders. Whatever the emotion behind the sudden twinge, it was gone within seconds and a smile slowly spread across the Eastern European's bow-shaped lips.

' Yes, thank you', nodded Anna, 'I suppose I did have a good day today'.

With a short nod of the head, Mrs. Muller then turned to look out of the window, lost in her thoughts and now oblivious to the child at her side. The conversation was over.

That evening Eileen lay in front of the roaring fire, her homework books lying redundant on the rug in front of her, thoughts a million miles away. What a stylish and chic lady Mrs. Muller is, she mused, and she has such good English for a foreigner, although Eileen had never actually met a non-English person before and had nobody else to compare the elegant Russian's language skills with."
B007GBTBMY0,B007GBTBMY,"The weapon he’d selected for this task was a Remington bolt-action 700P, .338 caliber—a nice balance of accuracy and stopping power, zeroing out at three hundred yards. To this he’d affixed a digital video scope with infrared. Using the binoculars, he would isolate his target; the rifle, mounted on a bipod at the edge of the balcony, would do the rest.

On the first night, windless and lit by a waning quarter moon, Kittridge had shot seven: five on the avenue, one on the opposite roof, and one more through the window of a bank at street level. It was the last one that made him famous. The creature, or vampire, or whatever it was—the official term was “Infected Person”—had looked straight into the lens just before Kittridge put one through the sweet spot. Uploaded to YouTube, the image had traveled around the globe within hours; by morning all the major networks had picked it up. Who is this man? everyone wanted to know. Who is this fearless-crazy-suicidal man, barricaded in a Denver high-rise, making his last stand?

And so was born the sobriquet, Last Stand in Denver.

From the start he’d assumed it was just a matter of time before somebody shut him down, CIA or NSA or Homeland."

Bernard Kittridge, known to the world as “ Last Stand in Denver,” realized it was time to leave the morning the power went out.

He wondered what had taken so long. You couldn’t keep a municipal electrical grid running without people to man it, and as far as Kittridge could tell from the nineteenth floor, not a single human soul was left alive in the city of Denver.

Which was not to say he was alone."
B001NLKZLE0,B001NLKZLE,"When she had finished, she leaned toward me and licked my lips.

“ Now you do it. Undress me. Slowly. Very slowly. ”

I understood then that I had survived my sickly, unfortunate childhood just to experience that instant. I undressed her slowly, as if I were pulling petals off her skin, until all that was left on her body was the velvet ribbon round her throat and those black stockings —the memory of which could keep a poor wretch like me going for a hundred years.

“Touch me ,” she whispered in my ear. “Play with me. ”

I caressed and kissed every bit of her skin as if I wanted to memorize it forever. Chloé was in no hurry and responded to the touch of my hands and my lips with gentle moans that guided me. Then she made me lie on the bed and covered my body with hers until I felt as if every pore was on fire. I placed my hands on her back and followed the exquisite line of her spine. Her impenetrable eyes were just a few centimeters from my face, watching me. I felt as if I had to say something.

“ My name is—”

“Shhhhh. ”"
B001NLKZLE1,B001NLKZLE,"She moved like a cat, as if her body, hugged by a corset that shone like scales, were made of water and had learned to defy gravity. Her slender, endless neck was circled by a scarlet velvet ribbon from which hung an upside-down crucifix. I watched, unable to breathe, as she slowly approached, my eyes glued to those lusciously shaped legs in silk stockings that probably cost more than I earned in a year and shoes, pointed like daggers, that tied round her ankles with silk ribbons. I had never seen anything as beautiful—or as frightening.

I let that creature lead me to the bed, where I fell for her, literally, on my backside. The candlelight hugged the outline of her body. My face and my lips were level with her naked belly and without even realizing what I was doing I kissed her under her navel and stroked her skin with my cheek. By then I had forgotten who I was or where I was. She knelt down in front of me and took my right hand. Languorously, like a cat, she licked my fingers one by one and then fixed her eyes on mine and began to remove my clothes. When I tried to help her she smiled and moved my hands away.

“Shhh. ”"
B01I4FPMBO0,B01I4FPMBO,"no, it’s real, your life is about to change. At last, something surprises you.

It takes a year for the building to go up, and you watch the construction every day. Brick by brick. You can’t tell when it will be finished exactly, when you’ll finally lose the view, but you decide to throw one last party to signify the end. You invite everyone you know and you even allow children to come. Your friends toast the Empire State Building, and you. “ It was a good view,” says one of your old work friends, her fiancé in tow. “ It wasn’t a million-dollar view,” you say, “ but it was worth fifteen hundred a month. ” “ You have such a good deal,” says her fiancé. “ You can’t move, even without the view. You can never leave this apartment,” he says and shakes your shoulders.

The day the final brick is cemented and your view is officially gone, you buy a bottle of wine and order a pizza and sit at your table. You stare at air and nothing and brick. The thing that made you special is gone. You will never have that view back, nor that time."
B01I4FPMBO1,B01I4FPMBO,"” You say, “I’ve been busy,” as if you need to justify why you’re not doing drugs anymore. You don’t buy that much, just enough, but then you meet a man at the bar— you both pretend you’ve met before although you haven’t, but it just feels safer that way for some reason — and he has more than enough for the two of you. Then you go home together, to your place, to tiny Manhattan in the window, to the piles of sketchbooks, and the two of you proceed to do all the drugs. This goes on for hours. There’s a little bit of sex involved but neither one of you is that interested in each other. Drug buddies, that’s about it. You can’t even get it up to get it up. Eventually he leaves, and you turn off your phone and go to sleep. You wake up on Sunday night. You turn on your phone. There are eight messages from your brother and your mother. You have missed your niece being born.

You don’t do any drugs after that, ever again. No rehab necessary. You start to see the world with fresh eyes. But the world looks the same. Job, apartment, friends, family, view."
B00AEDDSZW0,B00AEDDSZW,"He puts it on the table next to her plate and sits down again. He often gives her presents and she loves this about him, but she loves it less when the presents are meant to placate her.

“ What’s the occasion? ” she asks.

“ No occasion. ”

There’s a smile on his face but the atmosphere is crackling. Objects should be flying across the room; heads should be spinning on their stalks. She picks up the package and finds it nearly weightless. The tape peels off easily, and from a sandwich of protective cardboard she extracts a beautiful small picture, a Rajput painting, an original. The scene, blocked out in blues and greens, portrays a woman in a long dress standing in a walled garden. Surrounded by peacocks and a gazelle, adorned with elaborate gold jewelry, she is evidently not plagued by any material worries or worldly concerns. Leafy branches arch protectively over her head, and the grass beneath her feet is a wide green carpet. They study the scene together, comment on the woman’s hennaed hands, her little white basket, her lovely figure seen through the voile of her gown. As they take in the fine detail and flat blocks of color, their life unobtrusively returns to normal."
B00AEDDSZW1,B00AEDDSZW,"She swallows a tidbit that’s only half chewed and it lodges in her throat, triggering her gag reflex. Gallantly, he leaps up and pounds her on the back as she sputters and heaves. At last, the shred of matter that caused the problem erupts into her hand. Without looking at it she places it on the edge of her plate.

“ Let me know what you decide,” she says, using her napkin to blot the corners of her eyes. “ If you go I might have the carpets cleaned. And make some marmalade. ”

She doesn’t plan on doing either of these things; it’s just something to say. She has always counted it a plus that he doesn’t lie to her, meaning that he doesn’t embroider his accounts of himself with the kind of detail that would turn them into lies. The problem here has nothing to do with his circumlocution. The problem is that he doesn’t go away for the weekend, that going away for the weekend is something he’s never done before.

“ Hey,” he says. “ I got you a present. ”

He leaves the room and comes back with a package—a flat rectangle roughly the size of a paperback book, wrapped in brown paper and secured with masking tape."
B0064CL1T20,B0064CL1T2,"Her eyes asked a question.

“Being over there changes a man. Right and wrong don’t look so different any more to some. ” He turned to go, but put his head back through the doorway. “ You’ve got every right to have him up on charges if you want. But I reckon he’s probably got enough troubles. Like I said—up to you, ” and he disappeared through the door.

CHAPTER 2

Point Partageuse got its name from French explorers who mapped the cape that jutted from the south-western corner of the Australian continent well before the British dash to colonize the west began in 1826. Since then, settlers had trickled north from Albany and south from the Swan River Colony, laying claim to the virgin forests in the hundreds of miles between. Cathedral-high trees were felled with handsaws to create grazing pasture; scrawny roads were hewn inch by stubborn inch by pale-skinned fellows with teams of shire horses, as this land, which had never before been scarred by man, was excoriated and burned, mapped and measured and meted out to those willing to try their luck in a hemisphere which might bring them desperation, death, or fortune beyond their dreams."
B0064CL1T21,B0064CL1T2,"Yes, sir! ” He turned to the woman. “ Beg your pardon, Miss. Didn’t mean any harm. ”

Still terrified, the woman gave the slightest nod.

“Now, out! ” Tom said, and the man, deflated by sudden sobriety, shuffled from the cabin.

“ You all right? ” Tom asked the woman.

“ I — I think so. ”

“ Did he hurt you? ”

“ He didn’t… ”—she was saying it to herself as much as to him—“he didn’t actually touch me. ”

He took in the woman’s face— her gray eyes seemed calmer now. Her dark hair was loose, in waves down to her arms, and her fists still gathered her nightgown to her neck. Tom reached for her dressing gown from a hook on the wall and draped it over her shoulders.

“ Thank you,” she said.

“Must have got an awful fright. I’m afraid some of us aren’t used to civilized company these days. ”

She didn’t speak.

“ You won’t get any more trouble from him. ” He righted a chair that had been overturned in the encounter. “ Up to you whether you report him, Miss. I’d say he’s not the full quid now. ”"
B0755V6H320,B0755V6H32,"You hate me. Ask Jackman to help you, not me.

‘. . . and I can’t expect you to know how I feel. My niece is the child of the sister I lost last year, and I’ve rather taken her under my wing.’

Carter bit down hard on the inside of his cheek and said nothing.

‘ But I do know that you and Marie can be trusted to act, er, tactfully, especially considering that this is a personal matter.’

‘ Oh good , so it’s nothing to do with the fact that DI Jackman here has a priority case, there’s a major drugs case to tie up for the CPS, and everyone else is up to their necks in paperwork from the money-laundering scam that they’ve just put to bed?’ Carter couldn’t help himself, it just came out.

He felt Jackman grow tense beside him, but Ruth Crooke got in first.

‘I knew that would be your attitude, McLean.’ Her face tightened, then she sighed. ‘Look, we both know that you’ve always worked on the edge. You treat the Police and Criminal Evidence Act like a vague set of guidelines to be disregarded at will, you bend the rules, and—’"
B0755V6H321,B0755V6H32,"And she said you too, Sergeant McLean.’

Carter glanced at Jackman and pulled a face. Together they stood up and headed for her room.

Superintendent Crooke looked distinctly uncomfortable. Her thin lips were tightly pressed together. She seemed to be wrestling with her words. After a while, she took a deep breath and said, ‘My youngest niece is in trouble.’

Couldn’t happen to a better woman, thought Carter, recalling all the snide remarks he’d had to put up with from her. He kept his face impassive.

Jackman raised an eyebrow.

‘ The thing is, she thinks someone is watching her.’

Carter sucked in air. ‘ Oh?’

‘How can we help?’ asked Jackman.

‘I know that you have the missing woman to contend with, but I would like you to allow DS McLean here, and possibly DS Marie Evans, to make a few discreet enquiries.’ She sat back in her chair and stared at Carter. ‘Look, I know we don’t always see eye to eye . . .’

Too bloody right, thought Carter. And after all the hell you’ve put me through over the years, I have no intention of becoming your best buddy just because you suddenly need my help. And why me?"
B01HNJIJ3U0,B01HNJIJ3U,"He tapped the bilious face of a man who was holding a martini glass in one hand and playing the piano with the other. I decided that Gary was wrong, that I was definitely not going to know that man. He would probably be dead by the time I even turned drinking age.

The next slide showed a color photograph of a woman applying lipstick at a vanity table. The photograph had been taken from behind, but her face was visible in the mirror.

“Putting on the face: preparing the self for display, for a party or a performance,” Gary chanted. “ Look at her expression. Look at it. Does she look happy? ”

There was a long silence. “ No, ” intoned one student—a skinny junior with a shaved head, whose name either was or sounded like “Ham. ”

“ Thank you. She does not look happy. I count this as a genre scene rather than a portrait, because what we see is the generic situation: what is at stake in the invention of the self. ”

The next slide was an etching of a theater from the perspective of the stage, showing the unpainted backs of the scenery, the silhouettes of three actors, and, beyond the footlights, a big black space."
B01HNJIJ3U1,B01HNJIJ3U,"In one painting, shirtless muscular men were planing a floor. In another, gleaners stooped over a yellow field. Then came a film still of people in evening dress sitting in a theater box, followed by a cartoonish drawing of a party full of grotesque men and women leering over cocktail glasses.

“ How well do you know this party? ” Gary exhaled, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “ You look at it and think: I know that scene. I’ve been to that exact fucking cocktail party. And if you haven’t yet, you will— I guarantee it , you’ll find yourself there someday. Because you all want to succeed, and that’s the only way to do it. . . . Selin doesn’t believe me, but she will someday. ”

I jumped. The cocktail party was reproduced in miniature in Gary’s eyeglasses. “ Oh no, I believe you,” I said.

Gary chuckled. “Is that sincerity or what? Well I hope you do believe me, because someday you’re going to know that scene by heart. You’re going to know what every last one of them is saying and eating and thinking. ” He said it like it was a curse. “Power, sex, sex as power. It’s all right there. ”"
B074VG86J90,B074VG86J9,"In the next instant, however, he continues as if nothing happened. “ This is our bedroom. ” His voice is cold and flat, utterly emotionless. “ The bathroom is through there. ” He gestures at a door in the back of the room. “ You can wash up and relax while we unpack some supplies and prepare breakfast. I’ll have clothes brought here for you tomorrow, but in the meantime, there should be a robe in the bathroom and some of my clothes in the closet. ” He nods toward a set of doors on the opposite side of the room. “ If you need anything, I’ll be downstairs. Breakfast will be ready in a half hour. ”

I bite my lip. “ Okay, thanks. ”

He exits the room, and I walk over to the window, my chest aching with grief for everything I lost—and for what I just glimpsed in Peter’s eyes.

Pain.

I did hurt him, and for some reason, that hurts me.

Peter

“ She’s not happy, huh? ” Anton says quietly in Russian as I take out an oversized carton of eggs he just loaded into the fridge, set it on the counter next to the stovetop, and begin hunting for a frying pan."
B074VG86J91,B074VG86J9,"Can almost feel the stark, crushing loneliness that would’ve been my life without my tormentor.

No. No, no , no. I shake off the thought, push it away like the lunacy that it is. I did not want this. Just because I missed Peter when he was on one of his assassination missions doesn’t mean I wouldn’t have moved on eventually. And it wasn’t even him I missed. It was the deceptive comfort he provided, the illusion of love and caring. What I felt for him wasn’t real, and neither is what he thinks he feels for me. A sick lie is all it’s ever been between us, a pathological obsession on his end and an equally perverse neediness on mine.

Peter’s eyes narrow, his hands tightening on my shoulders as he processes what I said. “ So you warned me out of the goodness of your heart? You were being a Good Samaritan? ”

I nod, blinking rapidly to hold back a fresh wave of tears. That wasn’t the only reason for my lapse of judgment, but it’s the only one I’m willing to admit to.

My captor’s face hardens, and he drops his hands, stepping back. “ I see. ”

If I didn’t know better, I would’ve thought I hurt him."
B00NERQRC60,B00NERQRC6,"I did punch an Iranian diplomat in the balls once in Atlantic City, but that was when I was with the ATTF, before the DSG and before I received the proper training in dealing with the diplomatic community. I’m much nicer now.

On a related subject, a lot of people in the intelligence community (and the general public) think of the U.N. as a house of spies, which to some extent it is. But I see it as job security. I mean, if the U.N. was moved someplace else, I wouldn’t have this wonderful job. Look at what happened to all the horseshit shovelers in New York when the automobile was invented. On the other hand, I could do without this job and without guys like Colonel Vasily Petrov in town.

On the subject of job security, I asked Tess, “Who’s talking about me? ”

“Everyone. ”

“ All good, I hope. ”

“ You’re a legend. ”

“Is that why you ask to work with me? ”

“I never asked. ” She chided me, “You have a big ego. ”

Tess, I reminded myself, was not a kid trainee who just fell off the turnip truck. She was a Wall Street lawyer, probably went to good schools, and she seemed self-assured. She also seemed like a lady who was used to getting her way. I’m surprised we haven’t butted heads by now."
B00NERQRC61,B00NERQRC6,"about two hundred people, including their consulate building up on East 91st. And maybe that would explain why every time Tess Faraday was with me the target was the Russians. Or maybe that didn’t explain it. So to clear this up, I asked her, “Is it a coincidence that you’re working with me only when I’m following the Russians? ”

“ I think it’s the law of averages. ” She explained, “The other big targets are the Islamic dips, and someone told me you’re not allowed to come within a hundred yards of a Muslim. ”

I suppose that would explain it—law of averages. But I’ve also watched the Chinese, the Cubans, and the psychotic North Koreans, and Ms. Faraday hadn’t been with me on any of those occasions. But I didn’t pursue this and assured her, “I’m currently taking a class in Islamic cultural sensitivity. ”

She laughed.

In fact, I was told that I needed to remember that most of my targets had diplomatic status, and thus diplomatic immunity, even if they were spies or potential terrorists. That didn’t mean they could blow up 26 Federal Plaza with impunity, but it did mean that I needed to be more judicious and less physical in my methods."
B07B53K14R0,B07B53K14R,"In addition, every time she opened her mouth and told a lie, Allie’s heart and soul simmered in guilt. Putting herself in positions where she would have to continuously fib would not help to abate that agony at all.

Kitty and Gemma were staring at Allie, waiting for her to finish the sentence she had abandoned.

“Lovely,” she ended. “ But I do not know if I will have the time. I have only just moved to town, and my duties at home might prevent me from having time to socialize... ” She scrambled for more excuses, but Gemma grasped her forearm and nodded knowingly.

“I understand, perfectly,” Gemma answered. “ And I did not mean to force my desires on you. How about this? You get all nice and settled in your new home, and when you have time, we will call on you. ”

The sweetness in her proposition was too much. Allie’s heart ached. She longed for such kindness and female companionship, but she had assumed she left any possibilities for it behind in New York.

“ Thank you,” she answered honestly. She did not know whether she would be able to take Gemma up on the offer or not, but she appreciated the caring behind the gesture."
B07B53K14R1,B07B53K14R,"Sometimes, when I am excited, I get to talking, and I simply cannot quit. ”

Allie laughed. “ That is quite fine. I am not much of a talker myself, so you are more than welcome to fill any empty spaces. ”

Kitty cocked her head and surveyed Allie. “ I know you’re still getting settled, but would you like to attend our quilting circle once you have adjusted? ”

“ Yes, do. ” Gemma grabbed Allie’s hand in excitement. It was a bold act from a woman she’d only just met, but Allie did not find it off-putting. Gemma’s genuine enthusiasm made Allie feel that she was trustworthy.

“ That would be... ” Allie trailed off, fears entering her mind as swiftly as the desire to join the women’s quilting circle.

Would being sociable be the best idea? The more time she spent around others, the more they would want to know about her. It could become increasingly hard to dodge questions, to keep her stories synced. What if she blundered? Suppose someone asked her about her origins one day, and she allowed something too revealing to slip? She already had her hands full navigating her three new relationships with the Dentons."
B00GP0JWMQ0,B00GP0JWMQ,"Just that everything seemed so sunny and bright this morning, figuratively speaking, and now it’s like a big dark storm cloud set its head down on this place while we were all eating lunch. ”

Wes didn’t answer for a long time. Instead, he pulled out a bright- blue disposable lighter and torched the end of his cigarette, drawing hard. A cloud of smoke hung around his head. It was hot, and the air didn’t move. Not even a little bit.

“ Can’t always tell kids what they want to hear ,” Wes said at last. “ Sometimes you got to break bad news. ”

“ That’s true, I suppose. ” August took his usual seat on the low stack of tires. “ Talk to me about this idea. ”

The hand that held Wes’s cigarette came up to his face. But, rather than finding his mouth, it landed over his eyes and stayed there for a long time.

“ You’ll think I’m crazy,” Wes said.

“ So you mentioned. But go ahead and let me think what I want. I believe it’s time to get this out in the open. Whatever it is. ”

Wes sighed. Squatted down onto his heels, which put him somewhere in the neighborhood of August’s level."
B00GP0JWMQ1,B00GP0JWMQ,"So there you are again, August told it silently. I wondered.

It partially distracted him from the nagging sense that something was wrong in Seth’s question. August had said he’d had one kid. One boy. Not kids plural. More than that, though, was a sense of too much importance riding on what Seth seemed to be trying to camouflage as small talk.

“I miss him no matter what I’m doing,” August said. “ It never stops. ”

Then neither said anything for a time, and August had just about reached his limit for sitting in the hot sun. He levered to his feet and walked to the open entrance of the shop, looking back over his shoulder once before ducking into the shade. Woody chose to stay with Seth for the time being.

He found Wes working under his hood with much the same energy Seth had used to smack the tennis ball.

“ Whatever’s wrong,” August said, “please don’t take it out on my engine. ”

The mechanic’s head appeared, and he straightened up to his full height and looked August in the eye, but only briefly. “ What’s that mean? ” He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shook one out.

B01N7NTDW60,B01N7NTDW6,"I hear you,” Declan said, now looking worried and thoughtful. “ This is why you gave me that ampule of blood, isn’t it? ” he suddenly asked Tanya.

She paused and then nodded. “Partly. Partly because the rest of us have faster healing and are much less vulnerable, but yeah, I did and do think it prudent to safeguard you as much as possible. ”

“ You gave the blood away, Father. You should not give it away. ”

“ Yeah, well, that guy needed a shot at going home to his family,” Declan said.

“ It’s called altruism, Omega and it’s the same instinct that drove your father to protect you,” I said.

“ I understand, Chris. Some humans have it and some do not. But, Chris, remember— I am not human. You should now all take your seats. The captain is about to announce our descent to land. ”

“ Ah, this is the captain. We’re beginning our descent to Joint Base Andrews,” the pilot said almost as soon as Omega stopped talking.

I studied Declan, who was looking deep in thought. He glanced up and caught my eye. He was worried. I felt bad for injecting that concern into his relationship with Omega."
B01N7NTDW61,B01N7NTDW6,"”

“ Let’s say that you protected me but somehow they got through and… you know… killed me? ” the kid asked.

“I would do as any of you would… I would avenge you, Father. ”

Declan nodded, not at all shocked. “ To what degree would the vengeance go? ”

“All responsible parties. ”

“ That seems kinda what I would expect from Tanya if someone hurt or killed Chris,” Declan said, looking around at each of us.

“ Let’s imagine a scenario where the media focuses on you and your abilities. People panic and kick off a modern day witch hunt. It spreads around the globe before you are finally cornered,” Lydia asked.

“I would disrupt their lines of communications, their power grids, food supplies, medical facilities, and all other logistics. They would not corner my father because they would be fighting for their own survival,” Omega said.

“ Oh,” Declan said. “ Ah, Omega, that would kill thousands, most of whom would likely be innocent. We need to talk about appropriate responses. ”

“ I will always talk with you, Father. But without you, I am alone. I do not care to be alone, Father. ”

Don’t get me wrong. I loved her. Desperately. When I was away I counted the days – even the hours sometimes – before we’d be together again. But that didn’t mean that I couldn’t see how ill-suited we were. She was just a child. Before me her boy-friends had been schoolkids: boys who helped with logarithms and irregular verbs. Sometime she was going to suddenly realize that there was a big wide world out there waiting for her. By that time perhaps I’d be depending on her. No perhaps about it. I was depending on her now.

‘Did it all go all right?’

‘All all right,’ I said.

‘Someone from Central Funding left a note on your desk … Half a dozen notes in fact. Something about Prettyman. It’s a funny name, isn’t it?’

‘ The car’s outside,’ she whispered as she released me from the tight embrace.

‘It will be towed away by now.’

‘Don’t be a misery. It will be there.’

And it was of course. And the weathermen’s threatened snow and ice had not materialized either. This part of England was bathed in bright early-morning sunshine and the sky was blue and almost completely clear. But it was damned cold. The weathermen said it was the coldest January since 1940, but who believes the weathermen?

‘You won’t know the house,’ she boasted as she roared down the motorway in the yellow dented Mini, ignoring the speed limit, cutting in front of angry cabbies and hooting at sleepy bus drivers.

‘You can’t have done much in a week.’

B000FC2LXM0,B000FC2LXM,"Bud glanced at her clutching the video camera. Jill Winslow, he knew, was the kind of woman who might actually do the right thing and turn that tape over to the authorities, despite what it would do to her personally. Not to mention him. He thought, however, that when she saw the tape in all its explicitness, she’d come to her senses. If not, he might have to get a little forceful with her.

He said, “You know, the… what do you call that? The black box. The flight recorder. When they find that, they’ll know more about what happened to that airplane than we do, or what the tape shows. The flight recorder. Better than a video recorder. ”

She didn’t reply.

He pulled into the parking lot of the Bayview Hotel. He said, “We don’t even know if it was a plane. Let’s see what they say on the news. ”

She got out of the Explorer and walked toward the hotel, carrying the video camera.

He shut off the engine and followed. He thought to himself, “I’m not going to crash and burn like that plane. ”

Bud glanced at her, but said nothing.

She hit the Pause button and said, “I can see it. We got the whole thing on tape. ” She ran the tape forward, then backwards, several times. She said, “Bud… pull over and watch this. ”

He kept driving.

She put down the video camera and said, “We have the whole thing on tape. The missile, the explosion, the pieces falling. ”

“ Yeah? What else do you see in there? ”

“Us. ”

“ Right. Erase it. ”

“ No.”

“Jill, erase the tape. ”

“ Okay… but we have to watch it in the hotel room. Then we’ll erase it. ”

“ I don’t want to see it. Erase it. Now. ”

“ Bud, this may be… evidence. Someone needs to see this. ”

“Are you crazy? No one needs to see us screwing on videotape. ”

She didn’t reply.

Bud patted her hand and said, “ Okay, we’ll play it on the TV in the room. Then we’ll see what’s on the news. Then we’ll decide what to do. Okay? ”

B00IHMEAYA0,B00IHMEAYA,"After all, he understood that the same fearlessness, the same refusal to accept convention, the same delight in games and his same hopeless hunger to see how far he might push a situation that had driven him in the camps to help others had also driven him into the arms of Lynette Maison, the wife of a close colleague, Rick Maison, a fellow council member of the College of Surgeons, a brilliant, eminent and entirely dull man. And more than one or two others. He hoped in the foreword he had that day been writing—without bothering it with unnecessary revelation—to somehow finally put these things somewhat to rights with the honesty of humility, to restore his role to what it was, that of a doctor, no more and no less, and to restore to rightful memory the many who were forgotten by focusing on them rather than himself. Somewhere he felt it a necessary act of correction and contrition. Somewhere even deeper he feared that such self-abasement, such humility, would only rebound further in his favour. He was trapped. His face was everywhere but he could now no longer see their faces.

When he awoke an hour later, she had painted her lips cherry-red, mascaraed her gas-flame eyes and got her hair up, leaving her face a heart.

For what?

I—

For what? I’ve heard it—

I want you. Every moment I can have you, I want you.

“ Maybe,” I mumbled.

Probably.

Very probably.

Most definitely probably.

I couldn’t deny what she’d said. Over the last few months I’d begun to wonder if my relationship with Blake had passed its expiration date, like a gourmet cheese that’s been pushed to the back of the refrigerator. On the surface it might look okay, but it was starting to smell suspicious and probably wasn’t safe to eat. This latest incident was just another moldy spot, but I’d hoped a vacation might be just the thing to get us back to a better place. Maybe even take us to the next level? I mean, what woman doesn’t harbor a secret fantasy about a marriage proposal on the precipice of some active volcano? Or was that just me? Either way, since Blake had gone on our romantic vacation without me, a surprise engagement was clearly not happening.

Maybe it was time to face the Christmas music and admit my days with him were numbered. Like an Advent calendar, only without the mild anticipation and waxy chocolate. Truth be told, I had mixed emotions about the whole situation."
B00YZ4W8IO1,B00YZ4W8IO,"At thirty-four, she was five years older than me, but with her blond hair braided and tucked into the collar of her red wool coat, she looked all of seventeen. Still, I felt a lecture coming. She had that whole I’m the big sister vibe going on. “Kels, I agree that Blake should have changed his plans, but are you really that surprised? You’ve told me yourself, he’s not the most sensitive guy. ”

No. He wasn’t.

Blake Haskell might be model sexy and MENSA smart, but he wasn’t overly adept at Basic Relationship Etiquette 101. He wasn’t the type to call when he promised, or to remember birthdays or anniversaries, or to pick me up after I’d had wisdom teeth removed. Learned that the hard way. And apparently he wasn’t the type to postpone a vacation just because his girlfriend’s grandmother had taken a tumble and landed in the hospital, either. All of this I knew, deep down, but I typically excused his behavior because he never meant to be thoughtless. He just . . . was.

At my nonresponse, Erin tilted her head with a half-supportive, half-patronizing nod, the one that happily married people love to bestow upon relationship-challenged single people because they secretly believe we’re all sad and stupid and want to be them. “ Honey, maybe it’s time for an upgrade. ”"

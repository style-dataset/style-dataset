B00PMDEYF20,B00PMDEYF2,"There was something familiar about the woman returning a kitten to its crate. What was her name? Hazel? Yes, Hazel.

In the conversation that had followed, Grace discovered that Hazel, now a widow, was also a recent émigré from New Jersey. The friend with Hazel that day, Gus, was her newly rediscovered college friend, a transplant from New England.

Now living in the downtown home she’d inherited from her parents, Hazel insisted Grace and Gus come to dinner that evening, and the rest, as they say, became wonder woman history.

In Grace’s mind, Hazel was an ordinary woman with a middle-class upbringing and outlook, but now and then, she became a radical mastermind—this morning being a case in point. Hazel’s support for Bruce, her significant other, was unqualified. As board member and pro-bono counsel for the Historical Prevention Society, he wanted with all his heart and mind to save the McClellan building. Therefore, so did Hazel; and therefore, here they were on this ladder.

Looking down at Gus, Grace smiled to herself— Gus was a good friend. Not quite sixty, Gus still worked part-time as a vet tech, so she didn’t have as much free time, but she showed up for every plot and plan, kvetching, just like now."

Operation Wonder Woman

Silhouetted against the denim sky, two women ascended a ladder behind the yellow brick McClellan building, Pine Crossing’s defunct five-and-dime store. The third woman, meant to be steadying the ladder, threw up in a forsythia bush. She assigned her queasiness to the hour—four in the morning—and the garish green view through her night-vision goggles.

With ease, the three-part extension ladder reached the parapet of the second-story roof. Seventy-something Grace, clad in a black spandex outfit, her Tide-white hair stuffed under an ancient black bathing cap, went first. The most athletic of the three women, she scampered up the ladder like a spider in a hurry, her grandson’s paintball gun bungee-corded to her backpack, her fanny pack bulging with paintballs.

As she climbed, Grace reflected on the moment. How exactly had she gotten here? Wacky ideas were the trio’s forte, Grace realized, but this caper was off the charts. Hazel, now wiping her mouth at the bottom of the ladder, had been one of her more creative physical education students in high school."
B071FRWF2M0,B071FRWF2M,"He had always said Iseul was better than a son, certainly ate more than one and was grateful that all that food rendered useful because she had always managed to get more done than any son he could have ever dreamed of.

Yet, it was only in these narrow halls of school that Iseul was acutely aware of her place — she was a girl, and even a poor one at that. Though it was the last place Jung-Soo wanted to be, for Iseul, every time she walked the halls of the school, it was as if she were infringing on holy ground she wished to be worthy of.

Classes seemed to have been in progress since the sliding doors of the teacher’s office opened to an empty room. Iseul slipped the stacks of paper in the storage cabinet as she usually did and made her way to the corridors and back towards the gate. She felt the nudge of the extra pair of chopsticks against her back as she grunted and turned back towards the school to find Jung-Soo.

Stepping into the corridors again, the sliding doors of the classroom opened as a flood of boys passed Iseul as if she were invisible. She stood looking for Jung-Soo in the crowd, wondering if the whole thing was a terrible idea. And just when she decided it was best to leave, she felt a tap on her shoulders."
B071FRWF2M1,B071FRWF2M,"Mr. Lim followed his distressed son towards the house when his gaze landed on Jung-Soo. Strange, Jung-Soo thought. Mr. Lim gave no indication that there was anything wrong. Instead, he exuded a sense of tranquility that said he knew exactly what was happening. He gave Jung-Soo a look of stern reserve he had never seen in his usually spirited exterior.

Mr. Lim turned away as if he hadn’t seen Jung-Soo and closed the door of his home behind him.

* **

A few days had passed since Jung-Soo noticed suspicious activities in Byung-Guk’s home. It was, in fact, an eventuality Jung-Soo had foreseen for a while, despite his great efforts to ignore the fact that his father had always been a man of many secrets.

While Jung-Soo had turned a blind eye to what occurred at home, life outside the Golden Palace seemed to continue on as usual, as he had more than once embarrassed himself at school by falling asleep and banging his head on his wooden desk. It seemed he had something in common with Iseul.

* **

That morning, Iseul filled her wooden chige backpack with the usual supply of paper and firewood as she squatted to lift the load off the ground."
B01KKNM8UQ0,B01KKNM8UQ,"I hoped that my father, in the afterlife to which he had gone, was also celebrating Christmas and the New Year, but I feared that he was alone and that, unlike Ai-ming, he had not yet found a family to protect him. Despite my anger at him, despite the pain that wouldn’t leave me, I could not shake my longing for his happiness.

It was inevitable, of course, that Ai-ming would discover the boxes under the table. In January, I came home from school and found my father’s papers completely exposed—not because she had moved them, but because she had pushed the dining table backwards. One of the boxes had been completely emptied. Ba’s diaries, spread across the table, reminded me of the poverty of the Vancouver flea market. Worse, Ai-ming could read every character while I, his only daughter, couldn’t read a single line.

She was making cabbage salad and had grated so much horseradish that I wondered whether the cabbage would actually fit.

I said that I didn’t know if my stomach could handle that much horseradish.

She nodded distractedly and flung the cabbage in, tossing it wildly. Everything flew up in the air and rained down into the bowl."
B01KKNM8UQ1,B01KKNM8UQ,"Festive lights shone in almost every window but ours, and I had the sensation that our apartment was under scrutiny by residents of a UFO, unsure whether to land in Vancouver or fly on. The aliens in my spaceship were asking themselves: Do they have soda? What kind of food do they eat? Maybe we should wait and return in spring? Land, I told them. People aren’t made to float through the air. Unless we know the weight of our bodies, unless we feel the force of gravity, we’ll forget what we are, we’ll lose ourselves without even noticing.

Ai-ming had been reading one of my father’s bilingual poetry books. I picked it up now, a book familiar to me because I had used it in my calligraphy lessons. I paged through it until I came to a poem I knew, words my father had underlined,

Watch little by little the night turn around.

Echoes in the house; want to go up, dare not.

A glow behind the screen; wish to go through, cannot.

It would hurt too much, to see the swallow on her hairpin.

Truly shame me, to see the phoenix in her mirror.

To Hengtang I return at dawn

Fading like light on a jewelled saddle.

I read the poem twice through and closed the book."
B07763PQWN0,B07763PQWN,"So, defense against air magic or... I also had Fenrir's Claw, which I could not use at all due to level requirements! That was right! I opened my inventory. There it was:

Fenrir's Claw amulet (unique item)

Gives +250 Constitution, +250 Strength, +50% resistance to physical damage, +50 to reaction of the following creatures: Dogs, Wolves, Wargs, Volkodlaks

Attention! Your character's level is too low to use this object

Requisite level: 125

A great candidate for removing level requirement! I chose to use the Ifrit Heart for that. Nothing happened for five seconds, and the information on Fenrir's Claw didn't change. I even got worried it hadn’t worked. Although... I could now place the amulet in the proper equipment slot, which I immediately did. And, just then, the game system started spewing a whole bedsheet of text:

You have equipped two items from Fenrir’s Cursed Regalia

Hidden mission completed: True Alpha of the Gray Pack

B07763PQWN1,B07763PQWN,"Only Taisha and Valerianna were nearby at that moment, so I had nothing to hide. Not wasting time, I stuck the stone in my mouth and sucked all the moisture off it.

Achievement unlocked: Taste Tester (42/1000)

The message was, though pleasant, entirely predictable, so I wasn't surprised. But the next events showed me how little I knew about Boundless Realm. The stone suddenly gave a pulse in my mouth, as if the Ifrit heart was still alive, and my goblin swallowed it in surprise... I choked and fell down on a knee, because the stone was fairly large. It took a good bit of effort to pass. Still, I managed to work the stone down my gullet. The next message I saw made my Goblin perk up his ears in surprise:

Fame increased

Present value: 5

You are the first player to use an Ifrit Heart in this way

You have activated a magical item

You may choose one effect:

One-time experience-gain of 500000 Exp.

Permanent +5% defense against air magic

One item in your inventory will be stripped of level and skill requirements

B0036S4DS80,B0036S4DS8,"One student carried a lectern to a small paved area at the front, and the others sat down on the benches. From beyond the stone courtyard walls came the rush and hum of traffic. But Andras was here inside, sitting beside three men whose names he knew; he was one of these students, and he belonged on this side of the wall. He tried to take note of the feeling, tried to imagine how he might write about it to Tibor, to Mátyás. But before he could put the words together in his mind, a door opened in the side of the building and a man strode out. He looked as though he could have been a military captain; he wore a long gray cloak lined in red, and sported a short triangular beard with wax-curled moustaches. His eyes were narrow and fierce behind rimless pince-nez. In one hand he carried a walking stick, and in the other what looked like a jagged gray rock. Any other man, it seemed to Andras, would have had to bow under the weight of the thing, but this man crossed the courtyard with his back straight and his chin set at a martial angle. He stepped up to the lectern and set the rock down upon it with a hollow thud."
B0036S4DS81,B0036S4DS8,"He took Andras by the shoulder and introduced Ben Yakov, who resembled the handsome French film star Pierre Fresnay; and Polaner, small and light-boned, with a neat, close-shorn head and tapering hands. Andras greeted everyone and repeated his own name, and the young men’s conversation continued in quick French as Andras tried to pick up a thread of meaning. Rosen seemed to be the leader of the group; he led the conversation, and the others listened and responded. Polaner seemed nervous, buttoning and unbuttoning the top button of his antique-looking velvet jacket. The handsome Ben Yakov eyed a group of young women; one of them waved, and he waved in return. Then he leaned in toward Polaner and Rosen to make what could only have been a suggestive joke, and the three of them laughed. Though Andras found himself struggling to follow the men’s talk, and though they had hardly addressed him at all, he felt an acute desire to know them. When they went to look at the studio lists, he was glad to find they were all in the same group.

After a short time the students began to move out into the stone-walled courtyard, where tall trees overshadowed rows of wooden benches."
B009MYARIK0,B009MYARIK,"I want to be able to tell our children that I fell in love with their father all over again, the day he proposed.

Our children. Our home. Our life.

As I let my mind roll around the images, I feel a release inside me. I’m ready for this. I’m thirty-three years old and I’m ready. All my grown-up life, I’ve steered away from the subject of marriage. My friends are the same. It’s as though there’s been a crime-scene cordon around the whole area: NO ENTRY. You just don’t go there, because if you do, you’ve jinxed it and your boyfriend chucks you.

But now there’s nothing to jinx. I can feel the love flowing between us, over the table. I want to grab Richard’s hands. I want to envelop him in my arms. He is such a wonderful, wonderful man. I’m so lucky. In forty years when we’re both wrinkled and gray, perhaps we’ll walk up the Strand hand in hand and remember today and thank God we found each other. I mean, what were the chances, in this teeming world of strangers? Love is so random. So random. It’s a miracle, really. …

Oh God, I’m blinking. …"
B009MYARIK1,B009MYARIK,"We limped on for another year, and when I look back, it’s as though that second year is a big black miserable blot in my life.

Then there was Julian. That lasted two years too, but it never really took. It was like a skeleton of a relationship. I suppose both of us were working far too hard. I’d recently moved to Blay Pharmaceuticals and was traveling all over the country. He was trying to get partnership at his accountancy firm. I’m not sure we ever even broke up properly— we just drifted apart. We meet up occasionally, as friends, and it’s the same for both of us —we’re not quite sure where it all went wrong. He even asked me out on a date a year or so ago, but I had to tell him I was with someone now and really happy. And that was Richard. The guy I really do love. The guy sitting opposite me with a ring in his pocket (maybe).

Richard is definitely better-looking than any of my other boyfriends. (Maybe I’m biased, but I think he’s gorgeous.) He works hard as a media analyst, but he’s not obsessed. He’s not as rich as Julian, but who cares? He’s energetic and funny and has an uproarious laugh that makes my spirits lift, whatever mood I’m in."
B01LBEAR4W0,B01LBEAR4W,"At first. And then there’d been heat of a different kind. Vampires and shifters didn’t mate.

But oh, we’d come damn close.

It hadn’t been easy sneaking away to find places to have sex. It’d felt like being in high school all over again and trying not to get caught by my parents, except in that case, by an entire pack of mangy, angry wolves.

My stomach twisted as I remembered the things James had done to me. The things I’d done to him. And then one day, he’d gone away. Leaving no note. Nothing. I hadn’t heard from him since.

Until right now.

I could say I’d been hurt, but I hadn’t been shocked by it, either. I’d always expected him to bail on me eventually and tried to guard my heart as best I could. But when he left, it cut me deeply.

I couldn’t help glancing at his hand, looking for a ring, wondering if maybe he’d been mated yet. There was no band, not even a tan line. My stomach flipped again.

I wasn’t the same woman I’d been then. I’d seen things, grown up some. The hurt was still there, but only the memory of it."
B01LBEAR4W1,B01LBEAR4W,"James and Merc were friends from way, way back. Long before I was born, human or otherwise. But I could almost swear that Mercer didn’t seem all that happy to see James. Though he grinned, there was a tightness around his eyes that only I seemed to notice.

James didn’t smile back, but he did lift up from his seat to do a violent body-grabbing sort of hug thing with Merc. Wolves were demonstrative in their affection, more so than vampires, but that affection was always honed with a fine razor’s edge of violence, as there was to just about everything they did.

I had to admit I liked the way wolves did things. There was no scheming with them. They either liked someone or they didn’t. If they were gonna stab a person, they’d do it right to their face, so people always knew where they stood with wolves. Vampires, they would smile in someone ’s face while stabbing them in the back. There was so much politicking behind the scenes to everything they did, just a few hours in their courts left me feeling exhausted and demoralized.

James glanced back at me, the look heated but brief, before answering Mercer’s question. I wet my lips."

Well I would have been if Scent City hadn’t gone bankrupt last year and cost us thousands of pounds in unpaid bills.

I am sure that they were with the rest of the clothes. Think think! Oh no, I remember now, Ginge was cold and Mike had just got shot in Desperate Housewives, she grabbed my leggings so that she didn’t have to pause it. Knowing her, she is probably still wearing them!

Ok, don’t panic. Just keep your coat on and you’ll be fine.

So, I exit the car dressed in a pink tunic that barely covers my best Primanis, with knee high boots and a flasher mac. At least I have my Attitude glasses to pull the look together. Luckily, I have a scrunchie for my hair. Good to go."
B015J9439U1,B015J9439U,"I pull out a navy suit. Hmm this may do - oh no I’ve remembered I wore that at the last trade show, it has to be something they’ve never seen before. What about that smart black shift dress with a green jacket? No, I think I wore that to the last sales meeting. The trouble is most of the time I wear quite casual clothes to work that say to my customers - non-confrontational, easy going, no pressure rep come to have a chat and you can buy something if you want sort of thing.

I know, what about that pink tunic with leggings and knee-length boots? I can wear a smart jacket and my attitude glasses. That’s it, I will look every inch the successful sales person- and they have never seen me wear it! Right, job done. Now I just need to look up the address on multi map - the courtesy car doesn’t have sat nav - and I will be ready.

B00YHKPD560,B00YHKPD56,"The boy stumbled in the dark cellar. Fasting had left him weakened. Starved.

Rough hands pushed him onwards.

A red shape grew out from the dark. A demon. Then the boy’s eyes made it out.

A hooded figure. Master Blackstone was wearing the red cloak of the Brotherhood. His bulky form made him monstrous. Candlelight winked behind Blackstone, casting his face in shadow.

Fear pulsed through the boy. He’d drunk nothing but the bitter initiation wine and his stomach boiled. Shadows in the dark seemed to shift and bloom. There was a smell too. Like a butcher’s alley.

Blackstone’s icy blue eyes seared out. There was a deadness to them. The boy had heard whispers from higher initiates. It was said Blackstone had made a secret marriage. That his wife wore black on their wedding day. They’d heard Blackstone scream in his sleep of a sister killed by death magic.

The boy clutched an offering in white knuckles. His feet butted against a soft mound on the packed-earth floor. Dread flooded through him. A body beneath his feet. But when he looked there was nothing there and confusion tore at him. Then Blackstone’s eyes were on his. A chill ran through his soul."
B00YHKPD561,B00YHKPD56,"The girl had seized her opportunity to pickpocket a weighty purse and in a little jump she ran from the room, grabbing a silver candlestick as she fled.

A man stumbled into view, his fashionable breeches and shirt undone, face slack with confusion as the flames crackled around him. An expensive wig was perched atop his greying hair.

Beside Charlie a door banged and the girl tripped past light as a bird, with one hand holding her shift over her breasts. The other clutched her dress, and the stolen goods, to her body.

The girl turned a quick glance behind her and then halted suddenly. She was staring at him open-mouthed. For a brief moment Charlie was taken aback. His soulful brown eyes and fair hair appealed to certain women. Particularly in the context of candlelight and strong drink. But the kinked nose and scarred upper lip lent a bandit quality. And Charlie’s frame, whilst passably tall and muscular, was of a wiry configuration best suited to running and street-fighting. He was nowhere near handsome enough to stop a woman in her tracks.

Then he realised. The girl wasn’t staring at his face. Her attention was fixed on the key he wore around his neck.

Her expression was of pure terror. Slowly her lips mouthed two words."
B004KKXWMO0,B004KKXWMO,"Among the incestuous, backbiting villagers of St. James’s, the gallery had always been regarded as rather good theater—comedy and tragedy, stunning highs and seemingly bottomless lows, and always a whiff of conspiracy lying just beneath the surface. This was, in large measure, a consequence of the owner’s personality. Julian Isherwood was cursed with a near fatal flaw for an art dealer— he liked to possess art more than he liked to sell it. As a result, he was burdened with a large inventory of what is affectionately known in the trade as dead stock—paintings for which no buyer would ever pay a fair price. It was rumored that Isherwood’s personal holdings rivaled those of the British royal family. Even Gabriel, who had restored paintings for the gallery for more than thirty years, had only the vaguest idea of Isherwood’s true holdings.

They found him in his office—a tall, slightly precarious figure tilted against the front of a desk piled with old catalogs and monographs. He wore a gray chalk-stripe suit and a lavender necktie that had been given to him the previous evening by his latest love interest. As usual, he appeared slightly hungover, a look he cultivated. His eyes were fixed mournfully on the television."
B004KKXWMO1,B004KKXWMO,"LATER, THE COUNTERTERRORISM COMMAND OF London’s Metropolitan Police Service would expend much valuable time and effort trying to reconstruct the movements that morning of one Gabriel Allon, the legendary but wayward son of Israeli intelligence, now formally retired and living quietly in the United Kingdom. It is known, based on eyewitness accounts from his meddlesome neighbors, that he departed his cottage in Cornwall a few minutes after dawn and climbed into his Range Rover, accompanied by his beautiful Italian-born wife, Chiara. It is also known, due to Britain’s Orwellian system of CCTV cameras, that the couple reached central London in near-record time, and that, through an act of divine intervention, they managed to find a somewhat legal parking space in Piccadilly. From there they proceeded on foot to Mason’s Yard, a tranquil quadrangle of paving stones and commerce in St. James’s, and presented themselves at the door of Isherwood Fine Arts. According to the CCTV camera in the yard, they were admitted into the premises at 11:40 London time, though Maggie, Isherwood’s latest mediocre secretary, would erroneously record the time in her logbook as 11:45.

Purveyors of museum-quality Italian and Dutch Old Master paintings since 1968, the gallery had once occupied a lofty perch on tony New Bond Street in Mayfair. Driven into St. Jamesian exile by the likes of Hermès, Burberry, and Cartier, it had taken refuge in three floors of a sagging warehouse once owned by Fortnum & Mason."
B072KNK3H70,B072KNK3H7,"By the time we reached P & P, I was desperate for a seat and a drink.

Cass pushed the door open, and I followed her into the warmth of our favorite hangout spot. Golden lights housed in mason jars hung from the ceiling, and local art covered the walls. The bar that served coffee in the morning was now kitted out for whiskey and beer.

Connor’s music filled the air—something I didn’t recognize, but then, I rarely did. It probably was the same band from his T-shirt. He looked up from behind the bar and waved, his lopsided grin familiar. We’d been friends with Connor and his sister, Claire, for the five years we’d lived in Magic’s Bend. Connor was a Hearth Witch with a knack for potion making, so he ran P & P most of the time. Since I couldn’t see Claire, she had to be off on a mercenary gig for the Order. Her Fire Mage skills made her a good merc, and she was only part-time here at P & P.

Though the bar was cluttered with people, our favorite spot in the corner was still open. The plush chairs never seemed to be occupied, and I was pretty sure someone had enchanted them to repel others."
B072KNK3H71,B072KNK3H7,"All magic decayed with time, eventually becoming so unstable that bad shit happened. Explosions, hordes of locusts, that kinda stuff. Which meant that ancient archaeological sites were basically death traps after a while.

That’s where our shop Ancient Magic came in. Cass and Del raided tombs and temples, looking for ancient artifacts that were about to blow and brought them back to the shop. I’d conjure a replica and transfer the magical spell, which we would then sell. The process stabilized the magic, but not indefinitely. The buyer had to use the spell before it went boom, but they usually were quick about it. Once it was all done, the original artifact went back to its archaeological site.

That way, we stayed on the right side of the law and slept easy at night. I’d worked hard on my conjuring. It was my natural, non-FireSoul gift, and no one got weird about Conjurers. They didn’t hate them like they hated FireSouls.

And my gift made this whole business possible. It was a good operation. Profitable and entertaining.

Except for the break-ins.

Well, those were entertaining, just not profitable.

Unbidden, the memory of the old man flashed in my mind’s eye.

Del’s gaze sharpened."
B005BOXICM0,B005BOXICM,"I was happy for this older brother whom I barely remembered, yet somehow I felt that Mother’s present mood did not stem from any of the facts that she had so hurriedly stated. I mumbled a polite response about being glad for Jonathan’s good fortune and sipped my tea. I did wish that Mother would get to the point.

Mother didn’t even lift her cup; instead, she reached into the bosom of her gown and removed Jonathan’s recent letter. We were all used to her doing that. Whenever a letter from Jonathan arrived, she would read it through a number of times and then tuck it in the front of her dress. She carried it around with her for days and would pull it forth and reread it whenever time allowed.

She carefully unfolded it now. But rather than pass it to me as she normally did, she began to hurriedly read aloud. She passed quickly through Jonathan’s greetings as though she was anxious to get to the real heart of the letter. As I continued to sip my tea, I could hear the excitement growing in her voice. She suddenly slowed down, and I knew that she intended for me to hear and understand every word."
B005BOXICM1,B005BOXICM,"Jonathan was still special to Mother. Being her firstborn and only child from her first marriage, he was also her first love in many ways. Julie had on occasion suggested that Mother loved Jonathan more than the rest of us. I tried to convince Julie that Mother did not love him more—just differently.

I often thought how difficult it must have been for her to give him up, to let him go. Jonathan had been just nineteen when he decided that he must go west. I was only four years old at the time and too young to really understand it all, but I had been aware after he left that something was different about our home, about Mother, though she tried hard not to let it affect the rest of us. Three months after Jonathan had left, baby Matthew had arrived, and Mother’s world had taken on new meaning. Yet not even Matt had taken Jonathan’s place in her heart.

And now Mother sat opposite me, calmly serving tea, though I could tell that she felt anything but calm. Whatever the news in Jonathan’s letter, I sensed that Mother was excited rather than concerned, so her tenseness did not frighten me."
B004HW6F100,B004HW6F10,"The shawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair when she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we could not help noticing that her dress didn't nearly meet up the back and that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of stay-lace—like a summer-house.

The room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great writing-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only very untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that with our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the back kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.

But what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking though by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting the feather of her pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink. And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet, which were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden down at heel, she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her, from a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right place."
B004HW6F101,B004HW6F10,"I made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little unfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and crying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a milkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were endeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression that his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after pacifying him) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head, I thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could follow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and beadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I had not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last he was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.

Nobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in pattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I don't know with what object, and I don't think she did."
B00EGMQIJ00,B00EGMQIJ0,"But Stenton had houses everywhere—New York, Dubai, Jackson Hole. A floor atop the Millennium Tower in San Francisco. An island near Martinique.

Eamon Bailey, standing next to him in the painting, seemed utterly at peace, joyful even, in the presence of these men, both of whom were, at least superficially, diametrically opposed to his values. His portrait, to the lower right of Ty’s, showed him as he was—grey-haired, ruddy-faced, twinkly-eyed, happy and earnest. He was the public face of the company, the personality everyone associated with the Circle. When he smiled, which was near-constantly, his mouth smiled, his eyes smiled, his shoulders even seemed to smile. He was wry. He was funny. He had a way of speaking that was both lyrical and grounded, giving his audiences wonderful turns of phrase one moment and plainspoken common sense the next. He had come from Omaha, from an exceedingly normal family of six, and had more or less nothing remarkable in his past. He’d gone to Notre Dame and married his girlfriend, who’d gone to Saint Mary’s down the road, and now they had four children of their own, three girls and finally a boy, though that boy had been born with cerebral palsy."
B00EGMQIJ01,B00EGMQIJ0,"His hair was dark, at the temples striped in grey, his eyes flat, unreadable. He was more in the mold of the eighties Wall Street traders, unabashed about being wealthy, about being single and aggressive and possibly dangerous. He was a free-spending global titan in his early fifties who seemed stronger every year, who threw his money and influence around without fear. He was unafraid of presidents. He was not daunted by lawsuits from the European Union or threats from state-sponsored Chinese hackers. Nothing was worrisome, nothing was unattainable, nothing was beyond his pay grade. He owned a NASCAR team, a racing yacht or two, piloted his own plane. He was the anachronism at the Circle, the flashy CEO, and created conflicted feelings among many of the utopian young Circlers.

His kind of conspicuous consumption was notably absent from the lives of the other two Wise Men. Ty rented a ramshackle two-bedroom apartment a few miles away, but then again, no one had ever seen him arrive at or leave campus; the assumption was that he lived there. And everyone knew where Eamon Bailey lived—a highly visible, profoundly modest three-bedroom home on a widely accessible street ten minutes from campus."
B0764DQZRV0,B0764DQZRV,"The wolf scratched at her chest with its sharp claws, ripping at the stab-proof vest, but the tough Kevlar fibres of the vest blocked the wolf’s claws and saved her from the worst of the attack.

She struggled to reach hold of her baton, but the wolf had her pinned to the ground with its paws. Her elbow hurt like the devil, making her attempts to push the beast away useless.

The wolf raised its enormous head and opened its mouth ready to make a final lunge. She saw a kind of savage laughter in its yellow eyes as it rolled its jaws toward her face.

Then a police siren cut through the night air and the wolf lifted its head with a start. It stood motionless for a moment, then seemed to make a decision. With a last snarl aimed at her, it turned and fled, bounding through a gap in the cars, making its escape down the middle of the road.

Liz rolled onto her side to watch. The wolf turned right at the road junction and disappeared down a side street, almost like it knew where to go. That was strange. Why hadn’t it gone back into the park? She turned her attention back to Dave. His neck wound was bleeding heavily and his eyes stared dully at nothing in particular. She recognized the symptoms of shock."
B0764DQZRV1,B0764DQZRV,"It loped out of the bushes not more than thirty feet from the road. A wolf, with pale, golden fur and yellow eyes that gleamed in the darkness. It was as big as a man too, just like the caller had reported. The wolf ran toward them, covering the distance easily, bounding effortlessly across the grass. As it drew near, Liz noted the way it steadily quickened its pace, its long snout stretching forward keenly.

It was going to jump.

If British police carried guns like their American counterparts, this would have been the moment to use them, thought Liz. Instead she shoved Dave aside, out of the way of the wolf. The big man stumbled and she went down on top of him, her elbow jarring as it hit the cold, hard surface of the pavement.

The wolf leaped at the same time, and she felt the rush of air as it sailed over the metal fence, its jaws snapping on empty space. It landed neatly on the ground behind them and spun round to face them, its bright eyes flashing yellow with anger.

Liz jumped to her feet, but Dave was still lying on the roadside. She pulled at his arm."
B079CPWVNS0,B079CPWVNS,"For the rest of the week, Danny and Alisa enjoyed the remainder of their visit with Nana, Cami and Nick, then headed back to Savannah, early Sunday morning.

CHAPTER 8

But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

Matthew 13:20-23

Danny arrived at work early Tuesday night, as was becoming his new habit. It was the first night that he, Alisa and Steven were all scheduled to work together again since his trip to South Carolina. He clocked in and began preparing the tables in his station by polishing the silverware and glassware.

Steven arrived five minutes later."
B079CPWVNS1,B079CPWVNS,"You never know when you’re going to be stuck somewhere and have to shelter in place. Knowing when to bug out and when to stay where you are, is critical. In any type of emergency, you only leave when you’re absolutely sure it will increase your odds of survival. You could wake up one morning, turn on the television and find that the world went to heck overnight. Savannah could be in a state of complete social collapse. Your first instinct might be to evacuate, but if the streets aren’t safe due to rioting, you might be better off to stay situated until it dies down. Then again, if you can smell the smoke and hear the yelling, it might be getting close. You don’t want to get stuck in a position where you have no options because you waited too long. If you see a window to get out, take it. It’s better to go too early, miss a couple classes or have to call in sick to work than to lose your life. Worst case scenario, you miss a test or lose a night’s worth of tips, then go back home when things settle down. When you’re talking about a potential life or death situation, there’s no comparison in the trade off."
B073G2JD490,B073G2JD49,"Shortly after returning home, when she was feeling particularly sorry for herself, she met William again. She had seen him years earlier when he was apprenticed to her uncle and had been drawn to his dark wavy hair and deep brown eyes. In those early years she didn’t think he had noticed her, but when it became apparent there was some attraction between them, she struggled to contain her excitement. There was something different about him. He was quiet, courteous and polite, but behind the facade she imagined there was someone else who wanted to break free. She often thought about him while she was sewing and imagined a life with him. When she first tested the water, she feared she had frightened him off, but once they got to know each other, she knew she was right about him.

As much as she liked him, however, he was infuriating. It had taken him almost two months to ask her uncle if they could walk out together despite the fact they had both wanted to. She needed to make sure he wasn’t going to be so slow asking for her hand in marriage.

As they finished tea one evening, Mr Watkins announced he had invited Mr Wetherby and his family for dinner."
B073G2JD491,B073G2JD49,"She would often sit and stare into the distance, playing with numbers in her head, doing the calculations she had learned at school. The only time she smiled was at Sunday school, but before long she was too old to go, and her despair grew.

They had been arguing for several years, when her uncle told her she was being sent away to school. Her heart soared and she imagined she would pick up where she had left off, but her joy was short-lived. She was to go to a school for young ladies, to learn the finer points of things like sewing and music. Her uncle told her in no uncertain terms that she was expected to return as a lady, ready to accept her place as a wife. There was to be no other future for her.

This time school was difficult. She was taught how to sew, embroider tray cloths, darn socks, knit baby clothes, crochet shawls; the list was endless, and when they weren’t doing that they were being taught the history of music. It wasn’t that she didn’t like music, she did, just not the music they insisted she should listen to.

By the time she returned home the spirit had been knocked out of her."
B0788YX8NC0,B0788YX8NC,"She had tried to make Greg understand why she’d done it, but he’d refused to acknowledge the issue aside from adopting a granite-hard resolve to make sure she was never forgiven, no matter what he said to the contrary.

It might have been easier had he yelled and threatened, but he had done none of those things. Instead, he had simply distanced himself even further from his wife and the rest of the village and he had shot down the gossip before it got out of hand. She hadn’t loved the guy who’d ended up in her bed – hell, she barely even liked him – yet she couldn’t stop thinking about him. It was the feeling of closeness to a man – skin to skin – that a fleeting night with him had given her, and it was just that which filled her head. It was all she wanted, and it was much more than Greg was willing to give her these days. Why couldn’t she get her happy ending? What had she done so wrong that she didn’t deserve it?

Her head flicked up as her worst fears were realised; Josh was standing in the doorway in his pyjamas with a look of pure confusion and distress."
B0788YX8NC1,B0788YX8NC,"She’d been adamant that she knew what she was doing, that life without Greg for months at a time was no problem as long as she had him there sometimes.

It hadn’t been like that in the end. She’d moved to the village that he’d grown up in but a place where she herself knew nobody, and she’d felt more isolated every time he’d gone away to work. When Josh was born she’d struggled, mostly alone, the baby she’d hoped would temper the loneliness only exaggerating it. Greg had asked her to move to Germany permanently with him so they’d be close to his base for work but she’d been too scared and she’d pretended she was fine in Cerne Hay, but it had been a lie. The years had rolled by like this. And then there was that one fatal night when Josh had been staying with his grandparents and she’d gone out to the pub down the road. She’d drunk too much, the alcohol magnifying her loneliness, and the one friendly shoulder she’d found to cry on had been in her bed before she’d even realised it was happening.

But she wanted to forget all that now and leave it behind her – she wanted Greg’s forgiveness and for them to move on together as a couple."
B000OCXI0I0,B000OCXI0I,"It took him less than ten seconds to decide to open the door himself.

Again, there were only impressions. The storm at his back, the warmth within. There were scents—lemon, polish, lavender, and rosemary. He wondered if the old Irishwoman who ran the inn made her own potpourri. He wondered if she’d wake up and fix him a hot meal.

Then he heard the growl—deep, feral—and tensed. His head whipped up, his eyes narrowed. Then his mind, for one stunning moment, blanked.

Later, he would think it was a scene from a book. One of his own perhaps. The beautiful woman, the long white gown billowing, her hair spilling like fired gold down her shoulders. Her face was pale in the swaying light of the candle she held in one hand. Her other hand was clutched at the collar of a dog that looked and snarled like a wolf. A dog whose shoulders reached her waist.

She stared down at him from the top of the steps, like a vision he had conjured. She might have been carved from marble, or ice. She was so still, so utterly perfect.

Then the dog strained forward. With a movement that rippled her gown, she checked him."
B000OCXI0I1,B000OCXI0I,"Gray reversed, aimed the headlights, and grinned.

The sign read Blackthorn Cottage. His sense of direction hadn’t failed him after all. He hoped his hostess proved out the legend of Irish hospitality— he was two days early after all. And it was two in the morning.

Gray looked for a driveway, saw nothing but soaked hedges. With a shrug, he stopped the car in the road, pocketed the keys. He had all he’d need for the night in a knapsack on the seat beside him. Swinging it with him, he left the car where it was and stepped into the storm.

It slapped him like an angry woman, all teeth and nails. He staggered, almost plowed through the drenched hedges of fuchsia, and through more luck than design all but ran into the garden gate. Gray opened it, then fought it closed again. He wished he could see the house more clearly. There was only an impression of shape and size through the dark, with that single light shining in the window upstairs.

He used it like a beacon and began to dream of coffee.

No one answered his knock. With the wind screaming, he doubted anyone would hear a battering ram."
B01HSPXB8W0,B01HSPXB8W,"She really should have got ready earlier, she reflected, as she did have quite a long journey ahead of her. Bus to Woking Station, then a train to Waterloo and then the Underground to Paddington. Sal was cutting it pretty fine now and JoJo was going to be mightily disappointed in her if she was more than her customary ten minutes late.

She arrived at the bus stop. The New Grey Goose, still just in view, was looking fabulous, she had to admit. Sal had done a lot of work to the pub: a typical, Tudor English pub with a low-slung roof and wonky beams. When she’d acquired it, parts of the roof were falling off and the white paintwork between the beams was grey and flaking. No more. The roof was now fully tiled and weather-proof; the exterior walls an attractive, soft pistachio green and punctuated by hanging baskets and a shiny black door. Inside, she’d swapped threadbare, flocked 1980s carpet for honeyed oak floors; burgundy, peeling wallpaper for smooth, cream walls; and brasses and horseshoes and dreadful wall-mounted beer towels for tasteful, black and white Surrey pastoral views. The New Grey Goose was now a very nice pub."
B01HSPXB8W1,B01HSPXB8W,"After he’d parked his massive bike against the pub’s newly restored, gorgeous inglenook fireplace, blocking it completely, he’d deposited himself on a nearby armchair and raised both arms in an exaggerated backwards stretch, inflicting said armpits on the room and causing Sal to come rushing over with a can of Febreze and a few choice words. He’d also placed a revolting sports drink on one of her nice new tables and it had spilt sticky, orange hideousness everywhere.

What was it with men who liked to dress in restrictive, Day-Glo clothing and pretend they were permanently taking part in the Tour de France? Sal wondered, as she squeezed her bag into a shape that allowed the zip to be yanked up. She really could have done without the time-consuming eviction of man and machine this afternoon; she wasn’t exactly super-fit and had struggled wrestling a carbon-fibre frame with two giant, over-thin wheels – plus an indignant six-foot-four man with his middle-aged spread tucked into his spandex – over the threshold. Still, she hadn’t spent the last two months doing up her precious pub for it to be overrun with muddy wheels and less than savoury armpits.

Sighing, Sal hauled her bag over her shoulder and marched off down the pavement in the direction of the bus stop."
B0757WYMF50,B0757WYMF5,"He looked up as all the other monitors in the line went blank too, accompanied by a series of exasperated groans from around the room. Callum smiled to himself; the library’s server went down with an annoying frequency, but, as he got up to let Lucy know, this time it might just work in his favour.

He’d had another argument with his brothers last night. He should have walked away, but he was sick and tired of their goading. Loser, loner, they called him, as they pimped and preened themselves, ready for a night out on the pull. Two of them already had girlfriends and frankly they were welcome to their lot. Callum would rather be on his own than listen to the inane drivel they spouted, with their heaving chests spilling out from too-tight tops, lurid lipstick sticking to their teeth. That’s what had attracted him to the girl sitting beside him. She looked like the girl next door – not literally, but she was fresh-faced, with clean-looking bouncy hair, nice clothes and a genuine smile. If she was single she’d be exactly the kind of girl he’d go for, but she wasn’t; she was getting married, which meant that Callum would never dream of coming on to her, even if he did know how."
B0757WYMF51,B0757WYMF5,"But I don’t have anyone to go with.’

Lucy watched as the automatic doors closed behind her, her own mind ticking like an unexploded bomb. Well let’s see about that, shall we, she thought to herself. Then she went back through to the office, called up the county’s book catalogue and ordered Lia every single one of Noel Streatfeild’s books that she could get her hands on.

Callum had hardly been able to believe it when the same girl he had seen the other day came and sat next to him. It was her perfume that he had noticed first – something old-fashioned, like roses, or violets possibly; Callum wasn’t sure. Either way, the pen and notebook were the same. He managed a few surreptitious glances while she was working and couldn’t help but notice what she was looking at: pages and pages to do with stuff about weddings. He sighed inwardly. He’d suspected it when he’d seen her ring, but the fact she was deep into planning confirmed that there was another bloke out there far luckier than him.

There was a rapid beeping noise from the computer in front of him as the screen suddenly flickered and died."
B00PP3DNDI0,B00PP3DNDI,"He knew Carl a little bit, a decent man, pretty calm, he sold crop insurance and other kinds of insurance to people all over Holt County twenty years ago, had been elected mayor of the town for two terms. Louis never knew him well. He was glad now that he hadn’t. There were pictures of their son. Gene didn’t look like either of them. A tall thin boy, very serious. And two pictures of their daughter as a young girl.

When she came back he said, I think I’ll use the bathroom too. He went in and used the toilet and washed his hands scrupulously and squeezed out a little dollop of her toothpaste and brushed his teeth and then took off his shoes and clothes and got into his pajamas. He folded his clothes over his shoes and left them in the corner behind the door and went back to the bedroom. She had gotten into a nightgown and was in bed now, the bedside lamp alight on her side and the ceiling light switched off and the window open a few inches. There was a cool soft breeze. He stood beside the bed. She folded back the sheet and blanket."
B00PP3DNDI1,B00PP3DNDI,"So you can sneak out if you need to, in the dark.

Well no, I wasn’t thinking that.

She stood and he followed her into the dining room and the living room. Then she led him upstairs to the three bedrooms, the big room at the front of the house overlooking the street was hers. This is where we always slept, she said. Gene had the bedroom at the back and we used the other room as an office.

There was a bathroom down the hall and another one off the dining room downstairs. The bed in the room was king-sized with a light cotton spread over it.

What do you think? she said.

It’s a bigger house than I thought. More rooms.

It’s been a good house for us. I’ve been here forty-four years.

Two years after I moved back here with Diane.

A long time ago.

I think I’ll just use the bathroom, she said.

While she was out of the room he looked at the pictures on her dresser and the ones hanging on the walls. Family pictures with Carl on their wedding day, on the church steps somewhere. The two of them in the mountains beside a creek. A little black and white dog."
B071H1Y4Q30,B071H1Y4Q3,"The rebellious immortal told her the brothers were the only immortals continuing to gain strength from the death, pain, and destruction of humankind.

Darcie did not tell any of her friends what Adir shared with her–that she knew the natural aspects of the human condition continued to fuel the brothers.

The brothers continued to gain power while, at the same time, The Council commanded them to ensure no other immortals manipulated any human’s existence for their personal gain.

The double standard was the main grievance aired by members of the rebellion.

Or so Adir says.

Darcie reminded herself to take everything Adir told her with a grain of salt. She had no way of knowing if anything he said was true, not until she spoke with the brothers about it. And that was a conversation she never thought she would get the chance to have.

Sure, Bella had said she would visit. But after two weeks of silence, Darcie started to wonder if she was dumb to think the immortals would actually take the time to catch up with one human girl.

Why would she even matter when they each had thousands of years of mortals sharing in their existence?"
B071H1Y4Q31,B071H1Y4Q3,"Convinced is not the right word. A frown marred her lips.

The immortal beings used their ability to alter people’s minds and memories to facilitate her departure from Maine. Professor Abernathy knew of his daughter’s absence, but did not worry due to whatever mind manipulation used on him.

When the brothers realized Darcie may need to stay with them longer, an elaborate academic holiday to Italy was scheduled for the professor. Little did they know, the teenager would insist on returning home once she was rescued from Adir’s stronghold.

Darcie ended up only having one week with her father following her unexpected return. Despite the short notice, the family of two managed to celebrate Christmas. Though, it was done with little fanfare.

Nevertheless, her father made sure to spend the day with his daughter before flying off to examine various artifacts recently discovered in the European country. He even offered to cancel the trip for the holiday season, but Darcie knew she couldn’t allow it. He was too excited for her to agree.

Besides, she had practically forgotten about the holiday. She had been too preoccupied with being taken from her home and subsequently kidnapped by Adir to remember the popular day was approaching."
B01BD1SSO40,B01BD1SSO4,"She wore a lumpy gray sweater covered in cotton sheep and spoke like a kindergarten teacher, smiling, her sentences ending in a gentle lilt. She must’ve thought Nadia was an idiot—another black girl too dumb to insist on a condom. But they had used condoms, at least most times, and Nadia felt stupid for how comfortable she had felt with their mostly safe sex. She was supposed to be the smart one. She was supposed to understand that it only took one mistake and her future could be ripped away from her. She had known pregnant girls. She had seen them waddling around school in tight tank tops and sweatshirts that hugged their bellies. She never saw the boys who had gotten them that way—their names were enshrouded in mystery, as wispy as rumor itself— but she could never unsee the girls, big and blooming in front of her. Of all people, she should have known better. She was her mother’s mistake.

Across the booth, Luke hunched over the table, flexing his fingers like he used to when he was on the sidelines at a game. Her freshman year, she’d spent more time watching Luke than watching the team on the field. What would those hands feel like touching her?"
B01BD1SSO41,B01BD1SSO4,"By spring, she knew what time Luke got off work, when to meet him in the deserted corner of the parking lot, where two people could be alone. She knew which nights he had off, nights she listened for his car crawling up her street and tiptoed past her father’s shut bedroom. She knew the days he went to work late, days she slipped him inside the house before her father came home from work. How Luke wore his Fat Charlie’s T-shirt a size too small because it helped him earn more tips. How when he dropped to the edge of her bed without saying much, he was dreading a long shift, so she didn’t say much either, tugging his too-tight shirt over his head and running her hands over the expanse of his shoulders. She knew that being on his feet all day hurt his leg more than he ever admitted and sometimes, while he slept, she stared at the thin scar climbing toward his knee. Bones, like anything else, strong until they weren’t.

She also knew that Fat Charlie’s was dead between lunch and happy hour, so after her pregnancy test returned positive, she rode the bus over to tell Luke."
B0777KS8VM0,B0777KS8VM,"The archenemy phase was finally over and the two women were more or less frenemies now...maybe even friends.

Judith had helped with Ruth’s case and most recently, when Lucy was in trouble. She wouldn’t call Judith salt-of-the-earth, but the woman had redeeming qualities. Being loyal to her friends was at the top of the list.

The girls’ breakfast arrived and while they ate, they discussed the case. Gloria still firmly believed someone inside the Montbay Sheriff’s Station was involved in the extortion or knew someone who was involved.

She thought about Cal Evergreen, City Commissioner. She wondered if there was some way she could approach him to ask him some questions. She had heard rumors he was a hard man and rude to boot.

How could a public figure be so unlikeable yet still keep getting re-elected? Unless, of course, he had connections, which wouldn’t surprise Gloria. She believed some people who held government positions got to where they were by greasing someone’s palm.

After they finished eating, Gloria slipped her jacket on and headed to the cash register. Andrea was right behind her.

Gloria handed Dot her ticket and debit card. She swiped the card and handed it back."
B0777KS8VM1,B0777KS8VM,"A picture of Mitzi, wearing a black and white ballroom gown and holding a glittery gold mask to her face popped up first.

Gloria enlarged the picture and studied the woman’s facial features. A twinkle of mischief sparkled in her sharp blue eyes. Mitzi looked as if she had a secret she was keeping.

Several articles described Mitzi’s love for her family and furry pets. She owned a large horse farm in Rapid Creek and split her time between the horse farm and a large estate in East Grand Rapids, the tonier part of the city.

Mitzi was one of two people who had received Paul’s extortion note. From what she had heard, Paul had contacted her directly. She remembered Minnie telling her there were even more victims, yet to be named.

Gloria drummed her fingers on the desktop. She wondered how hard it would be to approach the wealthy socialite.

Gloria had reached a dead end. Other than track Paul down and demand he let her help in the investigation, she was running out of options. Gloria’s pride wouldn’t allow her to approach Paul.

He was the one threatening to call off the wedding. He was the one who left town without telling her where he was going, although he had called but didn’t bother leaving a message."
B003Z9KFDU0,B003Z9KFDU,"The March winds came off the St. Lawrence in a rush, nosing up Montreal’s narrow lanes to seek out Nathaniel where he stood in the shadows of the Auberge St. Gabriel. Most of the city’s residents had retreated over slick cobblestones to their dinners by the time the seminary clock chimed four, but Nathaniel stood motionless and attentive, oblivious to the icy snow that rattled on roofs of tin and slate.

The door of the tavern opened and a servant clattered out, bent to one side by the weight of her basket. Behind her followed two redcoats, shoulders hunched. Nathaniel pressed himself harder against the wall, relaxing even as they went past. Their eyes were fixed on their boots, and their minds on the duty that had drawn them away from hearth and ale. He was invisible to them.

Nathaniel continued scanning the darkening street. Between the houses opposite there was a small flash of movement. A child, underdressed, searching the gutter as he slipped along in the shadows. For a moment Nathaniel watched, and then he stepped into the lantern light and held up a coin. The boy’s gaze snapped toward the faint shimmer and he angled across the lane in three bounds, to follow Nathaniel into the shadows."
B003Z9KFDU1,B003Z9KFDU,"She had encouraged him to go; she had insisted on it. And still the idea of his going was suddenly overwhelming. Elizabeth was filled with dread, with vague worries about Montréal and the troubles there, with more detailed imaginings of the things that might come to pass—that often came to pass—in the endless forests, and with irritation at herself. She would not make this leave-taking harder on him.

But she must study his face now. This face she knew so well. He would be thirty-six years old in the spring and already there was a single strand of white at his hairline. Straight brows, a scar beneath his left eye. The strong lines of nose and jaw. His mouth, the curve of it. The groove in his chin where the shadow of his beard was darkest.

The sun had not yet risen, but she sensed a change in the rhythm of his breathing. There was a small tremor in the muscle of his cheek. She held her breath, hoping that he would settle again, hoping he would sleep until noon if it would keep him here one more day.

His arm came up and around her, and pulled her down to him."
B00TFX0HYC0,B00TFX0HYC,"With the result that more and more people were deceived into this…this lie…this disease from the pit of hell.

Pastor Kemp still remembered the day her daughter came to her and told her she was one of them. Told her she had a girlfriend. That she wanted to live her life in the worst sin possible. She had asked her to understand, asked her mother to bless them and what they called their relationship. She had asked her to open up her mind and told her this was the hardest thing she’d ever had to tell her mother, and that she had been terrified for years to let her know, because she knew how she felt about homosexuals.

Pastor Kemp hadn’t cried that summer day in 1995. Not even when she told her to get out and never come back. Not when she looked into her daughter ’s eyes and told her she wasn’t her daughter anymore. Not when her daughter cried and begged for her mother’s acceptance.

But she did cry three years later, when Camilla came one day to the house holding a VHS-tape with the movie in her hand. Her face was pale and her body wasting away."
B00TFX0HYC1,B00TFX0HYC,"She was working on her sermon for next Sunday, and thought with joy about last Sunday’s speech. She had talked about gays and how homosexuality didn’t belong in the church and how it was an abomination, according to the Bible. She had long watched where the country was going on this, and now that the church accepted those kinds of people getting married within the church walls, she knew it was time for her to speak up.

Pastor Kemp was old and knew she didn’t have many years left before she had to resign. And she was determined to fight for the truth till the end. They’d have to carry her out of her church. She wasn’t going to let anyone of that kind get married in her church. And she would let her congregation know how she felt about it. There was no doubt in her mind that she would never approve this.

When the head bishop had told her the church was ready to change its views on homosexuals and let them get married, she hadn’t believed her own ears. She knew it was being debated. She knew there were forces of evil out there trying to change things, but she had never thought they would succeed."
B017S448NU0,B017S448NU,"throttle halfway and the big motorcycle engines roared, lifting the boat up on plane almost instantly.

Knot L-8 is a great little boat. She has strong oak ribs, overlaid with western red cedar on the hull and mahogany and teak on the fore and aft decks, then a thin skin of fiberglass and epoxy. It’s the aft section that’s most notable. Carl and I built her with a barrel-back design, the rear deck and engine compartment hatch sloping down from the rear cockpit and the gunwales flaring inboard. The aft section is about all that other boaters see of her, as she’s quite capable of reaching seventy knots or more on calm water.

I kept the speed down in the small swells of the Atlantic, while Linda made a phone call. She ended the call just as we reached the Seven Mile Bridge and the calmer waters to the north of it. Turning left and paralleling traffic moving across the bridge, I opened the big motorcycle engines up and we were soon skimming across the glassy sheltered water, passing the cars on the bridge like they were standing still.

Looking over at Kim and Linda, I saw that both were smiling, their hair flying back wildly in the slipstream."
B017S448NU1,B017S448NU,"Like Darius, her feet were tied to a post and her arms to a crossbeam at shoulder height. Her blouse was torn at the shoulder. She’d fought back against their attackers with a vengeance. The dried blood on the left shoulder of her light green blouse proved it. It had come from a gash in her forehead where one of their attackers had hit her with the butt of an assault rifle.

Darius calculated that they’d been trussed up like this for nearly a full day. However, with no windows in the dark and musty room they were in, he couldn’t be certain. How long they’d been knocked out before getting here, he couldn’t even guess at. His mouth was parched, his lips cracked and dry. Their captors had gassed them shortly after the attack, and the effect of the gas was only now dissipating. It could have been hours or days, he had no way of knowing.

Hearing a moan, he looked to his left and saw that Celia was just beginning to come around. He’d woken twice that he knew of since the attack, but Celia had already been beaten unconscious before they were gassed. He had no idea if she’d awakened before now."
B01CGBC72E0,B01CGBC72E,"I make my way to the back of the bar, where there’s an alcove hosting an old payphone that doesn’t work anymore. Aside from a bathroom stall, this is the quietest place in the whole joint. As I scroll through my contacts, my tea-addled brain is assuring me that this is a great idea. I’m going to call Rowdy and apologize for shooting his brother five times in the chest. I grit my teeth hard to keep the emotions that want to take over in check, and my chin trembles with the effort.

Maybe if I can get one person in that family to forgive me, I could work on forgiving myself. It’s a long shot, but at this moment, with my head spinning right round like a record, baby, it seems like an awesome idea.

I press the button that will dial up his number, put the phone to my ear, and wait for the call to connect. But suddenly it’s just my fingers there at my ear and my phone is gone. It takes me a couple seconds to figure out what’s happening.

I turn around and find Lucky there, holding my cell phone in his hand and smiling at me. He looks at the screen as he presses the red button to disconnect the call."
B01CGBC72E1,B01CGBC72E,"Her constant cheer is something I’ve almost gotten used to after six months of working with her, but it hasn’t been easy. Sometimes I just want to put her into a headlock and squeeze that absurdly overdone happiness out onto the floor. I smile when I imagine her as a giant tube of glittery toothpaste that needs emptying.

Ozzie is more low-key, letting me know with a vague nod that he sees me sitting at the bar. Just behind the couple come my brother Thibault and my teammate Lucky. I’ve known Lucky practically my whole life, so it’s tempting to say he’s like a brother, but I can’t do that. When we were kids, we got stupid and kissed once, so I could never see him like I do Thibault.

Lucky and I never repeated that mistake, but that doesn’t stop me from thinking about it from time to time. Now is one of those moments. He looks especially good in that black leather jacket, with his hair all messed up and hanging in his face. When he broods like I think he’s doing now, I can’t stop thinking about what might be bothering him. I’ve always been drawn to the darker side of things.

May interrupts my wandering memories by grabbing me in a hug."
B01NABXI380,B01NABXI38,"Left almost without means, with no fortune but a hundred ruined serfs, he folded his hands and never during the remaining twelve years of his life troubled himself to inquire what he was living on and who was supporting him. At the same time he insisted on having all the comforts of life, kept his carriage and refused to curtail his expenses. Soon after his marriage he lost the use of his legs and spent the last ten years of his life in an invalid chair wheeled about by two seven-foot flunkeys, who never heard anything from him but abuse of the most varied kind. The carriage, the flunkeys and the invalid chair were paid for by the undutiful son, who sent his mother his last farthing, mortgaged and remortgaged his estate, denied himself necessaries, and incurred debts almost impossible for him to pay in his circumstances at the time; and yet the charge of being an egoist and an undutiful son was persistently laid at his door. But my uncle’s character was such that at last he quite believed himself that he was an egoist, and therefore, to punish himself and to avoid being an egoist, he kept sending them more and more money."
B01NABXI381,B01NABXI38,"And, in the midst of these reproaches, protests and shrill upbraidings, she all at once quite unexpectedly got married herself before her son, though she was forty-two years of age. Even in this, however, she found an excuse for blaming my poor uncle, declaring that she was getting married solely to secure in her old age the refuge denied her by the undutiful egoist, her son, who was contemplating the unpardonable insolence of making a home of his own.

I never could find out what really induced a man apparently so reasonable as the deceased General Krahotkin to marry a widow of forty-two. It must be supposed that he suspected she had money. Other people thought that he only wanted a nurse, as he had already had a foretaste of the swarm of diseases which assailed him in his old age. One thing is certain, the general never had the faintest respect for his wife at any time during his married life, and he ridiculed her sarcastically at every favourable opportunity. He was a strange person. Half educated and extremely shrewd, he had a lively contempt for all and everyone; he had no principles of any sort; laughed at everything and everybody, and in his old age, through the infirmities that were the consequence of his irregular and immoral life, he became spiteful, irritable and merciless."
B00G3L13DS0,B00G3L13DS,"She remembers how kind and attentive he was the spring after they moved to Lancaster, when her mother took to her bed, complaining of pains in her bowels and chest. Throughout her long dying, he came daily to offer prayers and Christian comfort. He often ate at their table. Mary became acutely aware of each time Joseph’s gaze fell on her. His glances caused something at the base of her spine to shiver with pleasure. When he departed, she felt strangely exhausted and yet she wanted to run all the way up the hill behind the house and spin in circles under the trees.

Mary recalls lying next to her sister Elizabeth on their pallet in the chamber over the kitchen, telling her everything. She was in love, she said. She would not rest content until she became Joseph Rowlandson’s wife. She thought Elizabeth would sympathize because she had recently become engaged to Henry Kerley. Instead, her sister clucked her tongue and told Mary what a foolish girl she was. Love was not something that fell on a person out of a clear sky, but a warm affection that slowly grew from years of sharing life’s toils.

Mary removes her arm from Bess’s shoulder and presses her hands together with sudden resolve."
B00G3L13DS1,B00G3L13DS,"But Mary had had to look away as she felt a great sinking in her chest and saw her mother’s face sag with fear. Only Mary’s married older sister and brothers had been able to stay in Wenham.

Since coming to Lancaster, Mary had tried unsuccessfully to conquer her misery but, as she looked up at the minister that afternoon, something in his sharp blue gaze suggested that she might have prospects in Lancaster after all.

• • •

Now, for the first time in her married life, Mary defies her husband. On a warm, gray day when Joseph is called to the neighboring town of Groton to investigate a case of witchcraft, she packs a basket of food and carries it to the Parker farm. She finds Bess sitting in the yard, suckling Silvanus.

The girl smiles when she sees her. Mary lowers the basket and admires the babe, brushing his cheek with the tip of her finger and tucking her thumb into his tiny fist. She is touched when Bess asks if she’d like to hold him.

Mary cradles the small, warm body against her breasts, inhaling the milky perfume of his breath that rises from between his parted lips. She rocks him back and forth and closes her eyes. She remembers her own newborns so vividly that tears rise."
B00H2Z5UUG0,B00H2Z5UUG,"Wolf had cringed that day for an hour and a half, watching Jack catch the ball repeatedly, just avoiding the man-child, who bowled over less fortunate kids like empty beer cans, leaving them whimpering in his wake wherever he went.

The reality was, there were kids like that all over the state now. They were sprouting feet over night, gaining pounds, a bushel of body hair, a deep voice, and a shot of untamed testosterone that made them love smothering little grunts like Jack into the turf all the more. The scary part to Wolf and Sarah was that Jack seemed to enjoy it all too much. Although Wolf was secretly proud of Jack for being such a daredevil, he also felt like he was playing Russian roulette with his son’s safety.

What was the world coming to when an ex-collegiate-level football player was telling his son he didn’t want him playing because it was too dangerous?

Wolf shook the thoughts out of his head and looked up at the stars.

For a few minutes, they crouched next the fire in silence. Jack’s aromatic hotdog sizzled, dripping hissing juices into the fire while Wolf’s gas stove blasted, struggling mightily to boil water in the oxygen-starved environment."
B00H2Z5UUG1,B00H2Z5UUG,"Wolf’s stomach churned as he pictured the scarred, bearded man, trapped under the crushing weight of his overstuffed backpack, taking his final breaths as he bled out somewhere far below.

Wolf inhaled deeply and calmed himself down. The fact was, those shots were close—at least closer than the man they’d passed would have been. If that man had continued at his same frantic pace, he would have been miles down the trail, near Wolf’s parked truck by now, around at least two bends in the valley.

No, Wolf and Jack wouldn’t have been able to hear the shots with such clarity had that man just been shot at. Unless he had turned around and headed back toward us.

Was Wolf’s imagination redlining? Or had whatever, or whoever, that man was running from finally caught up to him? And what did that mean for Jack and Wolf?

Chapter 6

A half-moon hung just above the eastern wall of the amphitheater valley, bathing the western shoreline of the lake with a soft glow, casting ink shadows of all shapes and sizes across their campground. There were no clouds above, only the stars, planets, galaxies, star clusters, and other relics of the recent and ancient past gleaming in every nook and cranny of the sky.

The flickering flames of the fire licked straight up in the calm night."
B01EW3MSCI0,B01EW3MSCI,"The change in the pitch of the engines woke me about four hours later. Tony and I talked for a bit longer before I came down to the guest stateroom for a nap and left him at the helm. He seemed pretty sure that he would be leaving the Navy when his tour was up at the end of the summer.

I rose from the bunk, still fully dressed in khaki cargo shorts and a Gaspar’s Revenge Charter Service tee shirt. The Revenge has two staterooms. The master stateroom has a single queen-sized bunk, and the guest stateroom has two single berths that can be made into a queen and a Pullman-type upper above them. The L-shaped couch in the salon can also be converted into a double berth, so the Revenge can sleep seven in a pinch—and we’d be pinched getting back to Florida, with the four of us and our two guests on board.

I slipped on my boat shoes and went up to the galley. The coffee in the coffeemaker looked and smelled fresh, so I poured a cup, noting that Tony was asleep in the salon. When I got to the bridge, Bourke was at the helm and Art in the second seat."
B01EW3MSCI1,B01EW3MSCI,"It’s called the Tongue of the Ocean, or TOTO, due to its appearance, running almost north to south for a hundred and fifty miles and roughly twenty miles wide. I knew the crushing depth of the bottom was more than a mile down and seas there would likely be a lot bigger, kicked up by the outer bands of a hurricane sitting a thousand miles to the east. The TOTO was favored by rich fishermen in big expensive boats, just like the Revenge. So I wasn’t worried about the authorities.

I’ve known Henry Patterson nearly my whole life, though I’ve only seen him a handful of times in the last twenty-five years. He and Pap had fought together in the South Pacific. When he returned home, he went into public service. A mud-slinging campaign by an opponent during a Florida senate race nearly twenty years ago left him physically and emotionally drained. His wife had only recently passed away, and with no kids, there really wasn’t anything keeping him in Fort Myers. He’d bowed out of the race gracefully, though there was nothing to the allegations, got on his boat and disappeared. At eighty-four now, he ran a small fleet of fly-fishing skiffs and offshore charter boats on the north end of Andros."
B075VWNQQG0,B075VWNQQG,"Joe’s mother was convinced her son’s fits were the work of the devil, punishment for bearing a bastard. Dr. Warner told her most stridently not to be so foolish. Joe was not possessed of a demon. He suffered with the falling sickness, many children did, and it was not her fault or his. On one of Joe’s many visits, Lisa had witnessed him have a fit. It had come on suddenly, without warning, his thin little body wracked with violent spasms, contorting his limbs and his face. It had ended just as abruptly, leaving Joe limp and exhausted, as if the life force had been sucked from him. She had never seen an adult have such an attack and had wrongly presumed the falling sickness a childhood ailment. Yet, here was this gentleman, a man who seemed healthy in every other particular, in much the same reduced state as poor Joe. So he was not drunk, or mad, but a fellow sufferer…

Decided, she looked up at Becky, a hand to the stranger’s shoulder, hoping touch might offer reassurance that he was not alone, just as she had done with Joe—though she had no reason to believe, that just like Joe, he was aware of her presence."
B075VWNQQG1,B075VWNQQG,"His left arm remained bent at the elbow and adhered to his chest, and his fingers gnarled and clinging to a couple of the covered buttons of his metallic-threaded waistcoat.

Lisa wondered from these contortions if he were in pain. Yet, he hardly made a sound. She leaned in, beckoning Becky to bring the light closer, to better illuminate his face. His mouth was twisted, pulled to one side like the rest of his body, with the lips slightly parted from which issued forth a low gurgling, but no intelligible words.

She sat back on her haunches, pondering what to do, and was distracted by the voices coming from the drawing room, where the door was still wide. At least the gentlemen were no longer shouting at one another, or disturbing the furniture.

Instinctively, she knew the last thing this gentleman would want was for his friends to see him in such a reduced and vulnerable state. No doubt that was the reason he had tried to leave the room in such a hurry. So she had Becky quietly shut the door, hoping the gentlemen were too caught up in themselves to even notice one of their number was no longer with them.

And as he continued to convulse, Lisa was reminded of young Joe, son of a local laundress, an Irishwoman, and a patient of Dr. Warner."
B00SIBU4540,B00SIBU454,"Reaction times were interesting things. Maddox’s reflexes and ability to decide bordered on the miraculous, at least to those who had never witnessed them before. Before the call, he had already begun to suspect the chief security officer. The video hadn’t shown Meta leaving her apartment. The lingering perfume and the shock rod discharge meant she couldn’t have left two hours ago. It had to be within the last hour, and this video hadn’t shown that.

In any case, Maddox’s suspicion allowed him to react faster to Paris than he would have otherwise. The first time she waved the needler, Maddox made his decision to go for it. The second jerk to the left caused his right hand to come down faster than a striking rattlesnake. He released the comm-unit and caught the woman’s gun-hand. At the same time, she pulled the trigger. Maddox twisted his wrist and yanked hers hard. The first steel needle punctured the muscle and fat of what should have been a love handle. Maddox was steely lean and lacked those, but his side still had a small deposit of fat there. The second and third needles missed his body and stuck the wall behind him."
B00SIBU4541,B00SIBU454,"Scanning the room—

Maddox’s heart thudded. He spied a pad propped on the bed’s pillow. Cautiously, he approached it and read the message about her need to leave Earth. She’d ended abruptly in mid-sentence, which seemed strange. There weren’t any explanations or anything about their time together. That struck Maddox as wrong.

He whirled around, moving to the mirror. He scanned the scant belongings there. He didn’t see any perfume bottles. Going into the bathroom, he checked the cabinet and found nothing, not even a tube of toothpaste.

If Meta had left like this, would she have taken the perfume he’d specially bought her those many months ago? Suspicion flooded his eyes. Holstering the gun, Maddox hurried to the door. He needed to speak with the building’s security chief.

* * *

A few minutes later, Maddox stood with the Dempsey Tower’s security chief, a short, precise woman in a red blazer. Her brown hair was pulled back so tightly it seemed it might hurt her skull. On a large screen, they watched a video of the last half hour before Meta’s door.

It showed an older couple passing the hidden camera, but nothing else except for Maddox entering the room."
B0176BJYSO0,B0176BJYSO,"Family members his mama’s age and younger had taken to the out-of-doors, sprawling out on blankets beneath the shade afforded by the tall oaks at the rear edge of the property, praying for a breeze.

Jesse’s aunties by blood hovered around the kitchen, getting under his mama’s feet, arguing over the cooking. Aunties through marriage, the wives of his father’s kin, knew better than to join the fray, choosing instead to watch over the children, both the little sleeping ones like Jilo, and the wild, older ones, who were roughhousing and running around, shrieking with laughter until someone would remind them of the passing they’d come to honor. For a time, the laughter would fall silent, replaced by an unnatural, though blessedly temporary, stillness.

Jesse didn’t like the quiet. When it got quiet he could hear his family’s whispers.

That his mama owned this place outright stood as a matter of pride for the whole family. Not many folk around Savannah, white or colored, owned their own houses, and this one even had enough land for a vegetable garden. Jesse’s daddy had been a cook on one of the Central Railroad’s executive cars. He’d worked for years to squirrel away the money for this house, not wanting to marry until he had a home for his wife. That was why he’d married a woman sixteen years his junior."
B0176BJYSO1,B0176BJYSO,"The caretaker of the cemetery stood at a distance, leaning on the same rake he would use to scrape the grave clear of the pottery as soon as the last of the family was out of sight. The cemetery belonged to the city, after all, and Savannah had no more room for the family’s traditions than her fool of a daughter-in-law did.

May was surprised to see a young white man approach the caretaker. Even from this distance, which made it hard to get a good look at his features, May could see his suit appeared well made, expensive. His light blond hair caught the light. May wondered what interest this buckra could have in an old black woman’s funeral, his gaze fixed as it was on the dwindling party. She watched as the caretaker nodded his head again and again, like it was on a loose spring. He seemed anxious to convey his understanding of—or perhaps agreement to—the white man’s words. The two conversed for another minute or so, then the white man reached out and patted the caretaker ’s back. He turned away and headed toward a shiny black car waiting just outside the cemetery gate. As the buckra drew near, another man, dressed in livery, rushed to open the car’s back door at the exact moment of his arrival."

THOMASINA When you stir your rice pudding, Septimus, the spoonful of jam spreads itself round making red trails like the picture of a meteor in my astronomical atlas. But if you stir backward, the jam will not come together again. Indeed, the pudding does not notice and continues to turn pink just as before. Do you think this is odd?

SEPTIMUS No.

THOMASINA Well, I do. You cannot stir things apart.

SEPTIMUS No more you can, time must needs run backward, and since it will not, we must stir our way onward mixing as we go, disorder out of disorder into disorder until pink is complete, unchanging and unchangeable, and we are done with it for ever. This is known as free will or self-determination.

He picks up the tortoise and moves it a few inches as though it had strayed, on top of some loose papers, and admonishes it.

Sit!

B000OIZV5W0,B000OIZV5W,"He could hear Sean singing away in the background. Now, that sounded normal. He smiled.

Ten minutes later, Sherlock climbed out of Jimmy Maitland’s old jeep, which he left at the cabin for his boys’ use. She was worried about Dillon, feeling more scared than usual, perhaps because they were on vacation and this was so unexpected. With Sean asleep in the backseat, snoring little puffs of cold air, she could let the worry show on her face. She stood a moment, looking into the sheriff’s small office, with its single light shining in the wide front windows. She saw an older man with a thick shock of white hair, fiddling with a coffeemaker. Good, he had to be the sheriff. He’d taken her seriously.

Sheriff Doozer Harms stood in the middle of his office, his back to his coffeepot, his arms crossed over his beefy chest as he watched a man pull up behind the woman’s jeep. The man opened the jeep’s passenger side, unfastened the child’s car seat strap, and lifted out a sleeping boy. They all huddled close, then turned, as one, toward his office.

The man pulled his I.D. out even as he stepped into the office."
B000OIZV5W1,B000OIZV5W,"He slowly rose, stretched, and stared up again into that black hole, wondering what had hit him. If not a person, and he was pretty sure it hadn’t been a man, then there were few logical choices. Bats, he thought, he’d probably disturbed a whole lot of bats. What would bats be doing in a beautiful house like this one? For the life of him he couldn’t think of anything else it could have been. And maybe the bats had made the noise. Perhaps bats were common up in the Poconos, particularly in the winter, when the cold drove them inside, to places where it was dark and warm.

Enough was enough. He strode to the top of the stairs, paused one final time, listening, fingers tightly wrapped around his SIG.

He had to get her to talk to him, had to calm her, it was the only thing left to do. He took the stairs two at a time and rushed into the living room, his mouth opening to tell her he hadn’t found anything.

Also, just wondering if—do you have a problem with cigarettes? I’m working on a submission for a cigarette campaign to air in France, I think, or someplace Europe-y. Anyway, you wouldn’t have to actually smoke the cigarette, I don’t think—Jenny, does she have to put it in her mouth? No? Okay, so you’d just have to hold the lit cigarette while smoke comes out of it. You’d get extra for hazard pay. Let us know!

B072MFQLN50,B072MFQLN5,"Arcs of fire lanced across his skin, seared through his bones. He didn’t grimace. This pain, this physical hurt, couldn’t hold a candle to the hell that Water had dragged him through. This was just a reminder that he was still alive.

After what seemed like hours, he closed off to Earth.

The Spheres all had a backlash as unique as their power, but Earth’s was, in many ways, the most dangerous. Earth was like a drug: when you were on it, you felt invincible, high, immortal. The moment it left you, you were sharply reminded just how weak and mortal and close to death you truly were.

His limbs, though healed, shook as he forced himself to sitting. His heart raced and his stomach wanted to eat itself, but at least he hadn’t used so much that he passed out. Or lost a chunk of hair. Again. He just hoped that nothing would break when he moved.

Together, the two of them hoisted each other up to standing. Katherine wouldn’t meet his gaze; she stared out at the creatures littering the ground around them. Limbs and carcasses were splayed everywhere and, even with the rain, the stink was atrocious. Blood pooled dark and thick like an oil spill."

Nothing else moved in the world.

Just the rain.

Just his breath.

Just his blood mixing with the dead.

CHAPTER TWO

HE DIDN’T KNOW how long he lay there. The wind and rain were a constant roar, but their sound was distant compared to the throb of blood in his ears, the roar of memories in his head.

His house is empty. Too empty. He walks. The gun is gone. His hand is covered in blood. Blood, like the blood streaking the walls. Where is the gun? Where are his parents? He shakes. He walks. Water roars within him, a tide that drowns the screams outside. His house is too empty. His house is too silent. He shakes as he walks and the blood-streaked halls tilt. He shakes, and the back door swings. He walks, and his silent house bleeds.

Something brushed his cheek. Frayed nerves snapped to life, and his eyes fluttered open.

Katherine knelt beside him. Blood stained her skin, and long gashes webbed across her in leaking lines."
B00JYSVZH60,B00JYSVZH6,"Fab was in more danger than when she faced down the drug dealer pointing a gun in her face, and besides I knew Gabriel would spot the inconspicuous Hummer in a second.

I was so preoccupied with Fab’s problems, I couldn’t remember driving along the beach, which was my favorite route from my house to The Cottages. Before last night, it had been a ten-unit, three-sided square building that had direct beach access. My strengths were used in renovating the units and grounds. For day-to-day management, I hired a double Red Bull-drinking manager. Mac handled the tenants and their flakey friends with tough love.

Turning the corner, I almost ran into Miss January, who’d wandered into the street pacing, holding Kitty. Miss January was another tenant I inherited from my aunt; a fortyish woman who looked eighty, was consumed with cancer, and self-medicated with vodka and cigarettes. There were no signs of dementia except where her cat was concerned, never acknowledging that Kitty had been dead a long time and was stuffed.

I pulled into a parking space reserved for the office, jumped out, and cut across the grass to find Miss January before a car hit her.

Tears streamed down Miss January’s face."
B00JYSVZH61,B00JYSVZH6,"Chapter 2

Getting carjacked forced me to stop at home to shower and change. I couldn’t show up to a party with dried blood on my arms and legs, not to mention the little pieces of gravel that embedded themselves into my skin from the pitch and roll. After going through my closet I chose a black lacey push-up bra and spaghetti strap dress. My first dress choice lay on the floor, a large unrepairable hole along one side. Since one of the heels had snapped off my shoe, I opted for a pair of black wedge designer flip-flops.

I inventoried the cars in the parking lot of Jake’s and determined I was the last to arrive. Jake’s, my favorite sports tiki bar, was under new management. Jake, one step ahead of heavy hitter collectors, had transferred his entire interest to me for safekeeping. Word had it they wanted their money, or him dead. I hadn’t made any major changes to the exterior, but I hired a contractor to make long-needed repairs and to add more outdoor lighting. All the palm trees were wrapped in lights with colorful annuals planted at the base of each.

As soon as I put the Hummer in park, the door handle jerked open and I screamed."
B000TU16MM0,B000TU16MM,"I myself began to feel my confidence in Providence increase as I beheld the affecting group. Heaven will surely have pity on them, thought I, and will save their parents to guard their tender years!

At this moment a cry of Land, land, was heard through the roaring of the waves, and instantly the vessel struck against a rock with so violent a motion as to drive every one from his place; a tremendous cracking succeeded, as if the ship was going to pieces; the sea rushed in, in all directions; we perceived that the vessel had grounded and could not long hold together. The captain in a mournful voice called out that all was lost, and bade the men lose not a moment in putting out the boats. The sounds fell on my heart like a blow from a dagger: We are lost! I exclaimed; and the children broke out into piercing cries. I then recollected myself, and endeavoured to be more composed; and addressing them again, I exhorted them to courage, by observing that the water had not yet reached us, that the ship was near land, and that Providence would assist the brave. Keep where you are, added I, while I go and examine what is best to be done."
B000TU16MM1,B000TU16MM,"My children, said I to my four boys who clung to me in terrible alarm, God can save us, for nothing is impossible to him; but if he sees fit that we should not be saved, we must not murmur at his decree, but rely that what he does is most for our good; that we shall be near him in heaven, and united through eternity. Death may be well supported when it does not separate those who love.

My excellent wife wiped the tears which were falling on her cheeks, and from this moment became more tranquil; she encouraged the youngest children, who were leaning on her knees; while I, who owed them an example of firmness, was scarcely able to resist the grief which assailed my heart at the thought of what would most likely be the fate of beings so tenderly beloved. We all fell on our knees, and supplicated the God of mercy to protect us; and the emotion and the fervour of the innocent creatures are a convincing proof, that even in childhood, devotion may be felt and understood, and that its effects, tranquillity and consolation, may be no less certainly experienced.

Fritz, my eldest son, implored in a loud voice that God would deign to save his dear parents and his brothers, generously unmindful of himself: they got up with a state of mind so improved, that they seemed forgetful of the impending danger."
B005C2SOQ80,B005C2SOQ8,"The scampi tasted sweet like a lobster fed only on honey and it cut into the deep undertone of flavor deposited on the taste buds by the truffles. Shyla poured some olive oil on her fingers and licked it off. Then she poured some on my fingers and sucked the oil off them one at a time as Freddie watched with envy and approval. He honored her performance with an arugula salad, then pulled out a pocketknife, opened it, and began to undress a blood-red orange from Sicily in a patient, sacramental ceremony. The orange peel curled off the deep ruby of the fruit in a long, circular ribbon. I waited for Freddie to misjudge, but he continued to circumnavigate the orange until other patrons began to applaud. When the peel, as long as a garter snake, fell to the floor, Freddie picked it up and presented it to Shyla, who inhaled the sharp smell as Freddie divided the orange and set it before her in an immaculate arrangement, pretty as a rose. He brought glasses impressed with the image of the Pantheon and poured us both a glass of grappa.

A full moon hung over the city, and a Gypsy girl selling long-stemmed flowers moved nimbly through the diners."
B005C2SOQ81,B005C2SOQ8,"He led us to the small table outside looking out toward the Pantheon, and recommended a bottle of Barolo and a risotto for the pasta course. When he brought the risotto, he produced an elegant, razor-sharp instrument and shaved thin slices of white truffle onto the steaming hot risotto. The marriage of rice and truffle exploded in silent concordat and I shall never forget lifting the bowl to my nose and thanking God for bringing both Freddie and truffles into our life the same night.

The dinner was long and we took our time. We talked about the past and the many things that had gone wrong between us. But quickly we turned to the future and began to talk about children and what we would name them and where we would settle down and how we would raise these ethereal and beautiful McCall children who, though unborn, were already greatly beloved.

Shyla flirted with Freddie every time he came to the table and Freddie responded with a touch of both restraint and Mediterranean charm. He recommended the fresh scampi, grilled briefly, then anointed with olive oil and lemon juice. The olive oil was a deep green and looked as though it had come from a vineyard of emeralds."
B079YTRLFN0,B079YTRLFN,"Night Wind was still a new clan, rapidly growing and noticed at a planetary level. In a species that struggled with fertility, Reow had borne four living kits, all of whom had survived to adulthood, all of whom had become off-world Hunters of note in their turn. The odds of each part of that success were vanishingly small, and if that had been all that set the clan apart, still they be would be renowned.

Reow herself was an assassin in high demand; she had been the first to sigil a Human, making a pet and sponsored companion from the mercenary species, and she had taken increasingly higher value contracts over the years. Cunning Blade, as her oldest kit, had learned more by the time he’d been released from the den than many young Hunters learned their first year in the jungles.

Given all that, it was no surprise they’d been summoned to the council of elders to discuss a contract of importance to their entire species. The Governor for the Hunters had recently and unexpectedly died, and power and opportunities would always shuffle with such a significant loss. To Blade, it made utter sense that his dama would be counted as vital in a time of such movement."
B079YTRLFN1,B079YTRLFN,"Anything she’d already shed would burn away. Forcing each motion, she reached into a pouch on her belt, drew out a self-adhering bandage, and pressed it to her side so it would form around the wound. Smart enough to form around the shrapnel, too.

She didn’t waste time looking at the injury. There would be plenty of opportunity to keep herself alive on the trip home. She’d patch up enough to make it, heal a bit on the way, and get fixed in the den, with a medic she trusted and beings she loved around her. Susa would…

Flame had been drifting again, and she hissed between her teeth. Move. Commandeer ship. Home.

Target was dead, client would be happy, and she’d learn from this.

Next time would be cleaner.

* * *

Cunning Blade slept. At home, surrounded by his closest family, he allowed himself deep, boneless relaxation. He sprawled across a high perch, not a strand of fur twitching in the dim light from above.

Nothing else, not even the satisfaction after a well-planned and executed hunt, gave him the same refreshing rest, and yet he moved from sleep to alert awareness at the barest hiss of the door sliding open."
B00ONT6N0A0,B00ONT6N0A,"I am seeking information related to my father’s studies at the Technion’s Department of Architecture, his student registration file or any other relevant information. My father studied at the Technion in the early 1930s, between 1932-1935 I believe. His name was Salmon Hirsh Finkelman, though he Hebraicized his given names to Shlomo Zvi, and appears in some documents as Shlomo Hirsh Finkelman. My father died in 1958 when I was seven, so I don’t have much to go on. I’m particularly interested in finding out facts about the period of his life before he married and started a family. At your request, I’m attaching a copy of the probate which states the date of his death and the fact that I am his son and one of his beneficiaries. In that document, my name appears as Yaron Menachem Finkelman. I later Hebraicized my surname to Reshef. I am also attaching photos of my father’s first British ID, but I think it was issued a few years after his Technion days. My father arrived in Palestine on a student visa, without an ID. I can be reached by email or phone, see contact details below. Thank you in advance and have a good day, Yaron."
B00ONT6N0A1,B00ONT6N0A,", but the fourth did indeed answer to that name. When asked if he by any chance knew an architect who’d studied at the Technion, he wanted to know why I was asking. I explained that I was looking for a person who’d written a paper about my father, and he replied that, though he’d studied architecture and worked at it for a while, he dropped this occupation. Moreover, he claimed he’d never heard of my father and never wrote a seminar paper about architectural conservation in Haifa. I detected a kind of evasiveness in his voice, so I apologized for the intrusion and hung up.

About architect Silvina Sosnovsky, on the other hand, I found plenty of material. Apparently she was very active as an architecture researcher in Haifa, who focused on the location and conservation of buildings built in the 1920s-1940s. When trying to find her via the Technion, I learned that she’d retired; and after explaining my reason for seeking her out, they agreed to give me her number so I could contact her directly. Ms Sosnovsky graciously listened, took down my father’s details and suggested I call her back a few days later. I waited in suspense for a week before calling again."
B075VYCTDK0,B075VYCTDK,"But then he pulls out a cloth and a bottle from his pocket, dabs the cloth with the liquid, and holds it over my mouth. The same disgusting odor enters my nostrils … and it reminds me of the night he took me.

I struggle. I fight it, I really do. But it’s no use. Within seconds, I feel drowsy again, and my limbs don’t respond to my intentions to move. My vision is hazy, and I fade in and out of consciousness.

I can feel his hands on my wrists and legs, freeing me from the restraints. He lifts my body, holding it close to him as he carries me to the bed and lays me down.

I feel like a puppet on strings.

From the corner of my eye, I can see him walk off with the wheelchair through the door he brought me in. Too late do I regain any bit of control over my body. Too late … because the door’s already shut tightly before I can make my way to it.

I shove the dress and lipstick off me with what little energy I have then I try to clean up. I can’t even sit up straight without seeing the world revolve around me."
B075VYCTDK1,B075VYCTDK,"Why is he completely not interested in the woman right beside him? She’s the first new thing that’s happened to us since I came here, and he seems totally oblivious to her presence. As if he doesn’t care. Or as if he doesn’t feel that it’s special.

But it is. It’s a person. Someone to talk to. Someone who could help me figure out what this place is, and what Graham wants with us. Someone who could help us get out.

But I’m tired of waiting until the stranger beside me does something, so instead, I bang on the glass harder. As hard as I can. I don’t care if it keeps him awake. This is too important. I need to know who this woman is. Why she’s here. If she knows more, anything, I just have to know.

I can’t sleep knowing she’s here. Not without having at least tried to wake her up and get her to talk to me.

But my wrists feel like they’re about to fall off, that’s how painful it is. And Mr. Unknown jumps up from the bed and pounds the glass near me once, his strike so hard that it makes me jump back."
B07288H14H0,B07288H14H,"I’d never understood it when my friends talked about their work like it was a hobby until Cecily and I started our business. It never felt like work for me. I loved it. And Cecily Fragrance had been the only good in my life since my divorce. I had needed a change, to not just see the hole where my husband had been wherever I looked. Marcus walking out had rocked my world, but a drive to prove he’d made the wrong decision had lit a fire in me. It was proof to my husband that I wasn’t as predictable, boring and safe as he thought I was —he’d no doubt expected me to stay in a corporate job at an investment bank with a steady monthly salary for the rest of my career. Setting up my own business, with no structure and process unless I created it and taking a chance on getting paid every month was something he never would have thought I was capable of. And not something I’d ever imagined for myself. But when your world is on its ass, sometimes, you’ll try anything. I might not have been able to save my marriage, but I wasn’t ready to give Cecily Fragrance up."
B07288H14H1,B07288H14H,"But I just lurched from one disappointment to another disaster. I’d thought the guy last Thursday was super cute in complimenting my shoes until he confessed he liked to dress up in women’s clothes at the weekend and would like to see if my pink suede five-inch heels came in his size. Maybe I was being too picky, but I just didn’t want to fight with my boyfriend over who wore what when we went for dinner.

And then there was the guy who looked like he’d never had a haircut and didn’t look me in the eye once during our entire date. And how could I forget the forty-something, sweaty man who told our waitress she had a nice rack?

I swiped across the screen of my phone to see a text from Andrew—so far no disaster with him. We’d only had one date, and besides getting the feeling he was a neat freak, he seemed relatively normal. I wasn’t attracted to him exactly. And he hadn’t made me laugh. But he didn’t have me wanting to stab him in the eye with a fork after twenty minutes, so I’d agreed to date number two.

Looking forward to seeing you tonight."
B01N2G5Z4Z0,B01N2G5Z4Z,"Their adopted thirteen-year-old son, Scotty, asked every morning before he left for baseball camp when Dad would be home, probably because he was tired of dealing with her by himself. Freddie and the others at work had been giving her a wide berth, and even the reporters who hounded her mercilessly had backed off after she’d bitten their heads off a few too many times.

During infrequent calls from Nick, he’d been rushed and annoyed and equally out of sorts, which didn’t do much to help her bad mood. Two more days. Two more long, boring, joyless days and then he’d be home and things could get back to normal.

What did it say about her that she was actually glad to have a floater to deal with to keep her brain occupied during the last two days of Nick’s trip? It means you have it bad for your husband, and you’ve become far too dependent on him if two weeks without him turns you into a cranky cow. Sam despised her voice of reason almost as much as she despised Nick being so far away from her for so long.

Twenty minutes after receiving the call from Dispatch, Sam and Freddie made it to M Street Southeast, which was lined with emergency vehicles of all sorts—police, fire, EMS, medical examiner."
B01N2G5Z4Z1,B01N2G5Z4Z,"But Jeannie... She’d loved every second of it, and seeing her face lit up with joy had gone a long way toward alleviating Sam’s hives. After everything Jeannie had been through to get to her big day, no one was happier for her—or happier to stand up for her—than Sam. Not that she’d ever tell anyone that either. She had a reputation to maintain, after all.

She’d been in an unusually cranky mood since her husband, Nick, left for Iran two weeks ago for what should’ve been a five-day trip but had twice been extended. If he didn’t get home soon, she wouldn’t be responsible for her actions. In addition to worrying about his safety in a country known for being less than friendly toward Americans, she’d also discovered how entirely reliant upon him she’d become over the last year and a half. It was ridiculous, really. She was a strong, independent woman who’d taken care of herself for years before he’d come back into her life. So how had he turned her into a simpering, whimpering, cranky mess simply by leaving her for two damned weeks?

Naturally, the people around her had noticed that she was out of sorts."
B000FCK71U0,B000FCK71U,"I glanced around at the elders in my family. Although there are special moments when the distance of time leaves memories in shadows, the images of their faces on that day are very clear to me. My grandmother sat staring at her folded hands. Her skin was so frail and thin that I could see a blue pulse in her temple. My father, who already had plenty of aggravations, was speechless with anxiety. My aunt and uncle stood together in the main doorway, afraid to be a part of what was about to happen and afraid to miss it too. But what I remember most is my mother’s face. Of course, as a daughter I believed she was pretty, but I saw her true person for the first time that day. I had always known she had been born in the year of the monkey, but I’d never realized that its traits of deceit and cunning ran so strongly in her. Something raw lurked underneath her high cheekbones. Something conniving lay veiled behind her dark eyes. There was something … I still do not quite know how to describe it. I would say that something like male ambition glowed right through her skin."
B000FCK71U1,B000FCK71U,"So when Madame Wang’s palanquin stopped in front of our house, there was no rejoicing. Looking down from the women’s chamber, I saw neighbors come out to gape. My father kowtowed, his forehead touching the dirt again and again. I felt sorry for him. Baba was a worrier—typical for someone born in the year of the rabbit. He was responsible for everyone in our household, but this was beyond his experience. My uncle hopped from foot to foot, while my aunt—usually so welcoming and jolly—stood frozen in place at his side. From my upstairs vantage point, the conclusion was evident on all the faces below me: Something was terribly wrong.

Once they were inside, I went quietly to the top of the stairs so I could eavesdrop. Madame Wang settled herself. The tea and treats were served. My father’s voice could barely be heard as he went through the polite rituals. But Madame Wang had not come to speak trivialities with this humble family. She wanted to see me. Just as on the day before, I was called to the room. I walked downstairs and into the main room as gracefully as someone can who’s only six and whose feet are still clumsy and large."
B01EQS8YIG0,B01EQS8YIG,"Not with her body-hugging spandex, wild curls, and the energy that sparked out of her. He bet she curled up at night with trashy novels and didn’t even own a suit.

Yet the attraction for him had been instantaneous. There was power in that compact, curvy body. And that was as captivating as her physical beauty. She was strong and vibrant, making the memories of the women he’d always dated take on muted pastel shades.

She had kids. Kids meant complications, kids meant serious, neither of which Beckett was interested in. His best course of action was to avoid his new tenant as much as possible.

Beckett scrubbed his hands over his face. He needed to get out. Get a little distance from the wicked temptation in his backyard. While putting together his lunch he’d actually stood at his kitchen window for ten minutes, hoping for a glimpse of her red hair.

He scrawled his signature across a document, hit send on an email, and dropped a stack of papers on Ellery’s desk.

He’d pay his brothers a visit and check on the construction at the brewery. That would keep his thoughts from Gianna.

--------

Beckett found his brother’s girlfriend, Summer, putting groceries away in the sunny kitchen of the farmhouse."
B01EQS8YIG1,B01EQS8YIG,"He refused to attribute it to the yoga he’d endured the night before or the beautiful sadist who guided him through it. It was most likely the aftereffect of a nice, sunny vacation, he decided.

After a strong cup of coffee and his usual protein shake, Beckett decided to spend the rest of the morning catching up on work. But try as he did to focus on asset allocations for the Petrovic family and Pete McDougall’s permit request for a custard truck, he found his thoughts returning to Gianna.

He was attracted to her. There was no doubt about that. He wasn’t blind. Physically she was stunning. She was little, petite. But what she lacked in height, she made up for in sinful curves. And that face. A sprinkling of freckles on flawless ivory and green-gray eyes that always seemed to be laughing at some unspoken joke. Her wide smile warmed rooms while accentuating the sweet dimple in her chin.

He found her intriguing.

She was nothing like his usual type. The women he dated were refined, restrained even. Focused on their careers, they had an appreciation of life ’s little luxuries. They wore tailored suits and spoke fondly of Italian vacations and the literary works of Marcel Proust and Joan Didion.

Gianna did not fit neatly into that category."
B071497TTL0,B071497TTL,"It wasn’t quite a throne, but it wasn’t really a simple wooden chair either. The thing was made of a rich looking mahogany, exquisitely carved, and had a wingback which rose up over her head.

The queen’s hair was tied up in an elaborate nest of curls, braids, flowers, and ribbon decorations. A few key tresses fell from the top, and they helped accent the smoothness of the skin on her face and elegant neck. Her dress was crafted from white and lilac colored lace, and accents of cream satin material ran through the pattern to give the frills a smoothing effect. The dress was long, and although her feet were concealed beneath the fabric, I could tell that she sat with her legs crossed at the thigh.

I realized I was gawking at the woman, and I turned my eyes away from her to study her room again. I didn’t see any trace of blood on the floor from where I had slain the pirates, or where her other handmaiden had been murdered. Her staff must have done a quick job of cleaning up the place, and I kind of wondered why she didn’t have any elves with her."
B071497TTL1,B071497TTL,"I remembered I had bought a spare set of clothes in Arnicoal when I had suspected that Baron Yinnia’s men were following me, and I dug through my pack to find them.

The new suit wasn’t as nice as the dwarven made clothes, but they were clean, and smelled a tad better. I didn’t really have a mirror to check my hair, but I figured the queen probably wouldn’t care that much. I had saved her life after all.

The crew of the ship was cleaning blood from the hallway where I battled the three pirates. They gave me a word of thanks when I walked past them, and I nodded back. The bodies of the young woman’s guards were no longer in the hallway, but the blood stains hadn’t been cleaned yet, and they served as a reminder of how close we came to losing the ship.

I had been eager to log in this morning, but I had been more than a little miffed that Zarra seemed to be avoiding me. Part of me wondered if she knew about the conversation I had with Chip when we worked out. Did she know I wanted to talk to her about my strange increase in strength? Chip seemed to think all of Arnacript was bugged, but he’d also brought a noise cancellation system in his pack."
B079MHR4RT0,B079MHR4RT,"He spoke with excitement about my book, he said that it was coming out soon in Italy, too; he cited the success of the French reviews, he pointed out that I had a lot of problems with my husband and my daughters, he talked about his break with his wife, he repeated that the only solution was to live in Naples, he even encouraged her to find us a house, he asked some knowledgeable questions about her and Enzo’s work.

I listened somewhat apprehensively. His manner as he spoke was distant, to show me, first, that he really hadn’t seen Lila before; and, second, that she no longer had any influence over him. And not for an instant did he use the seductive tones that he had used with Colombe and which habitually came to him with women. He didn’t invent sentimental locutions, he never looked her straight in the eye, he didn’t touch her: his voice became a little warmer only when he praised me.

This didn’t prevent me from remembering the beach at Citara, and how he and Lila had made use of the most varied subjects to reach an understanding and cut me out. But it seemed to me that now the opposite was happening. Even when they asked each other questions and answered them, they ignored each other and addressed me, as if I were their only interlocutor."
B079MHR4RT1,B079MHR4RT,"And, just as surprisingly, she seemed affectionate toward her own parents; she said that she was putting money aside to buy the apartment where they had always lived, to give them some peace of mind. It’s a pleasure for me— she explained, as if she had to apologize for that generosity — I was born there, I’m attached to it, and if Enzo and I work hard we can afford it. She worked as much as twelve hours a day now, not only for Michele Solara but also for other clients. I’m studying— she said—a new machine, the System 32, much better than the one I showed you when you came to Acerra : it’s a white case that incorporates a tiny six-inch monitor, a keyboard, and a printer. She talked on and on about more advanced systems that were coming. She was very well informed, as usual she got excited about the new things, even though she’d be sick of them in a few days. The new machine had a beauty of its own, according to her. Too bad, she said, that apart from the machine, everything was shit.

At that point Nino broke in, and did exactly the opposite of what until that moment I had done: he began to give her detailed information."
B01N9H1TO20,B01N9H1TO2,", Mario Payday’s goon Carlo leaned up against the window and pressed his face to the glass. The young man at the table in the back certainly appeared to be Herbie Fisher. Of course, it was hard to tell with the picture he had to work with. As usual, in identifying one of Mario Payday’s new clients, Carlo had gone right to the source and checked his arrest record. Herbie had one, but his mug shot wasn’t very good. The young man in the restaurant looked a lot better than the one in the photo. Of course, at the time the photo was taken he’d just been picked up on a charge of murder, which couldn’t have helped. According to the rap sheet, he’d been charged with killing a mobster named Carmine Dattila, commonly known as Dattila the Hun. Carlo remembered the incident. The guy had marched into Dattila’s place of business and shot him twice in the head in front of a dozen witnesses. Carlo couldn’t imagine the young man at the table doing that. He couldn’t imagine anyone doing it and beating the rap. Some things, Carlo told himself, just weren’t fair.

Carlo whipped out his cell phone and called Mario."
B01N9H1TO21,B01N9H1TO2,"He looked like a corporate lawyer, which indeed he was.

Herbie Fisher, the youngest lawyer ever to make senior partner at Woodman & Weld, was a shining star, as adept at attracting clients as he was at handling their legal problems. It was hard to believe he had once been Stone’s client, and not in the most savory of cases. Were it not for Stone’s legal gymnastics, Herbie probably would have been in jail.

Stone had taken Herbie under his wing, and the young man had flourished under his mentorship. Not only had he straightened out his life, but Stone had taught him where to buy the right suits, where to get the right haircut—in short, how to be a respectable member of high society.

Since turning his life around, Herbie had never caused Stone a moment’s concern. On the contrary, he was the attorney to whom Stone was most likely to refer important clients.

At the moment Herbie was grinning from ear to ear, and the cause was undoubtedly the young woman with him. Her beauty was enough to turn any man’s head. Though as conservatively dressed as any third-grade schoolteacher, her radiant smile exuded more than a hint of mischief.

Herbie ushered her up to the table."
B071D4BGVR0,B071D4BGVR,"The old man would be waiting for his report, and he had no intention of disappointing.

Before he’d silenced his latest victims, he’d confirmed that the gunpowder was safely stored as planned, and the transfer had gone without a hitch.

He would ride into Berkshire, make his report, and then learn what the old man’s plans were for the last and final stage in his thus-far remarkably ingenious plot.

Chapter 6

By the time they reached the third address on Beam’s list, the one in Milton Avenue, Drake was exceedingly thankful that Louisa had insisted on accompanying him.

The wives of the men who had lived at the first and second addresses had been notified that morning by Scotland Yard that bodies believed to be those of their husbands had been found in alleys not far from their homes. Apparently, they’d been killed on Saturday evening, but separately, at quite different locations.

Both women had only recently returned from identifying the bodies and were in no fit state to be questioned.

Despite that, Louisa had won the trust of the females manning both doors and had learned that there was nothing known by either wives or friends of any matter that might conceivably explain the deaths."
B071D4BGVR1,B071D4BGVR,"He didn’t want anyone realizing where his latest victims worked, not until the gunpowder was well away.

But if the old man’s third stage was going to succeed—if he, Bevis Griswade, was going to make himself the old man’s sole heir —then he needed to make sure of all four men Lawton had recruited to make the critical transfer. Thank God he’d been curious enough to check on Lawton’s Monday night activities. If he hadn’t been there and seen the men’s faces, he wouldn’t know who among the large body of workers he needed to remove.

As usual, the old man’s foresight in sharing Lawton’s instructions with him smacked of near-omniscience. That, or a canny understanding that transcended the norm.

Walking steadily, he made his way back to the larger lanes. As he drew within sight of the yard gates, presently set wide, the city’s bells started pealing. Ten o’clock. The other two men would be in the yard and hard at work by now. He would have to deal with them later. Even if he had to scour the neighborhood, he would find them. He knew where they worked; they wouldn’t escape him.

Now, however, the fading echoes of the bells reminded him that he needed to be on his way."
B000FC130Y0,B000FC130Y,"The paparazzi have been on my ass all day. The painters haven’t finished in the new apartment. My limo caught on fire on East 52nd Street this afternoon, and I had to hoof it to the network through hordes of autograph-seekers. And the goddamned fucking contracts are still not ready. For this I have a business manager, a lawyer, and an agent? Also, I haven’t got the change-of-address cards done, and the ace researchers don’t have notes for me yet on the Bush interview, and What’s-his-name just called and wants to come over here right now! I am coming apart at the seams, I swear I am. As soon as he leaves, I’m going to get into a hot tub with a gigantic brandy and open a vein. I swear to God it’s just not worth it, any of it. On Monday, I have to smile into a camera and be serious, knowledgeable, and authoritative, when all I want to do with my life is to go skydiving without a parachute. Fuck the job, fuck the fame, fuck the money! Fuck everybody!!!

Skydiving without a parachute: his very thought, what, ten minutes ago? He gingerly picked up the phone again and dialed."
B000FC130Y1,B000FC130Y,"Sasha Nijinsky had not fallen— she had either jumped or been muscled over. Down below, two vehicles with flashing lights had pulled up to the scene—an ambulance and a van with SCOOP VIDEO painted on the top. As he watched, another vehicle pulled up, and a man in a white coat got out.

Stone went back into the apartment, found a switch, and flooded the room with overhead light. He looked at his watch. Two more minutes before this got official. Two objects were on the drum table besides the lamp and the phone. He unzipped her purse and emptied it onto the table. The usual female rubbish—makeup of all sorts, keys, a small address book, safety pins, pencils, credit cards held together with a rubber band, and a thick wad of money, held with a large gold paper clip. He counted it: twelve hundred and eleven dollars, including half a dozen hundreds. The lady didn’t travel light. He looked closely at the gold paper clip. Cartier.

Stone turned to the other object: a red-leather book with the word DIARY stamped in gold. He went straight to the last page, today’s date.

Hassle, hassle, hassle. The moving men are giving me a hard time."
B01BAWSUNK0,B01BAWSUNK,"Sean flying out with Dad chasing after him, clutching something in his hand. Dad reaching Sean. Thrusting something square at him. A photo. The one Sean couldn’t find. The last one, when we’d been confident and carried away. When we’d stopped laughing when the self-timer went off. When we’d worked out how to balance the camera on a pile of LPs and tilt it at an angle so the picture got our whole bodies in. Where Sean had one hand on my breast and another spreading my legs.

The only photo where you could see everything.

There was a pause. Then Dad’s cufflinks glittering in the May sunshine, the tie with the school crest flapping back over his shoulder, the crack as he drove his fist into Sean’s face. Sean grunting and buckling over. Dad’s foot, clad in a highly polished shoe, making contact with Sean’s ribs. A shout. Mr Shaw, our pale Geography teacher, scattering papers as he ran. Sean on the floor, curled up, hands covering his head. Mr Shaw’s thin fingers clawing onto Dad’s arm.

The disbelief on Dad’s face.

On everybody’s.

Even now, my feeling of terror could reignite, like trick candles on a birthday cake.

My mother’s voice took on a rasping harshness."
B01BAWSUNK1,B01BAWSUNK,"Well, you’re only thirteen’ comments when I’d been shocked at things he’d done with his friends – drinking on the dunes, nicking sweets from Woolworths, banging the machines in the amusement arcades to make the coins rattle out. I didn’t dare say anything more and turned my attention to not being late for Maths with the terrifying Mr Ashcombe. I was trying to hurry without Sean noticing. He was hell-bent on dawdling back, blasé, even though he was in my dad’s French class straight after lunch. In the end, the fear of Mr Ashcombe shouting at me in front of everyone was too strong. I needed to fetch my books from my locker, so I raced on ahead.

When I emerged back out into the playground, my dad was disappearing into his class as the second bell rang for the start of lessons. So he wouldn’t catch me cutting it fine to get to class on time, I hung back behind a pillar a few yards away. I watched him open his textbook, then pick up something inside it and study it closely. I was just about to duck past when Sean strolled round the corner.

He winked as he opened the classroom door."
B00BMKFPUC0,B00BMKFPUC,"He was dressed in corduroys and a tweed jacket and a thick grey polo-necked sweater, and draped around his neck was an extremely long and startlingly striped woollen scarf. He had hair that was no particular colour, neither fair nor brown, and it was rather untidy and looked as though it needed a good cut. She could not see the colour of his eyes because he was reading, but he wore heavy horn-rimmed spectacles and there was a deep cleft, too masculine to be called a dimple, bang in the middle of his chin. She wondered how old he was and decided about twenty-five. But perhaps she was wrong. She hadn’t much experience of young men, and it was hard to be sure.

She turned back to the window. In a moment they would be going over the Saltash Bridge, and she didn’t want to miss the sight of all the naval men-of-war at anchor in the harbour.

But Jess had other thoughts. She was already bored with looking out of the window, and now searched for some different diversion. She began to jump up and down, and then scrambled down off the seat in order to be able to scramble up again. In doing so her shoe kicked Judith’s shin, quite painfully."
B00BMKFPUC1,B00BMKFPUC,"that she had time to regret the absence of Uncle Bob.

It was horrid going without saying goodbye to him. It was her own fault, for being so late coming down to breakfast, but it would have been nice if he could have waited, just five minutes, and said goodbye properly. And she wanted to thank him for so much, and thanks were never the same written in a letter.

The best had been his gramophone. Despite her mother’s girlhood yearnings to go on the stage and become a ballerina, neither she nor Dad were musically inclined, but those afternoons spent with Uncle Bob in his study had awakened an awareness, an appreciation the existence of which Judith had never even suspected. He owned a huge variety of records, and although she had much enjoyed the Gilbert and Sullivan songs with their witty lyrics and catchy tunes, there were others which had lifted her heart, or made her feel so poignantly sad that she could scarcely keep the tears from brimming into her eyes. Puccini arias from La Bohème, the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto, Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet music. And, sheerest magic, Rimski-Korsakov’s Scheherazade, the solo violin sending shivers down her spine."
B078W3TXTS0,B078W3TXTS,"Plus, the row of motorcycles constantly lining the curb is starting to become intimidating for some of our regulars.

And of course, there’s also the fact that the shop is run by satan himself—Clinton Alvarez. Lean muscles, brooding eyes and sinful hair I sort of want to slide my fingers through but ultimately, a vile person.

This used to be a good town. A place where people raised their children without a second thought about security, a place where people forgot to lock their doors because they felt so safe. Now all of a sudden Copper Heights is being taken over by sketchy, leather-loving motorcycle guys with broken noses. The real estate value of this town has probably plunged 50 percent in the two weeks since the Rusty Razor opened its doors. Okay, maybe I’m being overdramatic but come on! The situation is really starting to get me hot under the collar.

Sadie—who fails to understand that her job description does not include performing impromptu song and dance routines for the customers —wiggles her butt in time with the obnoxiously loud rock music as she boxes up some donuts for a mean-looking biker with a freshly-coiffed Mohawk. She bats her eyes at him and speaks in a low, flirty voice.

This is just pure treachery."
B078W3TXTS1,B078W3TXTS,"I grit my teeth as I scrub the damp rag over the already-clean counter. It’s all I can do to keep from screaming.

Loud heavy metal music drowns out the smooth easy listening tunes animating the cupcake shop. The photos on the wall jump in their frames as the whole room vibrates. The barbershop’s speakers are definitely right on the other side of this wall.

Through very meticulous customer profile analysis, I was able to determine that the Broken Cupcake’s ideal customer is a college-aged single female in search of a quiet place to enjoy a warm drink and a sweet treat while trying to study for midterms or complete school assignments. It’s all clearly spelled out in our business plan. So we do our best to keep the atmosphere of the bakery comfortable and laid-back, with low, relaxing music and mellow, calming scents. But ever since the Rusty Razor Barbershop opened up next door, our feng shui has gone to hell in a hand basket.

Yesterday, I witnessed a three-man brawl in the parking lot right outside the front window. Then, there was that hulking degenerate who scared me senseless when I walked in on him peeing against the side of the building while I was taking out the trash last night."
B0093UMLC80,B0093UMLC8,"His worst punishment was to sit a pupil near a blackboard with his crime chalked on it and beneath the school puppet Bondybunda. Unsurprisingly he was the bane of the local educational authority, though he was loved by the children and came to be respected by their parents. It was a shock for all of them when in 1967, at the age of 55, he suddenly retired to write novels.

He had already published one novel, a contrapuntal revenge melodrama called A Day in Summer (1964), somewhat reminiscent of Patrick Hamilton’s retributive thrillers, and had saved £1,600 to buy time for writing. But this was a difficult period. In 1968 his wife was diagnosed with lung cancer and, though this intermittently went into recession, it was to kill her thirteen years later—after which Carr added to the 1991 edition of A Month in the Country the poignant epigraph by the Irish poet Herbert Trench.

In his charming, but not quite definitive, twenty-eight-page pamphlet The Life and Times of J.L. Carr, Byron Rogers writes that by 1969 Carr had only £200 left, but rescued himself by printing and selling county maps which were illumined with his teasing wit, arcane knowledge, and artistic talent."
B0093UMLC81,B0093UMLC8,"Having twice failed his eleven-plus examination, which would have qualified him for free Grammar School entry, he was sent as a paying pupil to Castleford Secondary School (which the sculptor Henry Moore had attended), then went to the Dudley Teacher Training College, after which he taught in several schools in Birmingham. For one improbable year he traveled to the United States and, on an exchange system, taught children on the Great Plains of South Dakota—an episode that eventually led to his novel The Battle of Pollock ’s Crossing (1985), an eccentric offshoot of David Lodge ’s Changing Places. During the Second World War, he joined the Royal Air Force and served in Sierra Leone, using some of his experiences in his novel A Season in Sinji (1967), where he opposes the madness of warfare with the intricate sanity of cricket (a game that, in the opinion of Bernard Shaw, had given the otherwise atheistic English nation a sense of eternity).

After the war Carr married the daughter of an Essex farmer. They had a son and in 1951 moved to Kettering in Northamptonshire, where he became a legendary headmaster. His initiatives, which enrich his novel The Harpole Report, were famously unorthodox. He would ask the children to put their names and addresses in bottles, then collectively launch them into the fast-flowing river; or organize an Arithmetic Race in which contestants, running along the course, were obliged to stop at various blackboards, set out across the field, and solve equations."
B00AHFJAAO0,B00AHFJAAO,"Then I’d have to thank him in person.

Get it over with, Charlie would say to me. Always good to do the shit stuff fast, get it out of the way.

Charlie, as ever (if he’d been there but, unfortunately, he was not), was right.

I sighed, threw Max’s T-shirt on the armchair, and dumped my toiletries in my bag. On bare feet I walked to the spiral staircase and descended.

When I hit the living room, I saw him standing at the stove, his back to me. He was wearing another thermal, no flannel this time. It was wine-colored and it fit him perfectly. Maybe a bit too perfectly. You could even see some of his muscles defined through the shirt and there appeared to be a lot of them. He was again wearing faded jeans. The waves of his thick hair at the back were just as perfect as they were from the front. Maybe even more perfect. Maybe even his hair was the definition of perfection.

I was five feet from the bar when he turned, fork in hand.

His gray eyes hit me. They did a sweep from head to toe and back again; he smiled and I stopped moving."
B00AHFJAAO1,B00AHFJAAO,"They were faded and there was a tear in the back pocket, the threads bleached white, and I thought they looked hip. They also fit like they were made for me and they made my somewhat generous behind look good. Therefore, I loved them.

I paired them with a wide tan belt and my lilac, long-sleeved T-shirt that had fitted sleeves so long they came over my wrists and had a boatneck that was so wide sometimes it fell off my shoulder.

I gathered all my stuff and walked out of the bathroom, smelled bacon cooking, and saw that the dirty sheets had been taken away.

I closed my eyes slowly.

I should probably not have taken time to strip the bed, though that would have been rude.

And maybe I should have left out lotioning and, probably, standing under the strong, hot spray of the shower for a full five minutes, just letting the water wash over me and bring me back to life.

Well, Max was home and I had no choice —I’d have to thank him in person. No, I’d have to face him, tall, amazing-looking, gravel-voiced Max Whatever-His-Last-Name-Was who had seen me mostly naked and took care of me while I was sick."
B00HYMDS9M0,B00HYMDS9M,"Thinking, If we just get through this phase with its SIDS and spiking fevers and odd diseases, you’ll be OK, and I won’t ever have to worry like this again.

But peril pressed in at the edges of a girl’s life, and worry planted roots in Rath’s heart and bloomed wild and reckless. As Rachel had grown, Rath’s worry had grown, and he’d kept vigilant for the lone man who stood with his hands jammed in his trouser pockets behind the playground fence. In public, Rath had gripped Rachel’s hand fiercely, his love ferocious and animal.

If anyone ever did anything to her.

Chapter 4

THE MISSING GIRL’S metallic brown 1989 Monte Carlo was parked at a strange angle. Its trunk was backed up to the side of a dilapidated hay barn, so close to the road that the nose of the Monte Carlo jutted out into the soft shoulder.

Rath stood at the road’s edge with Grout to study the scene.

A logging truck howled past with a load of cedar logs, its horn wailing as it kicked up a wind that ruffled Rath’s thatch of black hair.

Rath spit road grit from his mouth and pulled the collar of his Johnson wool coat up around his neck.

Grout blew his nose into a red bandana."
B00HYMDS9M1,B00HYMDS9M,"Older sister to a sole sibling whose presence would have prevented the murder if he’d been on time as promised, but, as always, had failed to be, just like their old man. Laura’s only sibling, her younger brother.

Frank Rath.

Rath shivered, that day as alive and crawling inside him now as then. Nothing dulled the guilt or the loss. Not even his deep love for the baby girl.

Rachel.

At the moment Rath had picked Rachel up from her crib, he’d felt an abrupt shift within him, a permanent upheaval like one plate of the Earth ’s lithosphere slipping beneath another; his selfish past life subducting beneath a selfless future life, a deep rift created in him, altering his inner landscape. A niece transformed into a daughter by acts of violent cruelty.

For six months after the murder, Rath had kept Rachel’s crib beside his bed and lain sleepless each night as he’d listened to her frayed breathing, her every sigh and whimper. He’d panicked when she’d fallen too quiet, shaken her lightly to make certain she was alive, been flooded with relief when she’d wriggled in her swaddle. He’d picked her up and cradled her to him as she’d broken into the loneliest cry he’d ever heard, her baby heart pattering as he’d promised to keep her safe."
B079MH71DF0,B079MH71DF,"Not just kiss him, but throw herself at him in a most un-Roma way.

The market tilted and swayed around her. She kicked her chair upright and plopped into it again, remembering the way they’d looked at each other in her vision. It wasn’t just the excitement of a new relationship or the possibility of a future together. He’d seen her as something precious—like she was everything that mattered to him. And she had kissed him with an openness, a complete trust she’d never experienced before. And there was something else hovering between them during the kiss, something Ember still detected in her father’s eyes whenever he looked at her mother’s photograph.

Love.

She shook her head. Her gift had betrayed her. That man would climb back onto his ship and go back to wherever he’d come from, and Ember would go home and care for her father. Eventually, when her father was better and didn’t need her anymore, she’d fall in love with a respectable Rom man. She’d forget about the outsider by next week.

She had enough money for Dai’s medicine now. The next bottle would last him two more months—plenty of time to recover. This was definitely her day.

As the crowd dispersed, the officer stepped forward."
B079MH71DF1,B079MH71DF,"Movement caught her eye as a group in silver uniforms made their way down the aisle toward her. Ember’s heart sank. Definitely soldiers. One had an unusually large chin, and his black uniform was littered with colorful patches and ribbons. His build, chiseled and hard, was the type that required hours of work each week. One look at the man’s eyes made Ember shiver.

The crowd parted to let them through. The man in black led his soldiers straight for her, then they stopped behind Stefan as if to watch.

Panic rose inside her. Did this man know she hadn’t paid homage? Would they take any money she earned today?

She forced herself to breathe normally, to think clearly. If she had to, she’d pay homage out of the two hundred credits. She’d still have just enough for Dai’s medicine.

Ember took a deep breath and closed her eyes, feeling the weight of two dozen eyes on her. Once again, she reached out internally and plunged into the light.

Ember stared at him with her lips slightly parted, her beautiful, dark eyes wide in surprise. A strand of her wild black hair hung over face, and he longed to brush it aside. But he didn’t dare, not until he knew how she felt."
B073X1YZ3H0,B073X1YZ3H,"It was inevitable when you had a zoo full of animals with lots of food stored and left lying around by the animals that you had the rat problem to go with it. That was what had attracted the cats. Since they’d appeared, the zoo had always semi-looked after them, providing ample food to keep them going in case they had a bad night’s hunting. I liked to think that whoever’s job it had been to look after them before I arrived had also kept an eye on their health and taken any that looked to be in the wars to the vet. Just like any family, the cats didn’t always get along, especially as they were a constantly changing group. Sometimes a tomcat or two would wander in and I would be responsible for scraping the loser off the floor the day after the fight to get seen to by the vet. After having their war wounds patched up, the toms would also wake up missing a couple of things. Thus, hopefully curbing both their natural male cat aggression and their ability to produce unwanted litters.

It wasn't always this easy. Often a feral cat with a grievous injury could still be the devil to catch. These weren’t house pets, they were wild animals and I had the scars to prove it."
B073X1YZ3H1,B073X1YZ3H,"It wasn’t long before I’d finished the evening feed and found it was only one hour after my official finishing time.

I returned the last set of plastic bowls to the food store, but didn’t exit back into the main zoo. Instead, I walked through into the main storeroom, where we kept large quantities of any food that could be stored for a length of time. Dry food and freezers full of all sorts of emergency supplies (in case anything ever happened to cut the zoo off) filled what was essentially a miniature warehouse. I reached exterior door, where deliveries were made, and used my keys to open it. Usually, keys for this door were kept back in the office and only used for deliveries, but this task meant I had been permitted special dispensation.

As well as looking after exotic animal species, the zoo had some behind-the-scenes residents that I liked to check on. There was a hay barn a little way behind the zoo, sitting on the field the warehouse backed on to. The larger, grass-eating animals were often put out to graze in these fields, but I was here to visit our only furry members of staff.

No one remembered when the cats had arrived."
B079RN8FCD0,B079RN8FCD,"Her reaction was delayed, as if she didn’t think the hug was real, that I was real. But then her uncuffed hands slid around me and she squeezed my body hard enough to make me wince. My muscles were sore from two rounds in the lab and getting tossed around my cell like a ragdoll, but I didn’t care.

Preta was alive.

She quipped about accommodations, and room service towel swans when I pulled away before clasping her to my person again. I rolled my eyes to the dark canopy above, annoyed and relieved, because there was clearly a piece of my sister still inside the harrowingly unhealthy body I was hugging.

I shook my head, dismissing her endearing—yet silly—so-Preta-like questions after lifting my arms from around her and taking a step back.

For a small moment in time, she joked, and made me laugh, my gut hurting in a way it hadn’t since the last time I saw her on Earth. It filled a void in my being I hadn’t realized was there.

A hand closed over my shoulder, squeezing and yanking me away from Preta. Our moment ended in a rush as our current situation came crashing down around us."
B079RN8FCD1,B079RN8FCD,"My confused mind was bombarded with sights and smells I didn’t recognize.

This wasn’t Earth.

Or it wasn’t a part of Earth I had ever seen. That couldn’t be though. I had been to every continent Earth had, thanks to Project Nomad. There wasn’t this much vegetation left... well, anywhere.

The trees soaring high above us, topped with lush canopies—highlighted by the blinding spotlights strategically planted around the perimeter—reminded me of depictions I’d seen of prehistoric Earth when dinosaurs roamed.

Where was the smog? The constant hum of people and machinery?

No place was this quiet.

Darkness blanketed everything around the ship where the spotlights didn’t illuminate the forest. The deadly silence beyond the low thrum of the generators trying to power what remained of the ship, and the occasional sniffle and shuffle from the few inmates and guards, were enough to raise the hair at the nape of my neck.

We had crashed. The turned-up soil and charred debris trailing the ship further beyond the perimeter that I could see spoke to that.

Crashed where?

I turned my head, realizing only a piece of the ship was here. The alpha pod I’d been housed in.

Handsy shoved me again."
B00VOYGYNS0,B00VOYGYNS,"He was clearly on the move, and I had to assume the same would hold true for many other names on the list since I had started to pick off vampires via Fae mercenaries. Once word got out that this binder had been stolen, they would move for sure. So if it were to be of any use, I would have to move quickly, before they knew I had this. A USB drive with a file on it would have been more convenient, but since I was sure the idea was to make everything inconvenient for hackers and keep the speed of technology on their side, they had saved a hard copy only.

The two who would hear about it first and perhaps spread the word were the safety deposit box’s owners: the ancient vampire Theophilus and the arcane lifeleech, Werner Drasche. The latter was most likely in Ethiopia where I’d left him, swearing in German and arranging a flight to Toronto. Theophilus, I knew, wouldn’t be traveling across an ocean to chase me.

I flipped to the T’s but found no entry there for Theophilus. Damn. Either he was using a different name or wasn’t listed here at all."
B00VOYGYNS1,B00VOYGYNS,"I answered him mentally since I didn’t want Ed or his friend to worry about my sanity if they saw me talking out loud to my hound.

< But I thought it would be Canadian bacon! Aren’t we in Canada? >

Yes, but maybe you were trying to be too clever there. People in Canada do not call that kind of meat Canadian bacon, the same way people in Belgium do not call their waffles Belgian waffles.

< Well, it’s still good. Thanks. >

I snarfed the donut and slurped up some coffee and then pulled out the cause of all the trouble: a binder full of names and addresses, many of them international. There was no handy title page announcing their significance, but they were alphabetized, and I flipped to the H’s. There I found an entry for Leif Helgarson, providing his former location in Arizona. It told me two things: This was, as I’d hoped, a directory of every vampire in the world, stored offline and therefore unhackable. But it was also months out of date at the very least. Leif had still nominally been the vampire lord of Arizona’s sun-kissed humans around the time of Granuaile’s binding to the earth, but he’d shown up twice in Europe since then—once in Greece and once in France. Germany too, if I counted a handwritten note."
B01BGTYZU40,B01BGTYZU4,"It was a sad smile, like she felt sorry for him.

And what the hell was that? A year and a half of grief counseling at the community center and he gets a dead ex-wife taunting him every few minutes with a spike of shame?

He twisted the volume knob and let the reedy timbre of Jerry Garcia fill his ears.

Chapter 4

At 3:30 Wolf had still not gotten the X-rays he needed. In fact, nobody had seen him at all. For all the millions of dollars pumped into the new county building down in Rocky Points, one would’ve thought they could’ve put in a measly X-ray machine. Instead, he was thirty miles south, sitting in the disinfectant air of the County Hospital, listening to the buzzing lights overhead.

He scraped the metal chair across the linoleum floor, took off his sock, and propped his foot up on the examination table. Folding his arms, he closed his eyes, and with a steady tingle the blood drained away from his ankle. Fatigue from the long day had fully set in and he was starting to rehearse fight moves in his head, a good sign that he was in a bad mood."
B01BGTYZU41,B01BGTYZU4,"The song brought back memories of his own senior year of high school, when he enjoyed blue-sky days like this, when the only care in the world on a Friday afternoon was who was going to get the beer that night, and from whom, and where they were going to drink it, and then when he and Sarah were going to get some alone time.

The memories seemed of centuries past. Lately Wolf’s only alone moments with anyone were with Jet, the German shepherd Jack had adopted and left for Wolf to take care of most of the time, a dog who was probably lazing in a cloud of his own gas in the living room about now.

The Lone Wolf, Judy Fleming had called him. He was fine being alone if the alternative was aggressive, meaningless sex with a woman who had a hollow heart. He should have never agreed to that drink with her two months ago, and he definitely shouldn’t have drunk as much as he had, which had ended with him between the sheets with her.

That next morning, waking up in her over-soft bed, watching her study him with a triumphant smile while she slipped on her pantsuit, Wolf had never felt so ashamed of himself. Sure, he’d gotten laid, but at what cost? The woman was the town bicycle and she seemed proud of it, courting men in public like it was part of her job description. He deserved better than that.

Sarah smiled at him in his mind’s eye."
B00JNQKQOM0,B00JNQKQOM,"And an immortal black-skinned witch with dark magic from the veins of the Earth at her command.

Let’s not forget that one, Archidi.

She found Menith Tand sat at a table in one corner of the otherwise empty tavern bar, flanked by two of his mercenary crew and playing out a deck of cards in some version of solitaire she didn’t know. If he was concerned about the path of recent events, it didn’t show. Lamps had been lit for him against the late afternoon gloom, and in the light they cast, his narrow features were composed to the point of boredom. She saw he’d recently had a shave, and his ostentatiously undyed gray hair was gathered back on either side of his head with twinned clips the color of ivory—carved, so the rumor went, from the bones of an escaped slave. He met Archeth’s eye as she came through the tavern door and nodded, then leaned back in his chair to speak with one of his men. As she approached the table, the man stepped forward and for a moment her pulse ratcheted up. But the mercenary just made a clumsy bow and set out the chair opposite Tand for her to sit down."
B00JNQKQOM1,B00JNQKQOM,"THEY HAD SHENDANAK LAID OUT ON THE BED IN HIS ROOMS. GRIM-FACED Majak cousins lined the narrow corridor outside and took up space on the stairs, bulky and damp-smelling in their felt coats and boots. Shouldering her way up past them, Archeth caught impassive stares and muttered snatches of conversation in the steppe tongue. Covert warding gestures forked in her direction, hands touched to talisman purses. Here and there, she saw the glint of a knife being used—for now—to pick at nails or teeth.

There was an ugly, purposeful quiet to it all, and it kicked her straight back to the war. Armed men, waiting for violence to ensue.

At the top of the stairs, one of the cousins rocked to his feet and got in her face, berating her loudly until two of his companions forced him to sit back down. She couldn’t decipher any of what he said; her understanding of the various Majak dialects was limited to a handful of Skaranak phrases Egar had taught her over the years. But she didn’t really need a translator.

She masked her misgivings, kept her hands well away from the hilts of her own knives, and rapped sharply at the door. Rakan opened for her."
B078CY39DH0,B078CY39DH,"He breathed out a sigh of relief, glad to know his friend was already on it, and hopped out of the car, slamming it behind him. He wasn't sure what to expect, but he was glad he wasn't going to be alone in this.

Chapter Twenty-Three

Willow wished she were alone.

Officer Keech had dragged her in through the house, warning her not to scream. The second he stopped his police cruiser, he opened the back door and slammed her against the grate, using her shock as a chance to slip handcuffs on her. He had a gun in his holster and a grimace on his usually kind face. The house was large – three stories, somewhere between a Victorian house and a modern one with the decor. The power was out, probably since the owners went missing and couldn't foot the bill anymore, and it added to the horror of the situation.

Family pictures lined the hall he pushed her down, each face echoing back the 'missing person' reports. She realized where she was and dread filled her like a thick sludge, coating her heart and mind.

What the fuck?

Willow started kicking again, wanting to run, wanting to escape, and he knocked her to the ground, dragging her by the handcuffs around her wrists."
B078CY39DH1,B078CY39DH,"A car behind him honked at him for slowing down, and he waved an apology and kept driving. The forest started in around him as he drove into the other side of town than he lived. He started recognizing the familiar path. It had only been a week since he'd been there last.

He was heading to the Wells' home.

A road was coming up, his next turn, and he knew to turn there before the voice even said it.

Carter chewed the inside of his cheek and tried to think about what he expected to see.

Why would she be out there?

Had she gone on her own? Was she taken there?

Was the family still alive and trying to convince her into leaving, too?

He felt like a conspiracy theorist, letting the ideas and plots and questions grate away at him like sandpaper.

He was tired of feeling guilty, tired of feeling useless. He knew it was in part his fault that the Alphas kept vanishing, but he knew that whomever took them was also to blame. Guilt wasn't going to help him find her, and it wasn't going to change the situation at hand.

When he pulled up to the house, finally, James' police car was outside."
B01IWJWAZS0,B01IWJWAZS,"She bit violently into a cookie, remembering the blonde with the watermelon-sized rack.

The idea that he’d come back for her was…unsettling, confusing.

They’d gone eight years without contact. When he came home for sporadic, infrequent visits, she made herself scarce. And that included John Pierce’s funeral. Joey’s father had taken her decision not to attend the services as a sign that she’d finally gotten over it all.

What her father didn’t know was that while everyone else in town was at the funeral, Joey snuck into the farmhouse and cleaned it from top to bottom leaving behind a few million calories of baked goods to help feed the flood of visitors that Phoebe would face in the following days.

But things were different, now. Phoebe was happily engaged to the charming Franklin. Carter and Summer had made the farmhouse their home. And Jax was back, professing the things that her heart had yearned for years ago. But it was too late.

Wasn’t it?

Too little, too late. And without answers to her whys, there was no altering her course. Her heart would remain closed where Jax was concerned, she decided, even as she bagged up four cookies and tucked them away."
B01IWJWAZS1,B01IWJWAZS,"Jax’s favorite and as a kid, once she realized that, she always made sure to set aside a bag just for him. She bit her lip, considered. What harm would setting aside one baggie do? It would be her secret stash in case the girls inhaled the rest of them. Or she could save them and give them to Jax.

Their fight at the brewery played in her head on a constant loop. And so had the feelings that it had dredged up. She’d gotten so used to her simmering animosity and unavoidable, uncontrollable physical attraction. But she’d forgotten about all the other long-buried feelings associated with Jackson Pierce.

It’s all for you. I came back for you.

His words, earnest and angry, rolled through her head.

What the hell had changed? And why now? She’d spent the last eight years moving on, building a safe, manageable life. Sure, she’d refused on principle to watch any of the movies he’d written. She’d done her best to put Jax out of her head and heart. Of course, she’d slipped a few times over the years and did a little online research. He’d certainly moved on, many times over. A different woman on his arm at every event."
B07B68J3PY0,B07B68J3PY,"She wished to fly, to rush into the sea, to fling her body upon the ground, to hold all things in her arms and make them one with herself. There was an enormous hunger in her which had no name, no lineaments, no shape, no form, but which devoured her and moved her, at times, to weeping. She longed for embraces from all that she saw and heard. A butterfly, as red as blood, blew like a rose petal onto her knee and while she gazed at it her eyes filled with tears. It was not only the beauty of the insect which caused her heart to beat wildly. It was its very existence, and the enigma of its existence. She was overcome with adoration, but for what she did not know.

Behind her the pillared house with its painted frescoes seemed formed of white fire and appeared to float rather than to rest on the ground. Then there was the sound of lutes and singing, and she rose, trembling, and tried to compose herself, for now she must go to the room of the physician, who taught the maidens what they must know of the arts of healing.

She looked at the sky and whispered impetuously,"
B07B68J3PY1,B07B68J3PY,"She had already forgotten her unfortunate teacher. She had some time before she entered another classroom as a pupil. She lifted her delicate hands and let the sunlight stream through them, marveling at their sudden translucence and the rosy blood at their margins. What a wondrous thing was this world and all in it! A blade of grass, a stone, a leaf, held glories and mysteries beyond the words of any poet or philosopher. There was no common thing; nothing was gray or dull or lifeless or without beauty, but all shone with an inner splendor and astonishment at their own being. Nothing could be adequately explained or understood; nothing could be fully known. Therein lay the most profound of excitements, and amazements. She examined a lock of her hair, feeling its silken texture, its living presence. But, what was it in truth besides its seeming? What deeper reality was there behind what could be felt, tasted, heard, seen or touched?

Her thoughts were still childish and full of wonder, but her intensity was not childlike, nor the passion that rose in her nubile breast when contemplating all that existed. She was seized with restlessness, and she suddenly clenched her hands together to restrain her fervor."
B004AM5QYY0,B004AM5QYY,"Well, of course not if you were taking two milligrams of Xanax every four hours on top of all this other crap! That’s how they’d shut down Deirdre’s powers, drugging her. Oh, so many opportunities had passed by. Well, this opportunity wouldn’t.

And what was this cute little bottle, Elavil? That had a sedative effect too, didn’t it? And wow, what a dose. It’s a wonder Michael had been able to come downstairs tonight. And to think he’d held her on his shoulders for Comus. Poor guy. This was damn near sadistic.

She touched his cheek lightly. Very clean-shaven. He didn’t wake. Another long deep breath came out of him, almost a yawn, sounding very male.

She knew she could wake him, however, he wasn’t in a coma after all, and then the most disturbing thought came to her! She’d been with David already tonight! Damn! It had been safe, sanitary but still messy. She couldn’t wake Michael, not till she’d sunk down into a nice warm bath.

Hmmm. And she hadn’t even thought of that till now. Her clothes were still soiled. That was the whole trouble with being thirteen. Your brilliance was uneven. You forgot enormous things! Even Alicia had told her that."
B004AM5QYY1,B004AM5QYY,"Ought to do you a big favor and throw this junk in the garbage for you, she thought. What you need is Mayfair Witches’ Brew. When she got home, she’d look up all these drugs in one of the big pharmaceutical books she had in her library. Ah, look, Xanax. That could make anyone into a zombie. Why give him that four times a day? They’d taken Xanax away from her mother, because Alicia took it in handfuls with her wine and her beer.

Hmmm, this did feel like a very unlucky room. She liked the fancy decorative work above the windows, and the chandelier, but it was an unlucky room. And that smell was in here too.

Very faint, but it was here, the delicious smell, the smell that didn’t belong in the house, and had something to do with Christmas.

She came close to the bed, which was very high like so many old-fashioned beds, and she looked at Uncle Michael lying there, his profile deep in the snow-white cotton cover of the down pillow, dark lashes and eyebrows surprisingly distinct. Very much a man, just a smidgen more testosterone and you would have had a barrel-chested ape with bushy eyebrows. But there had not been the smidgen. Perfection had been the result."
B006BAEQB20,B006BAEQB2,"and I think how wonderful it must be to be a man and put your initial on a command and know that at once, such a thing is done. I would send out commands all day just for the pleasure of it.

He looks up and sees us as the clerk takes the papers away, and Father makes a little beckoning gesture. We go forwards and curtsey as we should, while my father raises his hand in blessing, and then he pushes back his chair and calls us around the table so that we can stand before him. He puts out his hand to me and I go close and he pats my head, like he pats Midnight, his horse. This is not a particularly nice feeling for he has a heavy hand, and I am wearing a cap of stiff golden net that he crushes down with each pat, but he does not summon Isabel any closer. She has to stand rather awkwardly, looking at the two of us, so I turn to her and smile because our father’s hand is on me, and it is me who is leaning against the arm of his chair as if I am comfortable to be here, rather than alarmed at these signs of his favor."
B006BAEQB21,B006BAEQB2,"My father is here to dispense justice, and while he sits in the great hall, settling quarrels and hearing petitions, Isabel and I and my father’s wards including Richard, the king’s brother, are allowed to go out riding every afternoon. We go hunting for pheasant and grouse with our falcons on the great moors that stretch for miles, all the way to Scotland. Richard and the other boys have to work with their tutors every morning but they are allowed to be with us after dinner. The boys are the sons of noblemen, like Francis Lovell, some the sons of great men of the North who are glad of a place in my father’s household, some cousins and kin to us who will stay with us for a year or two to learn how to rule and how to lead. Robert Brackenbury, our neighbor, is a constant companion to Richard, like a little squire to a knight. Richard is my favorite, of course, as he is now brother to the King of England. He is no taller than Isabel but furiously brave, and secretly I admire him. He is slight and dark-haired, utterly determined to become a great knight, and he knows all the stories of Camelot and chivalry which he sometimes reads to me as if they were accounts of real people.

He says to me then, so seriously that I cannot doubt him:"
B000FC1PB60,B000FC1PB6,"Thirty yards away, Baker saw the rim of an arroyo, a ravine cut into the landscape. The footprints seemed to come from there.

So he followed the footsteps back to the arroyo, stood at the edge, and looked down into it. There was no car. He saw nothing but a snake, slithering away from him among the rocks. He shivered.

Something white caught his eye, glinting in the sunlight a few feet down the slope. Baker scrambled down for a better look. It was a piece of white ceramic about an inch square. It looked like an electrical insulator. Baker picked it up, and was surprised to find it was cool to the touch. Maybe it was one of those new materials that didn’t absorb heat.

Looking closely at the ceramic, he saw the letters ITC stamped on one edge. And there was a kind of button, recessed in the side. He wondered what would happen if he pushed the button. Standing in the heat, with big boulders all around him, he pushed it.

Nothing happened.

He pushed it again. Again nothing.

Baker climbed out of the ravine and went back to the car. The old guy was sleeping, snoring loudly. Liz was looking at the maps."
B000FC1PB61,B000FC1PB6,"ATT and other companies soon followed, as did universities such as Cal Tech, and government facilities like Los Alamos. And so did a New Mexico research company called ITC. Located only an hour’s drive from Los Alamos, ITC made remarkable strides very early in the decade. Indeed, it is now clear that ITC was the first company to have a practical, working application employing advanced quantum technology, in 1998.

In retrospect, it was a combination of peculiar circumstances—and considerable luck —that gave ITC the lead in a dramatic new technology. Although the company took the position that their discoveries were entirely benign, their so-called recovery expedition showed the dangers only too clearly. Two people died, one vanished, and another suffered serious injuries. Certainly, for the young graduate students who undertook the expedition, this new quantum technology, harbinger of the twenty-first century, proved anything but benign.

B01IP11LTY0,B01IP11LTY,"With fierce concentration, he slid his arms and legs through the harness, cinching a belt around his waist.

By the time he finished, the airship moved away with unbelievable velocity like the fabled UFOs of legend, seeming to defy normal physics. One thing was clear. The Visionary wasn’t going to rescue Shu. If the Provost Marshal were going to live, he would have to do something about it.

Maddox gauged the distance to Shu and then to the ground. He didn’t have much time left. Without further thought, he swept his arms to his sides, shifted his weight and plunged headfirst, cutting through the air faster than before. He gained on her. Luckily, she had assumed a skydiving posture, slowing her rate of descent.

Maddox grinned harshly, reveling in the challenge. He could reach her, he—

He spied a plume from the ground. A rocket, roaring upward. Flames lengthened behind it. The rocket climbed with great velocity, aiming at Shu. Someone on the ground had targeted her. Maddox would like to know why.

He tilted his feet so his toes pointed at the hidden stars. He had already begun to slow his descent so he wouldn’t crash against her too hard. Now, he realized he had to get to Shu before the missile did."
B01IP11LTY1,B01IP11LTY,"That Keith—if it had been him—had almost pulled it off showed once again the young man’s extreme piloting skills.

Maddox felt himself rise as he headed toward a circular belly hatch in a large airship. A few seconds ago, as he’d dropped toward the jumpfighter, he’d become aware of a shadow. Then, autocannon shells had hammered the tin can. That’s when the gravity beam had caught him. Maddox was familiar with such a ray, as one had caught him on the Builder Dyson sphere over a year ago. Did that mean the airship, or the people who ran it, had access to Builder technology? That seemed likely. Did they control the androids? Maddox gave that a high percentage as well.

He slid up through the circular hatch and gently landed on his feet inside a large chamber. The opening he’d come up through slid shut.

Two short and slender men stepped forward. They wore blue uniforms that fit tight around the throat, dark goggles over their eyes, and they aimed stubby projacs at him. They were Spacers. The circular pectoral patches meant these two were provost sentries, Marines in Star Watch terms. They looked vaguely familiar. Yes, he’d fought these two sentries before in Shanghai."
B07226D6320,B07226D632,"Rain rarely came to the desert and this wasn’t the season. From now through the holidays there wouldn’t even be a cloud in the sky. Come spring, the weather got a little iffy, but not often and not for long.

Happily Inc sat in the middle of the California desert, with Arizona to the east and Mexico to the south. An underground aquifer provided more than enough water for residents and visitors alike. There were mountains for those who preferred that topography, as well as an odd convergence of energy that made Happily Inc a special and magical place for those who believed in that kind of thing. More significant to daily life was the fact that the town was a destination wedding location with most of the local businesses focused on all things nuptial and tourist. The only large-scale exceptions were the sleep center north of town and Carol’s animal preserve to the southwest.

An unfamiliar car pulled into the parking lot and took Ronan’s spot. It was a nondescript sedan, a rental. His mother was behind the wheel and his father was nowhere to be seen. Unless Ceallach was hiding in the back seat, maybe this visit wasn’t going to be so bad after all."
B07226D6321,B07226D632,"The latter were done in various colors to reflect the seasons. White, blue and silver for winter, pale green, pink and peach for spring, red, orange and purple for summer and amber, moss green, chestnut and yellow for fall.

There had been a time when he, too, had created art, but he’d figured out this was his path. He liked what he did— he brought beauty to people’s everyday lives. If every now and then he yearned for something more, well, what was the point? Yes, he had some of their father’s talent, but Ronan and Nick were the artists. He was just a guy who worked with glass.

He studied the bowls, pleased with the outcome. Every year he tried to do something to challenge himself. For this year, he’d decided to add a shape to the serving pieces. The fall bowls had the outline of a leaf. Summer had been a strawberry and spring, a daisy. For winter, he would take on a snowflake—something he still had no idea how he was going to create. Every attempt had been a disaster, but that was half the fun.

His phone chirped. He glanced at the screen and saw he had a text from his mother."
B000FC1MCS0,B000FC1MCS,"And then there will be nothing to stop us from seeing all the stars in the world because they will all be moving toward us, gradually faster and faster, and we will know that the world is going to end soon because when we look up into the sky at night there will be no darkness, just the blazing light of billions and billions of stars, all falling.

Except that no one will see this because there will be no people left on the earth to see it. They will probably have become extinct by then. And even if there are people still in existence, they will not see it because the light will be so bright and hot that everyone will be burned to death, even if they live in tunnels.

19. Chapters in books are usually given the cardinal numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and so on. But I have decided to give my chapters prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and so on because I like prime numbers.

This is how you work out what prime numbers are.

First you write down all the positive whole numbers in the world.

B000FC1MCS1,B000FC1MCS,"And then I thought about how for a long time scientists were puzzled by the fact that the sky is dark at night, even though there are billions of stars in the universe and there must be stars in every direction you look, so that the sky should be full of starlight because there is very little in the way to stop the light from reaching earth.

Then they worked out that the universe was expanding, that the stars were all rushing away from one another after the Big Bang, and the further the stars were away from us the faster they were moving, some of them nearly as fast as the speed of light, which was why their light never reached us.

I like this fact. It is something you can work out in your own mind just by looking at the sky above your head at night and thinking without having to ask anyone.

And when the universe has finished exploding, all the stars will slow down, like a ball that has been thrown into the air, and they will come to a halt and they will all begin to fall toward the center of the universe again."
B078JWP5J80,B078JWP5J8,"He didn’t want to seem over-eager.

Piper Quinn, what a dream, he thought as he chewed. She might turn out to be nothing more than a pipe dream, but for now, he was happily inhaling that haze. In fact, if she was a fraction as amazing as she seemed at this moment, he’d be crazy to jeopardize things with her by impulse-marrying some other randomly dialed woman from his phone contacts list. He wanted this girl.

After more coins in the slot, since the pistachios hadn’t cut the hunger, Zach watched the processed snack cake spiral forward on its metal spring and drop. He tore it open. The compressed oats and honey crunched in his skull as he ate them, but they weren’t loud enough to drown out the echoes of how her voice sounded when she spoke.

What was that accent? He couldn’t wait to hear it again. How much longer? Eighteen minutes had passed. He could call her after twenty, right, not wait forty-five?

Down one floor, after wiping a stray oat from his tie, he tugged at the heavy wooden door of Crockett, Bowie & Houston, when a pair of female voices coming from the reception desk arrested his steps."
B078JWP5J81,B078JWP5J8,"Grudgingly peeling his eyes from her departing form, he pressed the eleventh floor button, which was where the associates’ break room held all his old friends the vending machines. Once again, he was up for a nutritious lunch of granola bars and bagged peanuts, which he’d likely be eating for dinner as well, based on the billable hours necessary for the Karlovy case.

Unless Piper Quinn said yes to dinner tonight.

He pulled out his phone to call her.

Oh, but she’d been just walking into the law office, possibly for some kind of meeting. Oh, please say she was applying for work at CBH. Throw that grenade into his path every single day, and it would be the best IED he could imagine.

Shoving his quarters into the slot, he realized this little challenge from Eisenhower had suddenly taken a serious turn. He wasn’t just scraping up someone, whoever, to fill a role. He could potentially snag a wife for career advancement and have a wife, for real, too. Speed and caution were on his must-do list if this was going to work.

A cellophane bag of pistachios dropped with a metallic thunk, and Zach dropped his phone in his pocket. Give it forty-five minutes, and then he’d call her."
B004CFAWK20,B004CFAWK2,"On the sink, already laid out, was a razor and a dish of shaving soap with a brush.

As he looked at himself in the mirror, he felt ashamed that they had seen him so dirty, but he had not had more than a speaking acquaintance with soap for quite a while now. He took the big bar of brown Oxydol soap and tried to scrub all the grime and coal dust off his face and hands. He had not had a drink in twenty-four hours, and his hands shook so bad he was not able to get a clean shave, but he did the best he could. After he had splashed himself with the Old Spice shaving lotion and combed his hair with the Ace comb he had found on the shelf above the sink, he came back out into the cafe.

Idgie and Ruth had set a place for him at a table. He sat down to a plate of fried chicken, black-eyed peas, turnip greens, fried green tomatoes, cornbread, and iced tea.

He picked up his fork and tried to eat. His hands were still shaking and he was not able to get the food to his mouth. He spilled his tea all over his shirt."
B004CFAWK21,B004CFAWK2,"He often wondered how Bernice was doing and thought he’d look her up one of these days, if he ever got back on his feet.

When he was about twenty or so, he lost the picture when some railroad bull detective kicked him off a freight into a cold, yellow river somewhere in Georgia, and now he hardly ever thought about her; except when he happened to be on a train, passing through the Smoky Mountains at night, on his way to somewhere else…

This morning, Smokey Phillips was on a mixed train from Georgia, headed for Florida. He had not eaten anything for two days and remembered that his friend Elmo Williams had told him that there were two women running a place right outside of Birmingham who were always good for a meal or two. On the way down he’d seen the name of the cafe written on the walls of several boxcars, so when he saw the sign WHISTLE STOP, ALABAMA, he jumped off.

He found the place across the tracks, just like Elmo had said. It was a small green building with a green-and-white awning under a Coca-Cola sign that said THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE. He went around the back and knocked on the screen door. A little black woman was busy frying chicken and slicing green tomatoes."
B01N21I4YH0,B01N21I4YH,"Before the accident, she had an allowance and a part-time job at a fast-food outlet but was using her earnings to save up for a new computer. Kyle had good grounds to tease her about her blog, but Tara didn’t care. She’d grown an immense network of friends through it. On the internet, no one cared how she spoke, what clique she fit into, or whether her jeans ended two inches above her ankles. She was proud to be a part of the misfits.

Tara finished her unpacking quickly then shoved the suitcase under her bed. She flopped back on the quilt and stared at the wooden ceiling. Peter had said the room had once been her mother ’s. How many times must she have looked at the same patterns in the boards? Then the idea occurred that the ceiling might be hers for the next three years, until she was old enough to move out. Her throat tightened. She rolled off the bed, returned to the hallway, then turned to the stairs. Company—even awkward company —was better than being alone.

Games

May and Peter were speaking in hushed tones as they washed the dishes but startled as Tara entered, giving her the impression they’d been talking about her.

Shifting on her feet, Tara rubbed at her forearm."
B01N21I4YH1,B01N21I4YH,"The house would easily accommodate ten people; compared to their old apartment, the Folcrofts’ home was a mansion. But the air felt still, and although noises echoed from the kitchen below, the upper level seemed too quiet. Tara moved to her room with quick steps and released a held breath as she crossed the threshold. She closed the door and turned back to the space that was supposed to be hers.

The suitcase lay on its side. Tara frowned, put her new camera on the dressing table, and picked up the suitcase. She’d seen Peter place it on its end, she was sure.

She set it upright again, tilted her head, and waited to see if it fell. It didn’t. She nudged it with her foot—first in one direction then the other. It didn’t even rock.

Weird. She looked towards the closed door. Was someone up here while I was talking to Kyle? I didn’t hear anyone, but then, I wasn’t listening…

A shudder ran up her back. She snatched the suitcase off the ground, laid it on the bed, and opened it to unpack. Her wardrobe was a little more varied than her brother’s, but still basic and embarrassingly outdated."
B00E45A2M80,B00E45A2M8,"Engaging my brain for a moment, I remembered Hobbes talking about the foreign-looking jewellery left behind in the burglary and Roman’s parents having bought the house just after the war. Perhaps, I thought, they had been foreigners who’d arrived in Britain at the time and, perhaps, they’d done something bad, or had acquired something they shouldn’t have, when Europe was in turmoil. And what if someone had tracked the hiding place down after all these years? I tried my theory out on Hobbes, who sniffed and stuck his head under a sideboard.

Crawling backwards, he squatted on his haunches, staring up at the panelled wall and down at the turquoise patterned carpet, scratching his chin with a sound like someone sawing wood. At first, I couldn’t see what had interested him. Then I became aware of faint scuffs on the carpet, suggesting the sideboard had been pulled away from the wall on one side and then pushed back. As I turned my head, the light striking the wall revealed a thin vertical crack along one side of the panelling. My heart lurched with excitement.

Hobbes stood up, hauling the sideboard out the way, poking the panelling with his thumbnail until a section swung back with a ping, revealing a wall safe. It wasn’t locked but it was empty. He glanced at me over his shoulder, raising his shaggy eyebrows."
B00E45A2M81,B00E45A2M8,"Right, Andy, I want to take a proper look at Roman’s house. Let’s see what we can find.’ He hustled me from the canteen to the car.

Feeling fully awake and fit by then, I was really able to appreciate the journey, which only went to show the advantage of having felt like death earlier. Hobbes, I decided, knew only one way to drive: with the accelerator pressed flat against the mat. For him, speed limits were restrictions applying, and only applying, to other road users. It was the same with one-way signs and he regarded red lights as optional. As we hurtled past the speed camera on Fenderton Road, he waved his warrant card in the instant it flashed. Gripping my seat, wide-eyed, speechless, I sat, anticipating a violent end at any second. As we passed the cemetery, I tried to take my mind off the fear by imagining which plot I’d fill, assuming they didn’t cremate me. Would, in fact, enough of me survive the inevitable smash to make a funeral worthwhile? My strategy was not working so well as I’d hoped and, once again, I was considering flinging myself into the road when Hobbes, with a crazed chuckle, spun the wheel to the right."
B00XFPKA020,B00XFPKA02,"I still find myself envying her, but now I have a shut off valve if those feelings ever try to take over. It took Renée and Laurent two more years to finally hook up, but all signs point to them being the love of each other’s lives.

As I pull up to my sister’s palatial home in the affluent town of Hilldale, I’m once again awed by the gentrified manor in which she lives. I think of my little yellow house on Mercer Avenue and realize what a far cry it is from the Bouviers’ estate. Renée and Laurent decided to move home when they discovered they were pregnant with Finn, as they wanted their kids to grow up close to family. Yet the two of them had amassed such a fortune in their respective businesses they needed a tax shelter for a sizeable chunk of it. That’s how they came to purchase a house so far beyond their needs. Even after turning half of the manse into Renée’s design studio, they still had room to spare.

I park my Honda next to what seems like dozens of fancy cars in the drive, check my make-up, and grab my gift."
B00XFPKA021,B00XFPKA02,"So she left him to consider his options, marry her and retire or lose her and continue racing, while she went back to Paris to shoot a new lipstick campaign.

Her phone rang on her first night at the George Cinq. It was Lorenzo’s manager, Jeffrey Hicks, calling to tell her Lorenzo had just been in a serious accident and he hadn’t made it. Renée was not able to digest the information. Cover Girl offered to postpone the shoot, but she declined. On set the next morning, Laurent gave her a big hug and offered his sympathy, secretly feeling guilty that perhaps his newfound lust for Renée was somehow responsible for killing her boyfriend. But Renée just thanked him and proceeded to pose her way to her most popular campaign ever.

Two days later, remarkably dry-eyed, she flew to Florence for Lorenzo’s funeral. She greeted his parents and helped to hostess the whole event, murmuring comforting words to the other mourners. When Renée left, she flew home to Pipsy and moved back in with Mom and Dad. She didn’t stop crying for four months. As much as I envy my sister, this one event brought her world crashing so low I decided then and there that she deserved any happiness that life brought her."
B009SQOO0Y0,B009SQOO0Y,"He began to circle the hidden Deceiver in the direction opposite that taken by One-Eye.

They were right. I get too serious under stress. I was a thousand years old already. Surviving Dejagore had not been easy. But all the rest of these guys had come through that, too. They had seen Mogaba’s slaughters of innocents. They had suffered the pestilences and plagues. They had seen the cannibalism and human sacrifices, the treacheries and betrayals and all the rest. And they had come away without letting the nightmares rule them.

I have to get a handle on it. I have to get some emotional distance and perspective. But there is something going on inside me that is beyond my control or understanding. Sometimes I feel like there are several of me in there, all mixed up, sometimes sitting behind the real me watching, watching. There may be no chance for me to recover complete sanity and stability.

Goblin came strutting back. He and One-Eye accompanied a man who was not much more than skin and bones. Few Deceivers are in good shape these days. They have no friends anywhere. They are hunted like vermin. Huge bounties ride on their shoulders.

Goblin flashed his toadlike grin."
B009SQOO0Y1,B009SQOO0Y,"I shied at shadows and remained crazy suspicious of everybody outside the Company, for no reason I could understand. But Croaker insisted, so here I was sneaking around in a dark and evil forest with icicles hanging off my butt, directing the first purely Company op in years. Only it wasn’t so purely Company when you considered the fact that all my guys had bodyguards with them.

I got over the self-confidence hurdle just by getting myself moving. Hell, it was too late to stop anything.

I stopped worrying about me and went to work worrying about how we would look after the raid was over. If we blew it we could not blame that on Taglian treachery or factionalism or incompetence, the usual sand in the machine.

I reached the crest of a low ridge. My hands were frozen but my body was wet inside my clothing. Light wavered ahead. The Deceivers, those lucky bastards, had a bonfire to keep them warm. I paused to listen. I heard nothing.

How did the Old Man know the leaders of the Strangler bands would gather for this particular festival? It was downright spooky the way he knew stuff sometimes. Maybe Lady was rubbing off. Maybe he had some magical talent he never mentioned."
B005PMWKZQ0,B005PMWKZQ,"Behind them, he could now make out a massive wall of steel and concertina wire some thirty feet high. Every fifty yards along the perimeter, a watchtower stood atop the wall, a slowly revolving searchlight mounted on each rooftop.

Two guards were visible behind the windows at each tower, both armed with automatic weapons. This new enclosure surely encircled much of the vast acreage of the old palace grounds. What had once been a dreamlike vision fit for a tsar, this majestic architectural masterpiece, given to the Korsakov family by Peter the Great, now had a new sinister aspect that was quite unsettling.

Six gate sentries appeared out of the mist, marching in loose formation, all with automatic weapons leveled at him. He pulled off his snow-encrusted sable hat and raised his arms into the air. He was smiling as a heavyset Russian Army officer, a captain, approached him, pulling his massive sidearm from the leather holster inside his full-length fur coat. Holding the gun loosely at his side, the man began shouting in Russian as he neared. Over the years Hawke had picked up enough native lingo to know the man was threatening to shoot him on the spot."
B005PMWKZQ1,B005PMWKZQ,"The compound was maybe a mile distant and since he’d gotten this far without being shot at, he was slowly gaining confidence that getting off Petra and approaching alone and on foot had been a good strategy.

His leg muscles afire, he marched on, planting one boot in front of the other for what seemed a hellish eternity. Another mile took him an hour to complete and brought him to the river. The river made no sound; it was running too fast and smooth. He sat down on a log to smoke a cigarette. Maybe it would stave off his hunger.

Rested, he flicked the cigarette away and got to his feet to ford the river. The swiftly flowing water was knee-deep and frigid, but not too wide. Climbing the bank on the far side, he saw that the principal road leading into the KGB compound had been recently plowed. There were tank-tread tracks in both directions, the new Russian T-95 judging by the depth and width of the tread dimensions. He gratefully walked the last few hundred yards or so with ease, steadily marching toward the waiting and watchful sentries near the main gate, wondering if he’d hear a shot ring out.

Russian Army soldiers standing in small groups were smoking and eyeing the intruder."
B002OFVO1I0,B002OFVO1I,"And so he didn’t understand how mothers felt in the course of this never-ending fear. After each letter from the front you felt better for a day or two, then you counted back how many days had passed since it was sent, and then your fear began again.

She has let the stocking fall from her grip, and has been sitting in a dream. Now she stands up quite mechanically, moves the soup from the stronger hotplate to the weaker one, and puts the potatoes on the better one. While she is doing that, the bell rings. She stands there, frozen. Enno! she thinks, Enno!

She puts the saucepan down and creeps silently in her felt slippers to the door. Her heart calms down: at the door, a little to the side so that she can be seen more easily, stands her neighbor, Frau Gesch. Surely she’s come to borrow something again, a little fat or flour, that she always forgets to return later. But Eva Kluge nevertheless remains suspicious. She tries to scan the landing as far as the peephole will allow, and she listens for every sound. But everything is as it should be: there is only Frau Gesch occasionally scraping her feet in impatience or looking into the peephole."
B002OFVO1I1,B002OFVO1I,"maybe she would remind him of something from his childhood, like the time he stole two marks from her and spent them on sweets, or, better yet, when he was thirteen and went out with that little floozie, Walli. The trouble there had been then, to get him out of her clutches— he was capable of such rages, her Karlemann!

But she smiled as she thought of it. Everything to do with the boys’ childhood seemed lovely to her. Back then, she still had the strength, she would have defended her boys against the whole world, she worked day and night so that they didn’t have to go without what other children got from their fathers. But over the past few years, she had gotten steadily weaker, particularly since the two of them had gone off to the war.

Well, the war should never have come about; if the Führer really was all he was cracked up to be, then it should have been avoided. Danzig and that little corridor outside it made a reason to put millions of people in daily fear of their lives—that really wasn’t so very statesmanlike!

But then they claimed he was illegitimate or all but. That he’d never had a mother to look after him properly."
B07BH3P4G20,B07BH3P4G2,"Thomas knew he should join the men at the wagons, but realized his sword was still in the form on the ground beside him. He turned back and reached down to retrieve it, but as soon as he placed his hand on the pommel, the Bedouin’s body bucked and a high-pitched moan escaped his lips. Thomas flinched and withdrew his hand. He looked at the man’s face. His covering had fallen away and Thomas stared into the clean-shaven face of a boy younger than himself. Surely no older than thirteen.

A boy. Mary, Mother of God.

Thomas looked again to his sword embedded up to the hilt in the boy’s stomach.

I must remove it. The boy will die…

As soon as he touched the handle, the boy cried out and squirmed in pain. He grabbed onto Thomas’s hand with a strength that belied both his size and age. He said something Thomas did not understand and shook his head. His eyes were wide and they would not let Thomas look away.

Thomas was dimly aware of voices behind him, and although he could hear the words, he could not comprehend their meaning, nor tear his eyes from the boy’s own."
B07BH3P4G21,B07BH3P4G2,"His horse screamed and Thomas knew he had to throw himself from his saddle or risk being crushed to death by the stallion, but there simply was not time. He saw the hard road, felt it tear at the skin under his leggings, saw his horse’s legs above him blocking out the sky, then the road again. He felt a crushing weight over one leg, a suffocating presence on his chest, the sky presented itself once again, then he was on one knee with nothing but blackness in front of him.

His sword arm was straight out in front, and it dawned on him then that his gloved hand still clutched his blade. The blackness took shape. Thomas looked up, his vision unhindered by the loss of his helmet, and a set of brown eyes wide with agony, stared back. The Bedouin fell first to his knees, then to his side, dragging Thomas’s blade out of his hand.

Remembering his earlier battle with the Terror Fury, Thomas told himself he must keep moving. He pivoted on his knee and looked in the direction of voices coming from behind him. Alain and Roderick were running toward him on foot. Behind them, near the wagons, the other sergeants were sitting calmly atop their destriers while a few fleeing riders made their escape through the woods."
B00KX9WHTA0,B00KX9WHTA,"Sheets and blanket gift packages were used as currency by the women in The Lane. A popular wedding present, sheets and blankets were beautifully packaged with satin ribbons. The women knew better than to open the package. The pawn shops paid good money on a set of sheets or blankets. In really hard times women borrowed the packaged sheets and blankets from one another. The money you could get from the pawn shop for several sets of sheets, with careful planning, would keep a family fed for a couple of weeks. It wasn’t unheard of for the women to bunch together their sheet packages to help a neighbour out with the rent. To the people of The Lane good sheets and blankets were currency. They were not to be used as bed covers.

The noise coming from the back yard dragged Ivy out of her wool-gathering daze. She’d been reliving Jem’s words, trying to find a way of dealing with a situation that scared her so much it rattled her bones. She hadn’t bothered to check the time yet this morning. It didn’t seem that important. She sighed deeply as the music of many women chatting carried into her room. It must be a lot later than she’d thought."
B00KX9WHTA1,B00KX9WHTA,"She hurried out of the freezing cold room, slamming the dividing door at her back, wanting to keep the heat in the back room.

She quickly filled her cup and, still standing by the range enjoying the heat, she took the first sip of the tea that was her lifeblood. With a contented smile she stood and emptied the china cup in minutes. She refilled the cup before walking over to the kitchen table.

Taking a knife from the drawer under the lip of her kitchen table she shaved the large block of kitchen soap into the steaming water and swirled it around with her hand. With a grin she made bubbles in the space between her thumb and fist, blowing the bubbles away and admiring the rainbow of colour that danced around the room. Her da would have given her a thick ear for messing but he wasn’t here and she did love to make bubbles. She dunked an old rag into the warm soapy water and prepared to scrub herself clean.

By the time she’d washed and dressed Ivy had emptied the teapot. With her warm clothes in place, her long knitted stockings pulled up her legs and her boys’ work boots on her feet, she was ready to face whatever came her way."
B01MQ1NCRS0,B01MQ1NCRS,"I turned to open the door and stopped dead… through the strip of glass in the door, standing by the goody bag table was… Jamie Dawson.

He was dressed in a sharp black suit, opened-necked shirt, a loose fitting tie and trainers. I ducked to one side and flicked off the light in the storeroom. What the hell? I thought. I hadn’t eaten much all day, but would it make me hallucinate Jamie Dawson? Did he even live in London? The last I’d heard was that he was working in Canada.

I peered back through the glass in the door. Yes, it was Jamie Dawson, chatting away to the goody bag girls. He laughed and his wide smile was bookended by dimples. A lock of chestnut hair fell across his face. I noticed next to him stood a beautiful dark-haired girl with ghostly pale skin. Her dress was pink lace, so tight, it looked as if it had been painted onto her hourglass figure. Her skin was like flawless porcelain. I recognised her from somewhere… She reached up tucking the stray hair behind Jamie’s ear. My heart began to race; fear flooded through me and I ducked back out of sight, pressing my head against the cool wood of the door."
B01MQ1NCRS1,B01MQ1NCRS,"It’s what we’ve been working towards Nat, for so long … Look, we’ve even got press here from America.’ She pointed to a blonde lady in an immaculate trouser suit as she did a piece to camera with her microphone.

We went back inside and I went up to one of the spare dressing rooms to get ready. The green dress from Sharon was beautiful, simple and elegant with a bit of cleavage on show for good measure. I gave my hair a touch up with the straighteners, and vamped up my make-up a little. It was one of those occasions when everything went right. My eyes were dramatic and smoky; my hair was sleek and straight with just enough volume. Why could I never pull this off on a date? The last couple of times I had been out with Benjamin, I’d been bloated and had an attack of the frizz.

I pulled out my mobile and called Benjamin, but after a couple of rings his phone went to voicemail. I stared at the screen. He’d cancelled my call… Maybe he was just about to meditate, I thought. A knock roused me out of my thoughts and Nicky entered."
B07BCPY2X60,B07BCPY2X6,"She was sitting about four feet away from a small metal pail that held our little fire. Charlie sighed and adjusted the blanket that she had draped over her shoulders before hugging herself.

Logan dropped another small piece of wood into the fire, and it crackled as it blazed up, rising out of the pail. A trail of smoke danced up toward the ceiling and out through the large cracks. Logan glanced at Charlie, but lowered his head and stepped back.

Charlie hadn’t been the same since she’d almost been taken away from us. Most of the time, Ryder carried her club because she just didn’t have the energy. She was constantly distracted. Charlie never went off on her own unless it was because she needed to use the restroom. Not that most places even had bathrooms.

Every inch of the church was cold, except the area within a three-foot radius of the metal pail. It was a good thing we still had our jackets and blankets to help keep us warm.

I was lying on a broken, slanted pew staring at the stained-glass windows that had managed to stay mostly intact. My stomach grumbled so loud I was sure the others had heard it."

We’d been traveling for weeks without any problems. For the most part, things had been going quite smoothly. We’d made significant progress, but we had all been functioning in some crazy state far beyond exhaustion.

The only time we stopped walking was to eat, sleep, or refill our water bottles otherwise it was full steam ahead. I had no idea where we were, or how far from home I was, but none of that really mattered. The only thing that did matter was getting as far south as I possibly could so that I could finally find my new home. To start rebuilding what I’d lost. And the only thing I was certain about was that I wasn’t there yet.

When it had started snowing again a few days ago, we’d stopped and holed up in an abandoned church. The insides were caked in dust and dirt, but there weren’t tracks in the dust. It was empty and had been for a while. There was mold and mildew everywhere, but it was better than being outside."
B000FBJARS0,B000FBJARS,"He aped Stubbs’s annoyance at the thought of a possibly humdrum French posting, but in fact, this was welcome news.

He was no more immune to the lure of adventure than any other soldier, and would enjoy to see the exotic sights of India. However, he was also well aware that such a foreign posting would likely keep him away from England for two years or more—away from Helwater.

A posting in Calais or Rouen, though … he could return every few months without much difficulty, fulfilling the promise he had made to his Jacobite prisoner—a man who doubtless would be pleased never to see him again.

He shoved that thought resolutely aside. They had not parted on good terms—well, on any. But he had hopes in the power of time to heal the breach. At least Jamie Fraser was safe; decently fed and sheltered, and in a position where he had what freedom his parole allowed. Grey took comfort in the imagined vision—a long-legged man striding over the high fells of the Lake District, face turned up toward sun and scudding cloud, wind blowing through the richness of his auburn hair, plastering shirt and breeches tight against a lean, hard body."
B000FBJARS1,B000FBJARS,"… perhaps one of the German states, Prague on the Russian front, or even the West Indies. Great Britain was battling France for supremacy on three continents, and life was good for a soldier.

They passed an amiable quarter hour in such idle conjectures, during which Grey’s mind was free to return to the difficulties posed by his inconvenient discovery. In the normal course of things, Trevelyan would be Hal’s problem to deal with. But his elder brother was abroad at the moment, in France and unreachable, which left Grey as the man on the spot. The marriage between Trevelyan and Olivia Pearsall was set to take place in six weeks’ time; something would have to be done, and done quickly.

Perhaps he had better consult Paul or Edgar—but neither of his half-brothers moved in society; Paul rusticated on his estate in Sussex, barely moving a foot as far as the nearest market town. As for Edgar … no, Edgar would not be helpful. His notion of dealing discreetly with the matter would be to horsewhip Trevelyan on the steps of Westminster.

The appearance of a steward at the door, announcing the arrival of Colonel Quarry, put a temporary end to his distractions.

Rising, he touched Stubbs’s shoulder."
B00VVN3TGM0,B00VVN3TGM,"My plan was to poke my nose around at the spa in order to figure out whether there was evidence of a prostitution ring here. Then, I’d work my way backwards and straight up to the top. A rumor from a family friend, who knew someone, who knew someone, who knew someone’s brother that enjoyed friendly massages, had led me here in the first place. With a little bit of cash and the promise of a bigger reward, this friend mentioned that I might have luck starting at this particular spa.

However, each time I tried to eke out a question, a bucket of water was dumped into my mouth. But when the sandpaper came out, I realized that getting water dumped in my face was a pleasant experience – sort of like a light tickle – compared to the vicious scrubbing that followed.

One moment I was lying on the table almost relaxed, the next it felt like the woman was trying to skin me alive. Which, I guess she was. She put a mitten over her hand – I’d seen it when I peeked during a rare moment when water wasn’t in my eyes – and started scrubbing my calves with the fierceness I expected from someone scrubbing a particularly grimy pan that’d been sitting unwashed in the sink for days."
B00VVN3TGM1,B00VVN3TGM,"Meg spread her arms wide as we reached the end of the staircase. There were two doors on either side of the hallway, one for the ladies locker room and one for the dude room. The women’s section wasn’t quite as separated from the men ’s as I would have liked , so I scooted in past the entrance as quick as humanly possible and glanced around, taking stock of my surroundings.

The locker room was shaped like an L, from what I could see. I was on the short end of two intersecting hallways, standing near rows of white, shiny sinks, fluffy stacks of towels, and lots and lots of skin. The long hallway was punctuated with small offshoots of lockers and dressing areas.

I took a big gulp, preparing myself to go spelunking into the deepest depths of the scary place called the Women’s Locker Room. I dashed through benches, sinks and showers, finally leaping around the corner into the security of the maroon cubbies where women left their belongings. When I paused in my scooting long enough to look up, there was an array of women – all shapes and sizes and colors – walking around naked."
B071HXVJQF0,B071HXVJQF,"With her are six people: a foreign consultant whose face I’ve been seeing a lot in DOCIR internal meetings, a DOCIR director who oversees avian flu, and four others I’ve never met.

It’s when I realize that the four others are the heads, respectively, of the Directorate General of Animal Contagious Diseases, the Directorate General of Outbreak Management, the Directorate General of Zoonotic Diseases, and the Directorate General of National Surveillance that I know this is not just some routine meeting. It’s a full-blown emergency.

Two and a half hours after the meeting wraps up, Irma and I are sitting at a restaurant at the corner of Jalan Salemba Raya. I’m not quite sure why we’ve ended up here, rather than, say, one of the local Arab joints, which are still pretty decent even if they don’t hold a candle to the glorious gems in Little Arabia in the Condet Pejaten area, the ones that do goat and biryanis because they were born for it. Or why not the Padang food stall in front of the Salemba prison that is always packed to the gills? When Irma walks ahead of me into the restaurant, I notice her usually flat stomach is looking a tad paunchier than usual. Terrible. Not the paunch, but my noticing it and feeling a little smug, as though we’re in the same league to begin with."
B071HXVJQF1,B071HXVJQF,"Also in attendance are two officials from another ministry— the Ministry of Agriculture —and a bunch of people I don’t know: academic types, from their distracted gazes, and assorted individuals from the private sector.

There’s a lull, and I find myself glad that Leon isn’t here. He’s a consultant, too, but for the Global Health Institute. Two months ago, he ratted me out to my boss at OneWorld when he caught me stuffing my face with chicken wings during an out-of-town work assignment when everyone else was dealing with dead chicken of a different kind. Granted, I was guilty as charged, but that doesn’t mean he’s not a jerk. He is a jerk who thinks he’s God’s gift to women. So, okay, he is very good-looking. But I’m glad he’s not here for another reason. I don’t think I could handle the sight of him drooling all over Katrin like a stupid teenage boy.

It’s 9:42. More cream puffs and some lemper—little rice dumplings stuffed with chicken—are offered to me. This time by Tam. He’s a lecturer in veterinary medicine at the Agriculture Institute in Bandung and, like me, a consultant for the Ministry—someone I actually don’t particularly dislike (though that’s not saying much)."
B071NRP12Z0,B071NRP12Z,"Tumbling, rolling out of control, he splashed down half stunned. He surfaced and looked for any sign of his parents—only to see the tentacles pull them down into its swirling chaos. His mother’s body drooped backward with a grotesque kink in her spine, but his father resisted his fate with a storm of vulgarity and a wand throwing fire.

Sprays of color streaked over Cade’s head and struck the beast. He twisted around as he treaded water, then marveled at the sight of three strangers joining the battle. A gray-bearded man hovered in midair, his long coat fluttering as he hurled orbs of fire at the sea creature. A young man in a suit sprinted over the waves while conjuring shimmering arrows. A third man, too far away for Cade to see clearly, stood on the pitched deck of the Athenia; with balletic gestures he levitated unconscious survivors from the water and planted them in a bobbing lifeboat whose passengers were all unconscious.

A fearsome sizzling and a shriek turned Cade’s head toward the whirlpool. Lightning arced from his father’s wand and stabbed into the gyre that swallowed him, the monster, and Cade’s mother.

The vortex shrank from sight and the North Sea rushed in to take its place."
B071NRP12Z1,B071NRP12Z,"Tourist- and steerage-class denizens glared at Cade, his parents, and the other first-class passengers as they shouldered their way to the front of the line, hectored by curses. A young woman clutching an infant to her breast regarded Cade with terrified eyes as he and his parents ascended the steps to the lifeboats.

Ahead of them, the first lifeboat finished loading, a mass of nervous passengers between two young crewmen of the Athenia, one each at the boat’s bow and stern. As Cade and his parents watched its launch, Cade realized being among the first to abandon ship might be more a curse than a blessing. Tangled ropes and bad timing of the crane arm’s outward swing tilted the boat. Its posh complement yowled as they clung to seats and gunwales, desperate not to be pitched overboard. Their less wealthy fellow passengers still on the Athenia snickered at the toffs’ predicament.

The laughter ceased as the ropes went slack and the lifeboat plunged out of control. It righted itself just before it struck the water, but it landed hard, and its splash showered the crowd on the deck.

Above them, officers barked orders full of jargon at the launch crews."
B0713VYF5H0,B0713VYF5H,"Palmer had no sooner glided over to the next table in search of a dance partner than Ember felt a tap on her shoulder. She looked up to see Zeke Tremont, a ranch hand on the Silver Feather.

Zeke was salt of the earth—loyal, kindhearted, and hardworking. Unfortunately, the lanky cowboy had two strikes against him. While his butt looked fantastic in a pair of jeans, he was rather plain, with clay-colored hair and weathered skin. And at thirty-one, he’d already been married three times.

Poor Zeke had the old-fashioned notion that he should get married before having sex, and he had a tendency to fall hard and fast for the wrong sort of woman. Women had happily taken advantage of his sweet nature to get their hands on the million dollars he’d won in the Texas lottery when he was eighteen. The women, and the money, were long gone, but Zeke owned his own home, free and clear, and he was good with kids and animals. Not a bad catch for the right woman.

The matchmaker in her started thinking about the single women she knew who would overlook Zeke’s homeliness in favor of his winsome personality and gentle nature."
B0713VYF5H1,B0713VYF5H,"What more could she ask for?

Except Ranger had been in New Zealand for the past year, elbow deep in postdoctoral studies in astrobiology at the University of Canterbury, and she missed him terribly. It was almost as if she’d lost a limb.

They stayed in contact for sure, but lately he’d been finishing up his research, and his texts and phone calls had grown fewer and farther between. She hadn’t heard from him in almost a month. It was the longest they’d ever gone without being in contact.

Out on the dance floor, the music changed. Susan danced with her father under white twinkle lights strung from the rustic rafters.

The reception was being held at the Silver Feather Ranch, where Ember’s younger sister Kaia lived with Ranger’s older brother, Ridge, and their new baby daughter, Ingrid.

The Silver Feather had a chapel and reception barn they rented out for country-style weddings. Ember’s youngest sister, Aria, worked as a wedding planner. While her older brother, Archer, was the Silver Feather’s ranch foreman, following in their father’s footsteps. The Silver Feather was a family affair for both the Alzates and the Lockharts.

Honestly, it could get claustrophobic being around people who knew her so well."
B01922I2AQ0,B01922I2AQ,"When he asked her to go back to his home with him, she went along. The two of them traveled up the valley, beyond where she had ever been before, until they came to a creek that ran down out of the mountains. He took her to a den in the rocks. It was cold & damp & stunk of fish. For days on end he left her there with nothing but raw fish to eat. He warned her to never leave the den. She was lonely, so one day she tracked him through the snow. After a short time, his prints turned to otter tracks. She kept on them until she came to a bank den. That’s when she saw her husband in his true form—a river otter, being welcomed by his otter wife.

Tillman was disbelieving. I had heard similar stories among Indians, but not such a firsthand claim.

—They believe it is a thin line separates animal & man, Samuelson said.— They hold that some can walk back & forth over that line, here a man, there a beast.

Tillman sat forward. He reminded me of a small boy listening to a tall tale.

—So what happened?"
B01922I2AQ1,B01922I2AQ,"We heated only tins of beans in the flames for our meal so did not hesitate to accept her gift. We expressed our gratitude, but she did not seem to know our words.

—Doesn’t she have a man to hunt for her? Tillman asked.

He winked at her, but the girl gave no response.

Samuelson asked her a series of questions in her own tongue, which she answered in a near whisper. They spoke a long time. Never once did she bring up her eyes, as if she feared our gaze would turn her to stone. She then walked down the beach towards her own camp, but before she had gone a few steps, she spoke one last time to Samuelson. He nodded.

—Well? What did she say? Tillman asked.

—She had a husband once.

—Pretty young thing like that. Doubt any man would give that up. So, what happened to the fellow?

—She killed him, Samuelson said.— Slit his throat as he slept.

It was a surprising answer, but no more so than the rest of the story the trapper told us.

The woman said that two winters ago a stranger came down out of the Wolverine Valley. No one had seen him before, but he was a good hunter & quick on his feet."
B002HHPVPS0,B002HHPVPS,"They had continued to leave during the Balkan Wars. Lefty and Desdemona’s cousin, Sourmelina, had gone to America and was living now in a place called Detroit. Built along a gentle slope of the mountain, Bithynios wasn’t a precarious, cliffside sort of place. It was an elegant, or at least harmonious, cluster of yellow stucco houses with red roofs. The grandest houses, of which there were two, had çikma, enclosed bay windows that hung out over the street. The poorest houses, of which there were many, were essentially one-room kitchens. And then there were houses like Desdemona and Lefty’s, with an overstuffed parlor, two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a backyard privy with a European toilet. There were no shops in Bithynios, no post office or bank, only a church and one taverna. For shopping you had to go into Bursa, walking first and then taking the horse-drawn streetcar.

In 1922 there were barely a hundred people living in the village. Fewer than half of those were women. Of forty-seven women, twenty-one were old ladies. Another twenty were middle-aged wives. Three were young mothers, each with a daughter in diapers. One was his sister. That left two marriageable girls. Whom Desdemona now rushed to nominate."
B002HHPVPS1,B002HHPVPS,"It was still years before Desdemona, cutting cucumbers, would lean against the corner of the kitchen table and, without realizing it, would lean in a little harder, and after that would find herself taking up that position every day, the table corner snug between her legs. Now, preparing her brother’s meals, she sometimes struck up her old acquaintance with the dining table, but she wasn’t conscious of it. It was her body that did it, with the cunning and silence of bodies everywhere.

Her brother’s trips to the city were different. He knew what he was looking for, apparently; he was in full communication with his body. His mind and body had become one entity, thinking one thought, bent on one obsession, and for the first time ever Desdemona couldn’t read that thought. All she knew was that it had nothing to do with her.

It made her mad. Also, I suspect, a little jealous. Wasn’t she his best friend? Hadn’t they always told each other everything? Didn’t she do everything for him, cook, sew, and keep house as their mother used to? Wasn’t she the one who had been taking care of the silkworms single-handedly so that he, her smart little brother, could take lessons from the priest, learning ancient Greek?"
B00HZZT5ZO0,B00HZZT5ZO,"But the rest of the hiking club had decided to tackle a more strenuous hike that would take over seven hours. Emily might flat-out refuse to go, or she might insist on going because of her pride. Either way, it wouldn’t be a good first hike experience. Plus, the Gherrings were going. Steven Gherring was in amazing shape, since he was constantly training for Iron Man competitions. Emily’s mother seemed fairly fit as well, but she’d recently visited the emergency room for her ulcer. A seven-hour hike seemed like a bad idea for someone who’d been in the hospital earlier in the week.

He planned to suggest an alternate hike, but that meant it would only be the four of them. Emily seemed diametrically opposed to anything resembling a date. Would she think he was trying to trick her into going on a hike without a big group of friends? He’d considered asking one of his sisters to come along to make Emily feel more comfortable, but he didn’t want his sisters to meet Emily. They would pick up on his feelings for her and tease him mercilessly, and with good reason. He’d done the same to them numerous times.

He walked into the lobby of the apartment building to find Steven Gherring waiting alone."
B00HZZT5ZO1,B00HZZT5ZO,"She’d given him one of those full-on devastating smiles. He’d really had to work hard for this one. She must really, really hate shopping. She’d been acting awfully strange—jumping, dropping things, tossing shoes into the air. And she was really stubborn, even more stubborn than his four sisters. And that was saying a lot. He hated to be so demanding, but he knew he’d feel responsible if she got blisters on the hike. After all, he’d talked her into it when she obviously didn’t want to go.

He wasn’t quite sure how he’d accomplished it. He guessed he’d convinced her by emphasizing they’d be going as friends. That seemed to be her main concern. Just his luck... Girls had thrown themselves at him for years while he’d insisted on remaining friends. But since he’d met a girl special enough for his first kiss, she had instituted the friends policy. God must have a sense of humor.

He felt really protective of her, the way he felt about his sisters. No. Nothing like the way he felt about his sisters. He never thought about kissing his sisters, and he thought about kissing Emily all the time.

He turned his face toward her again."
B01NA94ZFH0,B01NA94ZFH,"The night air was so full of rain it was a struggle to even breathe, and my puny torch barely made a glimmer in the blackness. Hunched against the storm, clutching the dressing gown, I stumbled and groped my way through the communal garden until there was a lull in the wind. It gave me the opportunity to run, but, unfortunately, I ran into something that knocked the wind from my lungs, as it knocked me onto my back, where I lay stunned for a few moments with rain pouring up my nose. When my lungs re-inflated and my head cleared, I tried to stand up, but struck my head and fell back, moaning. By the feeble glow of my torch, I saw I’d again been flattened by the tree. My teeth were chattering and, although sense told me to concede defeat and to retreat into the dry, a tiny seed of resolve was growing. Getting back to my feet, I forced myself onward, battling the elements, imagining myself a hero such as Scott of the Antarctic, though memories of his tragic end were not encouraging. Onward I went, through branches and twigs, getting scratched and battered, until I reached a massive hole in the wall containing a huge chunk of tree. I scrambled into what had been the inside."
B01NA94ZFH1,B01NA94ZFH,"The outside had come inside, and vice versa, and our bed and all our things were downstairs on our new neighbours’ flattened flat. They’d only moved in a couple of weeks earlier, and I hadn’t even met them. I shouted down, but got no response, and feared I never would. The situation was clearly far worse than I’d imagined, but the gust of wet wind around my nether regions reminded me that I was in no state to parade around. Yet, since all my clothes, not to mention the wardrobe that had contained them, were now downstairs, I was nonplussed until I remembered Daphne’s dressing gown. She kept it on a hook behind the bedroom door, and, unless it had blown away, it might still be there. Groping around the back, terrified of the drop in front, I found it at last and jiggled it loose. Although it was sopping wet, small and pink, it was far better than nothing.

I put it on, tied the cord, and scrambled back over the branches to the hallway, where Mrs Rodgers, a large and normally cheerful divorcee of indeterminate age, and Mr Hussain, a slight, bald man in his late fifties, were talking in her doorway. Both were holding candles. Both gaped when they saw me."
B001OLRMXC0,B001OLRMXC,"He’d never dreamed in his wildest fancies that he’d be given a second chance at the house. After his mother had died, he’d traveled to the West Coast. Probably, he later realized, to get as far away as possible from Maine. He’d committed clumsy fraud in Los Angeles and San Francisco, deliberately alienating Spiritualists and scientists alike in order to be free of them. He’d existed barely for thirty years, washing dishes, doing farmwork, selling door to door, janitoring, anything to earn money without using his mind.

Yet, somehow, he’d protected his ability and nurtured it. It was still there, maybe not as spectacular as it had been when he was fifteen, but very much intact—and backed now by the thoughtful caution of a man rather than the suicidal arrogance of a teenager. He was ready to shake loose the dormant psychic muscles, exercise and strengthen them, use them once more. Against that pesthole up in Maine.

Against Hell House.

DECEMBER 21,1970

11:19 A.M.

The two black Cadillacs moved along the road, which twisted through dense forest. In the lead car was Deutsch’s representative. Dr. Barrett, Edith, Florence Tanner, and Fischer rode in the second, chauffeur-driven limousine, Fischer sitting on the pull-down seat, facing the other three.

Florence put her hand on Edith’s."
B001OLRMXC1,B001OLRMXC,"Fischer reached for the coffeepot and poured himself another cupful. He rubbed a hand across his eyes and picked up one of the magazines lying on the coffee table in front of him. It was one of Deutsch’s. What else? he thought.

After a while his eyes went out of focus, and the words on the page began to blur together. Going back, he thought. The only one of nine people still walking around, and he was going back for more.

They’d found him lying on the front porch of the house that morning in September 1940, naked, curled up like a fetus, shivering and staring into space. When they’d put him on a stretcher, he’d begun to scream and vomit blood, his muscles knotting, rocklike. He’d lain in a coma three months in the Caribou Falls Hospital. When he’d opened his eyes, he’d looked like a haggard man of thirty, a month short of his sixteenth birthday. Now he was forty-five, a lean, gray-haired man with dark eyes, his expression one of hard, suspicious readiness.

Fischer straightened in the chair. Never mind; it’s time, he thought. He wasn’t fifteen anymore, wasn’t naïve or gullible, wasn’t the credulous prey he’d been in 1940. Things would be different this time."
B00SA4ZUFS0,B00SA4ZUFS,"The bike would also need fuel later on, but he, Janvier, and a few others who used this method of transport had hidden caches in a number of discreet locations.

For now, he could just ride the mountain pathways and glory in the wind pressing against him. It threatened to push him right off his bike and into a massive gorge halfway through. Teeth bared at the challenge, he bent lower over the bars and kept going. At one point, after he’d slowed down to admire a sparkling river, he saw a sign that warned of tigers in the area.

It reminded him of Elena’s attempts to find out his origins.

Laughing so hard he almost fell off the bike, he gunned the engine and took off again. He didn’t stop when the hard, clear sunlight turned to shadows, then to midnight, his night vision as good as his ordinary sight. Utilizing a fuel cache when necessary, he continued on. He had to stop and hunt a few hours later, but even if he hadn’t found prey, he was in no danger of starving, old enough that his body didn’t burn through as much fuel as a younger vampire.

Not that he was a vampire exactly, but it was the word most people used to describe him."
B00SA4ZUFS1,B00SA4ZUFS,"Naasir had learned to ride motorcycles with Janvier after the machines first became fast and exciting. They’d both fallen off more than once. Never during that time or afterward, had Naasir worn a helmet. He picked one up today, though—the last time Ashwini had seen him riding without a helmet, she’d gotten so angry that he’d apologized then gone out with her and bought a helmet.

Janvier’s hunter mate had lost her brother and sister less than a year earlier; she’d been so sad for so long that it had hurt Naasir to see it. He wasn’t going to be responsible for making her sad again by getting so damaged even his immortality couldn’t save him—because unlike what the mortals believed, Naasir knew no one was totally immortal.

Then there was Lijuan.

The Archangel of China had a nasty habit of coming back from the dead.

Considering once again what might keep her dead, he put on the helmet then started up the bike. It came on with a silken roar. Gear stowed, he gave the mechanic a thumbs-up and headed out. He’d fed from bottled blood and cold meat on the jet, and it would fuel him for the next stage of the journey."
B017GFRJZK0,B017GFRJZK,"Flipping to the next picture, Erin held up red-and-white pom poms, her face coated with more makeup than I would have preferred with her being just fourteen years old. A cheerleader for a daughter. Hmm. Not sure what I did growing up, but picturing me, or what I knew of me, in a tight-fitting outfit, my sole purpose to cheer for the hunky, brainless football players … well, I just couldn’t see it. Then again, maybe Erin had followed in her mother’s footsteps.

I must have influenced them in some way, hopefully for the better. I found another picture of Luke in a basketball uniform, then thumbed through to the last picture. I paused, allowing my eyes to take it all in. It was me, with Luke and Erin on either side. We were all soaked from head to toe. It looked like we’d just gotten off one of those log flume rides. I had an arm draped over the shoulders of each kid, drawing them close. We looked silly, but connected. We wore smiles that were unique to a tightly knit family.

They both seemed so happy. I did too.

Where was Mark? Maybe he was the one taking the picture."
B017GFRJZK1,B017GFRJZK,"Come on, Alex. He’s your husband, and the father of your two kids, even if you can’t recall them. Cut him a break. He’s been dealing with a lot of shit since you wrapped your car around a tree.

I pressed my fingers into the corners of my eyes. My head ached from the inside out. I took in a slow breath, wondering if my first session with the speech therapist later in the morning would provide that magic moment when all my memories and thoughts and feelings would flood my body, like lifting the wall of a dam. I was ready for it, even if the Alex that Jerry and Nick had described wouldn’t be nominated for Miss Congeniality. That was work, I reminded myself. That had nothing to do with the kind of person I was, still was—my values, how I treated my friends, and most importantly, my family.

My kids.

My eyes gravitated back to the phone screen, and I studied the first picture. Luke had a huge grin, his thick, wavy hair parted in just left of center. His prominent nose was covered with freckles …and it was adorable.

Just then, I touched my own nose."
B002RI9KL80,B002RI9KL8,"hands.’

Upon which, he leapt into a boat and gave the boatman the order to row him out to the Pharaon where the shipowner, as you will recall, had arranged to meet him.

VI

The Deputy Crown Prosecutor

That same day, at the same time, in the Rue du Grand-Cours, opposite the Fontaine des Méduses, a betrothal feast was also being celebrated, in one of those old buildings in the aristocratic style of the architect Puget. However, instead of the participants in this other scene being common people, sailors and soldiers, they belonged to the cream of Marseillais society. There were former magistrates who had resigned their appointments under the usurper, veteran officers who had left our army to serve under Condé, and young men brought up by families which were still uncertain about their security, despite the four or five substitutes that had been hired for them, out of hatred for the man whom five years of exile were to make a martyr, and fifteen years of Restoration, a god.1

They were dining and the conversation flowed back and forth, fired by every passion – those passions of the time that were still more terrible, ardent and bitter in the South where, for five centuries, religious quarrels had seconded political ones."
B002RI9KL81,B002RI9KL8,"Dantès guessed what was in his father’s mind and replied with a smile full of filial love. Mercédès had started to watch the time on the cuckoo clock in the room, and she made a sign to Edmond.

Around the table reigned the noisy merriment and freedom of manners that, among people of the lower orders, are common accompaniments to the end of a meal. Those who were dissatisfied with their places had got up from the table and gone to find new neighbours. Everyone had started to speak at once, and no one was bothering to listen to what the person next to him was saying, but was concerned only with his own thoughts.

Fernand’s pallor was almost reflected on the cheeks of Danglars; as for Fernand himself, all life appeared to have left him and he was like one of the damned in a lake of fire. He had been among the first to get up and was striding backwards and forwards across the room, trying to block his ears to the sound of songs and clinking glasses.

Caderousse went over to him, just as Danglars, whom he had apparently been trying to avoid, caught up with him in a corner of the room."
B076DDY98M0,B076DDY98M,"Now it came to this, the trowel. He had no grave-box to use with Mare. He'd ignored her and that was a mistake. He dropped silently to a crouch, straining to get some sense of her ahead, but the feeling was imprecise, like a vague scent on the wind.

He pressed through a break in the thick leaves, and glimpsed the faint white stone of the wall. Beside it lay a large potato sack, bulging with whatever she'd taken. He took one more step, holding out the trowel before him, and something shot out of the shadows and struck him in the ribs.

Pain burst in his chest and he staggered backward through the foliage, into the solid bulk of a tall grave. The back of his head cracked on the stone and he crumpled down to his knees, as another blow swished down through the leaves toward him. He tried to twist away but it struck him on the upper arm, instantly deadening it. Pain lit up in his shoulder and he caught a glimpse of Mare's sagging face, demonic in a flash of moonlight, before another sharp blow struck the side of his head. He hit the ground on his chest and tasted dirt."
B076DDY98M1,B076DDY98M,"Sen hefted the trowel from his pack, and together they hurried into the shadow of the cathedral, running silently along the grass verge through the graveyard. When the Moleman pointed out Mare's route to the wall, Sen led them through the graves, picking out a path he'd run a hundred times before. At the edge he plunged into the deep dark of thick brunifer bushes.

The honey smell of resin filled the air. The bushes swayed and settled around him, branches pressing against his sides and face, flexing to make room. He stilled his breathing and strained all his senses. The grounds were silent but still he felt something; the cold clinical sense of the Moleman somewhere nearby, the bitter tang of Mare's thoughts ahead.

He peered through the dark fronds, but saw no sign of the Moleman, melted into the shadow already. He reached forward slowly, carefully parting the boughs ahead, and began to work his way to the wall.

Sister Henderson had warned him about Mare. That thought turned in his mind as he crept forward, barely breathing, the trowel heavy and warm in his palm. He'd been too distracted by Alam's grief to think about anything else, even as the Induran insulted him time after time, showing her contempt."
B078FMD5TZ0,B078FMD5TZ,"The dog, who hadn’t left the porch overnight, was watching us intently. He had actually jumped in the back of the Jeep for a moment, then quickly scrambled out.

About that time I saw the owner of the compound headed our way. He glanced at the dog on the porch and made a beeline for him. I was just coming out of the shack with a duffle bag full of tools. As the big guy started up the stairs, that vehement arrogance masking his features, the dog began to back up, but this time (maybe buoyed by our presence), he refused to give up all his ground. He didn’t run. He stood there behind me, holding the doll in his mouth, rolling the dice on his life.

As I watched this take place, I realized that this man was the epitome of a bully — he was angry and he wanted to hurt this creature simply because it had chosen not to be afraid of him this time. I don’t usually pick fights because there’s a standard rule in life: big guys can bluff their way out of an altercation and use their size to intimidate. They only have to actually fight about thirty percent of the time."
B078FMD5TZ1,B078FMD5TZ,"The smell would lead us to it, the owner promised. There was no running water — a well with a hand pump and a faucet was out front. While we talked, I watched the dog circle out of the jungle on the far side of the clearing and cautiously work his way back into the compound.

We settled into our lodgings, bringing the valuable items in the truck inside, then changing into shirts that weren’t caked with dust. When we headed out for dinner, I noticed that the doll on the deck was gone.

Regardless of the label, the rum was probably made in a drum out back. But the cans of Coke made it tolerable, and before long that night, the frond-covered, open-air bar took on a pleasant sparkle. I could just make out a few stars above the compound and somehow a bit of a breeze found us and backed off the mosquitoes. It wasn’t Schooner Wharf in Key West, but with a little rum in me, I was beginning to look forward to a new adventure.

As we sat around our weathered plywood table, I noticed the dog that the landlord had run off had returned to our front porch."
B00452V71A0,B00452V71A,"When the steaks were cooked, we took our plates onto the front porch, where a flimsy table stood on one side. Orson lit two candles with a silver Zippo, and we consumed our dinner in silence. I couldn’t help thinking as I sat across from him, You aren’t that monster I saw on the desert last night. That is how I sit here without trembling or weeping, because somehow I know that cannot be you. You are just Orson. My brother. My blue-eyed twin. I see you as a boy, a sweet, innocuous boy. Not that thing on the desert. Not that demon.

As the last shallow sunbeams retreated below the purple horizon, an ominous feeling took hold of me. The presence of light had afforded me a sense of control, but now, in darkness, I felt defenseless again. For this reason, I hadn’t touched the whiskey after my initial buzz, fearing inebriation could be dangerous here. The silence at the table unnerved me, too. We’d been sitting for twenty minutes without a word, but I wasn’t going to speak. What would I say to him?

Orson had been staring into his plate, but now his eyes fixed on me. He cleared his throat."
B00452V71A1,B00452V71A,"A chain was wrapped snakelike around the latch that connected the double doors. Tire tracks led straight to the shed.

A mile or so beyond, the desert rose several hundred feet to a ridge of rusty bluffs that extended south, sloping gently back to the desert floor. Scraggy junipers lined the top, their jagged silhouettes blackening against the sky.

Since dawn, I’d been trying to read Machiavelli in my room. Hot and unable to concentrate on anything except how I might escape, I’d come outside looking for relief in a breeze. But even in the wind, sweat stung my eyes, moistening my skin and hair. Inside, I heard another jazz record — such an eerie sound track to this empty desert, the music so full, effecting thoughts of crowded New York City clubs and people crammed into compact spaces. Normally, I despise crowds and proximity, but now the claustrophobic confines of a raucous nightclub seemed comforting.

I sat on the steps for the better part of an hour, watching the desert turn scarlet beneath the sun. My mind blanked, and I became so engrossed in the perpetuation of mindlessness that I started when the front door squeaked open behind me. Orson’s boots clunked hollowly against the wood."

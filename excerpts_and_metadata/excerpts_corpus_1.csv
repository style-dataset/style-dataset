B004J4WKUQ0,B004J4WKUQ,"I slipped out the window as quietly as possible and, clutching the bottom of the window frame, slid down the cold surface of the trailer’s metal siding. The steel platform on which the trailer rested was only slightly wider and longer than the trailer itself, leaving a ledge about a foot and a half wide all the way around. I carefully lowered myself until my feet rested on this ledge, then reached up to close the window behind me. I grabbed hold of a rope I’d strung there at waist level to serve as a handhold and began to sidestep along the ledge to the corner of the platform. From there I was able to descend the ladderlike frame of the scaffolding. I almost always took this route when leaving or returning to my aunt’s trailer. A rickety metal staircase was bolted to the side of the stack, but it shook and knocked against the scaffolding, so I couldn’t use it without announcing my presence. Bad news. In the stacks, it was best to avoid being heard or seen, whenever possible. There were often dangerous and desperate people about—the sort who would rob you, rape you, and then sell your organs on the black market."
B004J4WKUQ1,B004J4WKUQ,"Every stack in our park stood at least fifteen mobile homes high (with the occasional RV, shipping container, Airstream trailer, or VW microbus mixed in for variety). In recent years, many of the stacks had grown to a height of twenty units or more. This made a lot of people nervous. Stack collapses weren’t that uncommon, and if the scaffold supports buckled at the wrong angle, the domino effect could bring down four or five of the neighboring stacks too.

Our trailer was near the northern edge of the stacks, which ran up to a crumbling highway overpass. From my vantage point at the laundry room window, I could see a thin stream of electric vehicles crawling along the cracked asphalt, carrying goods and workers into the city. As I stared out at the grim skyline, a bright sliver of the sun peeked over the horizon. Watching it rise, I performed a mental ritual: Whenever I saw the sun, I reminded myself that I was looking at a star. One of over a hundred billion stars in our galaxy. A galaxy that was just one of billions of other galaxies in the observable universe. This helped me keep things in perspective. I’d started doing it after watching a science program from the early ’80s called Cosmos."
B078MHVNWZ0,B078MHVNWZ,"Without comment, he turns me around and walks me back along a new hallway until we come to an open door. He more or less pushes me inside then locks the door behind me.

Now I'm waiting for the daughter I've never met. My hands are sweaty, and my lips feel numb. Scary stuff. I hear the door lock disengage. The door slowly creaks open, and a young woman shuffles inside.

She's wearing Day-Glo orange. Her hair is two braids. Her wrists are manacled and waist-chained. Her feet are chained as well. But the face. That's what makes me almost cry out.

She looks like me. Her mother is black, so there's that, but her features are not her mother's. They are mine. Even the eyes: blue as the sky. She reminds me of Halle Berry; she is that beautiful. I ignore the neck tattoo, the Harley roses. There is no jewelry, of course; that is long gone. She clutches a fat file of papers where her hands are joined by the cuffs. She doesn't look directly at me. Instead, she shuffles to the round steel table and backs onto the bench along the wall. Then she slides her feet and legs in after her. Now she looks up. There is no recognition in her eyes."
B078MHVNWZ1,B078MHVNWZ,"Maybe I just need him to hold my hand while I witness my daughter's execution.

She must have family present when she dies.

As in, me.

DAY 1/30

The next morning, I wake up in Tacoma after the redeye from Spokane last night. My room is in a local hotel. The furniture is itchy and worn. Last night it didn't look so worn. I'm guessing the same is true of me. I have coffee brought to my room, shower and shave and catch a cab to the airport.

I tell my cabbie to wait in line along the loading curb outside the United terminal. Marcel will appear at any second. I cannot afford to miss him because my cases need Marcel if they're ever to gel. My eyes lose their focus, and my head swims. I feel like I'm coming down with something. It again feels like the walls are closing in; I can only imagine what my daughter must be feeling on death row.

Marcel briskly exits the terminal doors, a backpack in one hand, the other pulling his roll-along. He's looking this way and that. I lower the window and wave to him and call. He angles toward my cab."
B007978OY60,B007978OY6,"So do you,’ Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the night.

Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study. A bright fire was on the hearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees’ fingers.

Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour and delight.

He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought. "
B007978OY61,B007978OY6,"It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully.

It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo’s health and doings.

Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar tap on the study window.

Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. "
B00BVFM04C0,B00BVFM04C,"Unlike the traditional designs of submarines, a sphere or globe maintained perfect pressure on all sides as it descended, in essence making the craft stronger the deeper it went. By designing the Triton around such a shape, it was able to reach deeper depths without special efforts to increase body strength required in older tube shapes. The tradeoff, of course, was speed. With more surface area meeting the water while it moved, Clay guessed that the Triton was likely twenty-five percent slower than older models. Nevertheless, with the benefit of a deeper limit without a ship having to carry thousands of feet of thick cable to use as an umbilical cord, he could see why the Triton II was so popular.

Edwin Tay was of Chinese descent and looked to be in his late thirties. He was shorter than the rest of the team but was clearly in charge. He was giving a steady stream of instructions as they smoothly moved the rover out and over the water, suspended by a long, thick articulating arm. He finally turned and motioned for one of his team to lock it in place just moments before the drone of the engines disappeared and the ship began slowing to a stop. "
B00BVFM04C1,B00BVFM04C,"Clay often joked that had he been there; Caesare would have slept through the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

Clay watched through the window as the helicopter dropped closer to sea level. After a few minutes, the pilot leveled off and skimmed the last mile at just under a hundred feet, low enough to see schools of colorful fish below the clear blue water. He slapped Caesare awake and fastened his seat belt.

The helicopter slowed and hovered as it positioned itself over the ship’s black landing pad. It floated close to the deck until the pilot could match the rising and falling of the ship on the ocean swells. Reaching the last few feet, the craft dropped suddenly and bounced onto the pad. An ensign trotted out beneath the slowing blades and pulled the door open. With a quick salute, he unfolded the small set of stairs outward and motioned for Clay and Caesare to follow him.

They grabbed their bags and made their way off the pad and across the deck. After climbing two flights of stairs, they opened a white steel door and stepped onto the bridge.

Captain Emerson looked up as the two men stepped inside.

Emerson grinned and extended his hand to Clay. "
B007978PGI0,B007978PGI,"From the cataclysm there are survivors: Elendil the Fair, chief of the Faithful (his name means Elf-friend), and his sons Isildur and Anarion. Elendil, a Noachian figure, who has held off from the rebellion, and kept ships manned and furnished off the east coast of Númenor, flees before the overwhelming storm of the wrath of the West, and is borne high upon the towering waves that bring ruin to the west of the Middle-earth. He and his folk are cast away as exiles upon the shores. There they establish the Númenórean kingdoms of Arnor in the north close to the realm of Gilgalad, and Gondor about the mouths of Anduin further south. Sauron, being an immortal, hardly escapes the ruin of Númenor and returns to Mordor, where after a while he is strong enough to challenge the exiles of Númenor.

The Second Age ends with the Last Alliance (of Elves and Men), and the great siege of Mordor. It ends with the overthrow of Sauron and destruction of the second visible incarnation of evil. But at a cost, and with one disastrous mistake. Gilgalad and Elendil are slain in the act of slaying Sauron. Isildur, Elendil’s son, cuts the ring from Sauron’s hand, and his power departs, and his spirit flees into the shadows. But the evil begins to work. "
B007978PGI1,B007978PGI,"But there he swiftly rises by his cunning and knowledge from servant to chief counsellor of the king, and seduces the king and most of the lords and people with his lies. He denies the existence of God, saying that the One is a mere invention of the jealous Valar of the West, the oracle of their own wishes. The chief of the gods is he that dwells in the Void, who will conquer in the end, and in the void make endless realms for his servants. The Ban is only a lying device of fear to restrain the Kings of Men from seizing everlasting life and rivalling the Valar.

A new religion, and worship of the Dark, with its temple under Sauron arises. The Faithful are persecuted and sacrificed. The Númenóreans carry their evil also to Middle-earth and there become cruel and wicked lords of necromancy, slaying and tormenting men; and the old legends are overlaid with dark tales of horror. This does not happen, however, in the North West; for thither, because of the Elves, only the Faithful who remain Elf-friends will come. The chief haven of the good Númenóreans is near the mouth of the great river Anduin. Thence the still beneficent influence of Númenor spreads up the River and along the coasts as far north as the realm of Gilgalad, as a Common Speech grows up."
B01L1CEZ6K0,B01L1CEZ6K,"Pino and Mimo were terrified and stuck in the surging mob when, with a deafening roar, a bomb exploded and blew out the theater’s back wall, hurling chunks of debris that ripped the screen to shreds. The lights died.

Something hit Pino hard on the cheek, gashed him open. He felt the wound pulsing and blood dripping over his jaw. In shock now more than in a panic, he choked on smoke and dust and fought his way forward. Grit got in his eyes and up his nostrils, which burned as he and Mimo made their way from the theater, bent over and hacking.

Outside, the sirens wailed on and the bombs kept falling, still far from the crescendo. Fires raged in buildings up and down the street from the theater. Antiaircraft guns rattled. Tracer rounds scrawled red arcs across the sky. Their loads blew so brightly that Pino could see the silhouettes of the Lancaster bombers above him, wingtip to wingtip in a V-formation, like so many dark geese migrating in the night.

More bombs fell with a collective sound like buzzing hornets that erupted one after the other, sending plumes of flame and oily smoke into the sky. Several went off so close to the fleeing Lella boys that they felt the blast waves pound through them and almost lost their balance."
B01L1CEZ6K1,B01L1CEZ6K,"Like all the pharaohs, emperors, and tyrants before him, Il Duce had seen his empire rise only to crumble. Indeed, by that late-spring afternoon, power was bleeding from Benito Mussolini’s grasp like joy from a young widowed heart.

The Fascist dictator’s battered armies had retreated from North Africa. Allied forces were poised off Sicily. And every day, Adolf Hitler was sending more troops and supplies south to fortify the boot of Italy.

Pino Lella knew all this from BBC reports he listened to on his shortwave radio nightly. He’d seen with his own eyes the rising numbers of Nazis everywhere he went. But as he strolled through the medieval streets of Milan, Pino was blissfully ignoring the forces of conflict spiraling his way. World War II was a news dispatch, nothing more, listened to and gone in the very next moment—replaced by thoughts of his three favorite subjects: girls and music and food.

He was only seventeen after all, 1.85 meters tall, seventy-five kilograms, long and gangly, with big hands and feet, hair that defied taming, and enough acne and awkwardness that none of the girls he’d asked to the movies had agreed to accompany him. And yet, as was his nature, Pino remained undeterred."
B06Y5WRS2C0,B06Y5WRS2C,"Days driving in bright sunlight; nights spent camping beside raging rivers and quiet streams, in the shadows of saw-blade mountain peaks, huddled around a fire, spinning dreams of a future that felt closer every day. They roasted hot dogs for dinner and made s’mores for dessert and shared dreams about what they would discover at the end of the road. Leni had never seen her parents so happy. Her dad most of all. He laughed, he smiled, he told jokes and promised them the moon. He was the dad she remembered from Before.

Usually, on road trips, Leni kept her nose buried in a book, but on this trip the scenery had often demanded her attention, especially through the gorgeous mountains of British Columbia. In the ever-changing landscape, she sat in the backseat of the bus, imagining herself as Frodo or Bilbo, the hero of her own quest.

The VW bus thumped over something—a curb, maybe—and stuff went flying inside, dropped to the floor, rolled into the backpacks and boxes that filled the back of the bus. They screeched to a halt that smelled of burnt rubber and exhaust.

Sunlight streamed through the dirty, mosquito-splattered windows. Leni climbed over the heap of their poorly rolled sleeping bags and opened the side door. Their rainbow-decorated ALASKA OR BUST sign fluttered in the cool breeze, the sides anchored in place by duct tape."
B06Y5WRS2C1,B06Y5WRS2C,"Leni looked worriedly at Mama. Dad had never said this before. To hear the words now unsettled them.

He tapped his foot on the floor, played a beat on the table with fast-moving fingers. He unfolded the letter, smoothed it out, and turned it so they could read the words.

Sergeant Allbright—

You are a hard man to find. I am Earl Harlan.

My son, Bo, wrote many letters home about his friendship with you. I thank you for that.

In his last letter, he told me that if anything happened to him in that piece of shit place, he wanted you to have his land up here in Alaska.

It isn’t much. Forty acres with a cabin that needs fixing. But a hardworking man can live off the land up here, away from the crazies and the hippies and the mess in the Lower Forty-eight.

I don’t have no phone, but you can write me c/o the Homer Post Office. I’ll get the letter sooner or later.

The land is at the end of the road, past the silver gate with a cow skull and just before the burnt tree, at mile marker 13.

Thanks again,

Earl

Mama looked up. "
B071LQVXHW0,B071LQVXHW,"One day all the electronic devices would explode at once and set the world on fire. She laughed out loud at the vision of throngs of tourists walking the downtown streets of Charleston with flaming cell phones pressed to their ears. She’d been having the strangest thoughts lately.

One Christmas several years ago, her family gave her a computer, one of the portable kind that you opened up in your lap. She’d taken it back to the Apple Store and gotten an iPad instead. The handheld gadget served its purpose. She was able to get the e-mails she couldn’t avoid—correspondence relating to family business and confirmation notices of her online purchases. Lula loved to shop for china and crystal on eBay. She now had enough of her wedding and holiday patterns to feed twenty-four. One day her daughters would bring home their spouses and offspring for the holidays. She aimed to be prepared for Thanksgiving and Easter and every occasion in between.

Lula took the phone back to the kitchen and collapsed in a chair at the table. She clicked on the missed call. She had to admit that being instantly connected to her loved ones without having to punch the numbers into her wall phone was convenient.

Brooke answered on the first ring. "
B071LQVXHW1,B071LQVXHW,"Walking Pooh to the stop sign at the end of the street and back three times a day offered ample exertion. Anything extra might cause her ticker to tock.

Lula heard her cell phone ringing in a distant part of the house. She froze, listening. She didn’t want to miss the repairman calling to say he was on the way. She’d told the dispatch woman to have him ring her on the house line, but the woman had been too bored to pay attention. She followed the ringing sound through the back hallway to the new part of the house. Despite the cozy feel of the room—the leather-upholstered furniture, thick wool carpet, and stone fireplace—they referred to this space as the Florida room. The large windows allowed sunlight to beam in and provided a lovely view of her perennial garden, now in full bloom, in the tiny backyard.

Her oldest daughter had already hung up by the time Lula located the phone wedged between the sofa cushions. Brooke knew better than to call her on her cell phone. Lula despised modern technology. She preferred paperback copies over e-books. She wanted her mail delivered by the mailman. And she would rather read a road map than listen to an automated voice on a GPS instructing her where to go. "
B07196BC8V0,B07196BC8V,"Johann positioned the lower part in a vise, angled his small chisel, took a hammer in hand, and began tapping out a heart-shaped motif.

The young father lost all notion of time and space as the sky gradually grew light over Altona. Since making his decision to volunteer, he’d hardly slept. Last night, too, he had crept on tiptoe from the bedroom to the workshop with a pot of strong tea. He couldn’t stop thinking of yesterday’s encounter with the young beggar. Martin’s family of six lived in two drafty rooms. His father worked as a day laborer, and his mother still hadn’t fully recovered from giving birth to her latest baby. They had been shaken to the core when Johann told them what had happened. They had no idea their son begged on the street instead of going to school, although they had wondered about the money Martin sometimes claimed to have found.

Johann fell to brooding. A while later, he looked at his watch, quickly covered his work with a soft cloth, climbed the stairs to the storeroom, and filled a basket with flour, salted herring, eggs, and summer vegetables.

He ran into Lotte on the way out. Although she did not show it, he could feel her despair and her anger."
B07196BC8V1,B07196BC8V,"As the cart clattered away, Johann’s eye was caught by a boy of about ten, who was playing harmonica on the other side of the street, a threadbare cap lying at his feet. His shoes were far too big, probably borrowed. Johann had often seen him begging. He had chosen his time of day well, as all of Altona seemed to be afoot, and a few people paused to throw the child a coin.

The little beggar always triggered an uneasy feeling in Johann. Did his parents know what he was doing out on the streets? The boy seemed to sense he was being watched, and looked up. When Johann nodded to him, he quickly tucked the harmonica away in his pocket.

A gang of adolescents appeared, crowding around him and laughing raucously. They shoved the child down onto the wet pavement. Horrified, Johann moved closer to the window. One of the attackers took the opportunity to give the boy a kick in the stomach. As he doubled up with pain, another grabbed him by the hair. Johann seized his walking stick and hurried out. As soon as the gang saw him, his stick raised menacingly, they made to leave, but Johann managed to plant himself in their way. "
B07BQCP82B0,B07BQCP82B,"But there’s no way to go about it discreetly when you’re the President of the United States. The media scrutiny would scare anyone in their right mind off, and besides, a lot of women don’t want to date politicians. Not the good ones at least. So Gold Medallion meets my needs in a very specific way, and my employees are always sifting through submissions. A team reviews any potential women before presenting me with a select number of candidates, and then I go from there.

And Bridget stood out. I’m used to seeing beautiful women smiling at me from their headshots, not to mention women who have resumes worthy of a Nobel scientist. There are ladies who have graduate degrees up the wazoo, who can speak five languages and also communicate via sign language with monkeys. But I’m not into that because deep down, I’m still Robbie Carter from Arkansas, and a woman who has too much going on isn’t my type. I don’t want someone who’s done everything right in life. God knows I’ve made a lot of mistakes to get where I am. So instead, someone real and sassy, with curves and a good sense of humor is what I’m looking for."
B07BQCP82B1,B07BQCP82B,"They photoshopped some penguins in, and also the Taj Mahal and the Kremlin. They should have included a pic of the White House. That would have been more accurate at least.

But Robert’s my avatar, and not a bad one. He’s a guy who looks kinda like me what with the dark hair and blue eyes, but he’s a model and nothing else. He’s a stand-in for the real thing, which is Robert Carter from Little Rock, Arkansas. I’ve been a politician since I was old enough to run for president of my high school class, and once bitten by the bug, I couldn’t stop. So I went from state representative to U.S. Senator, Governor, and now finally President.

It’s not bad, to be honest. After all, being Commander-in-Chief has been my desire since I was about ten years old. But the path hasn’t been easy and it hasn’t left a lot of time for dating. Anyone who knows me knows that I’m traveling non-stop, the interior of Air Force One my real home.

So yeah, Gold Medallion was set up to service my needs. After all, I function best when I have release, just like any other alpha male. "
B00K0OI42W0,B00K0OI42W,"I never looked forward more to anything in my life. Hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem had given me, learning their games, following Jem’s red jacket through wriggling circles of blind man’s buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories. I longed to join them.

Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by one’s parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jem’s pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth. "
B00K0OI42W1,B00K0OI42W,"Boo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he didn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county.

Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time. Atticus said no, it wasn’t that sort of thing, that there were other ways of making people into ghosts.

My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I would see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we believed her, because Mr. Radley’s posture was ramrod straight.

He never spoke to us. "
B01M1G2SV60,B01M1G2SV6,"This could be a job she could actually enjoy and take pride in.

Light streamed into the temple through its wide windows, splashing the tiled floor with brief warmth before a patch of clouds rushed to conceal the sun. Just as Nikki was about to leave the building, she finally received a reply to her earlier message to Olive.

Where’s Southall?

The question surprised Nikki. Surely in their years of friendship, Nikki had mentioned Southall to Olive? Then again, she and Olive had met in secondary school, years after Nikki’s parents had deemed these Punjabi day trips too much trouble, so Olive was spared Nikki’s complaints about wasting a perfectly good Saturday on the hunt for high quality coriander powder and mustard seeds.

Nikki stopped and looked around. She was surrounded by women with their heads covered – women hurrying after their toddlers, women giving each other sideways glances, women hunched over walking frames. Each one had a story. She could see herself addressing a room full of these Punjabi women. Her senses became overwhelmed with the colour of their kameezes, the sound of fabric rustling and pencils tapping, the smell of perfume and turmeric. Her purpose came into sharp focus. "
B01M1G2SV61,B01M1G2SV6,"Then a flyer caught her eye. She stopped and read it quietly to herself, her eyes moving slowly over the words.

Writing Classes: Register Now!

Ever wanted to write? A new workshop on narrative techniques, character and voice. Tell your story! Workshops will culminate in an anthology of best work.

A handwritten scrawl below the print read: Class open to women only. Instructor needed. Paid position, two days weekly. Please contact Kulwinder Kaur at the Sikh Community Association.

There was no mention of qualifications or prior experience, which was an encouraging sign. Nikki pulled out her phone and typed in the phone number to save it. She noticed the man’s curious gaze but she ignored him and fell in step with a current of worshippers who had emerged from the langar hall.

Could she run a writing workshop? She had contributed a piece to the UK Fem Fighters’ blog, comparing her experiences with catcalling in Delhi and London, which had enjoyed three days on the Most Read Posts list. Surely she could give writing tips to some temple women? Perhaps publish An Anthology of Best Work. Editorial credentials would sit well on her bare résumé. Hope flittered in her chest. "
B003VPWX6K0,B003VPWX6K,"Naturally, I felt the temptation to deny immediately and unambiguously such motivations as my employer was imputing to me, but saw in time that to do so would be to rise to Mr Farraday’s bait, and the situation would only become increasingly embarrassing. I therefore continued to stand there awkwardly, waiting for my employer to give me permission to undertake the motoring trip.

Embarrassing as those moments were for me, I would not wish to imply that I in any way blame Mr Farraday, who is in no sense an unkind person; he was, I am sure, merely enjoying the sort of bantering which in the United States, no doubt, is a sign of a good, friendly understanding between employer and employee, indulged in as a kind of affectionate sport. Indeed, to put things into a proper perspective, I should point out that just such bantering on my new employer’s part has characterized much of our relationship over these months – though I must confess, I remain rather unsure as to how I should respond. In fact, during my first days under Mr Farraday, I was once or twice quite astounded by some of the things he would say to me. For instance, I once had occasion to ask him if a certain gentleman expected at the house was likely to be accompanied by his wife."
B003VPWX6K1,B003VPWX6K,"But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part, in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer, to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request. So it was that in indicating my reasons for preferring the West Country for my motoring, instead of leaving it at mentioning several of the alluring details as conveyed by Mrs Symons’s volume, I made the error of declaring that a former housekeeper of Darlington Hall was resident in that region. I suppose I must have been intending to explain to Mr Farraday how I would thus be able to explore an option which might prove the ideal solution to our present small problems here in this house. It was only after I had mentioned Miss Kenton that I suddenly realized how entirely inappropriate it would be for me to continue. Not only was I unable to be certain of Miss Kenton’s desire to rejoin the staff here, I had not, of course, even discussed the question of additional staff with Mr Farraday since that first preliminary meeting over a year ago. To have continued pronouncing aloud my thoughts on the future of Darlington Hall would have been, to say the very least, presumptuous. I suspect, then, that I paused rather abruptly and looked a little awkward. "
B0192CTMYG0,B0192CTMYG,"In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.

Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. "
B0192CTMYG1,B0192CTMYG,"Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it.

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them. . . .

How very wrong he was.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. "
B07B3FCTHN0,B07B3FCTHN,"Except… he no longer looked like the kid I had saved. Somehow, he was now a tall, strapping twenty-year-old. His dark hair and dark eyes didn’t scream bad boy – but he seemed like the guy who would steal the bad boy’s lunch money. Changed, I thought to myself as I let my eyes roam.

The Huntress – an assassin who had worked for Rumpelstiltskin – once an enemy, but now friend, and babysitter for Alex – not that he needed that kind of help any longer. She was watching Alex out of the corner of her eye, and she looked deeply concerned. Troubled. Change.

Alucard – once an enemy vampire – now a Daywalker, and ally. Change.

I realized everyone was staring at me, and that they probably mistook my silence for aloof drunkenness. I sighed. Damn stereotypes. I stood, clearing my throat. I turned to Ashley and Gunnar, opened my mouth to speak and… the words died on my tongue. Because they were staring at me, and the compassion in their eyes told me that nothing needed to be said.

At least between us three.

But the crowd did need to hear something.

I turned to the crowd."
B07B3FCTHN1,B07B3FCTHN,"I’d said it all before, and this was their wedding. It felt hollow to repeat the same platitudes here, now.

All too soon, Tory wrapped up and the guests gave light applause. Ashley’s eyes were misty and Gunnar was smiling at Tory.

Tory had grown a lot since we first met – that night on the Eads Bridge where we had fought against a silver dragon during a high-speed car chase. Tory had never seen a dragon before, but that hadn’t stopped her from doing her best to help Gunnar and I kick its ass. Afterwards, Tory had taken the biggest risk of her life and revealed her powers to the two strangers who had saved her. She’d bent a thick bar of metal as easily as a clothes hanger, and we had officially adopted her into our new club. Just the three of us back then. And look at how big our club was now.

My gaze swept the room, picking out several faces.

Alex – the kid we had saved from the Land of the Fae – a victim of the changeling operation the Queens still practiced. We had saved him, and then I had kind of adopted him. "
B079WCFZB80,B079WCFZB8,"He could go down that rabbit hole forever and keep falling. No, he had to focus on what he knew.

What he knew was that Ran’dolphinius had in all likelihood saved lives in the village with his contributions. The chamberlain had made sure that hundreds of people had been fed, clothed and sheltered for months. He had been a blessing to the Mist Village.

There was also the point that Richter wouldn’t even be facing this choice if Ran’dolphinius hadn’t decided to be honest with him. The man had shown him trust. It might just be the Universe exerting its hidden rules, forcing the Spy to come clean since their official relationship had improved from Admiring to Trusting. Even if that was true though, it didn’t mean that Randy’s regret for deceiving him wasn’t real. On the contrary, it might just ensure that the man was telling the truth.

Of course, the most important thing was the Blood Oath. Richter had made one himself, and the consequences for failure were severe. His Oath hadn’t even involved calling on the Universe or a Place of Power. Words had power. With what Ran’dolphinius had just promised, Richter couldn’t even imagine what the consequences of breaking such an Oath would be…"
B079WCFZB81,B079WCFZB8,"The eye of the Universe looked down upon him and the strings of fate drew taut as they awaited his decision. A pattern of importance would be woven into the skein of history tonight, and the tapestry would change based on his response.

Richter felt the import and yet still took his time to think. The Spy had been right, he had learned the importance of words in The Land, and he would not rush judgement in such an important moment. On the one hand, Ran’dolphinius had deceived him. The man wasn’t even human, and Undines weren’t even a race he was familiar with. A half-elf, or even a half-orc, wouldn’t be a person he would dismiss out of hand. But what if Randolphus - Ran’dolphinius, Richter corrected himself again - thought in an alien way because he was half-elemental? Did that make him half-monster?

Perhaps even more troubling was the second Oath that the chamberlain couldn’t tell him about. It was more than just a small cause for concern. What if that Oath was something horrible like killing all humans? What if it was to infiltrate other villages and kingdoms, being loyal until he could sell them out to Yves? The man was a damn Spy, after all. Not trusting him was kind of in the name."
B06WP486XH0,B06WP486XH,"Maybe a very bad day.

But who cared, really?

The seven guys fanned out in a semicircle, three on Jimmy Rat’s left, and three on his right. Reacher kept moving, rotating them the way he wanted, his back to the street. He didn’t want to get trapped against someone’s rear fence. He didn’t want to get jammed in a corner. He didn’t plan on running, but an option was always a fine thing to have.

The seven guys tightened their semicircle, but not enough. They stayed about ten feet away, with better than a yard between each one of them. Which made the first two plays obvious. They would come shuffling in, slowly, maybe grunting and glaring, whereupon Reacher would move fast and punch his way through the line, after which everyone would turn around, Reacher now facing a new inverted semicircle, now only six in number. Then rinse and repeat, which would reduce them to five. They wouldn’t fall for it a third time, so at that point they would swarm, all except Jimmy Rat, who Reacher figured wouldn’t fight at all. Too smart. Which in the end would make it a close-quarters four-on-one brawl.

A bad day.

For someone."
B06WP486XH1,B06WP486XH,"It was as huge as all the others, but the footrests and the handlebars were set a little closer to the seat than most. About two inches closer than the new guy’s, for example. Which made Jimmy Rat about five-eight, possibly. Maybe skinny, to go with his name. Maybe armed, with a knife or a gun. Maybe vicious.

Reacher walked to the door of the bar. He pulled it open and stepped inside. The air was dark and hot and smelled of spilled beer. The room was rectangular, with a full-length copper bar on the left, and tables on the right. There was an arch in the rear wall, with a narrow corridor beyond. Restrooms and a pay phone and a fire door. Four windows. A total of six potential exits. The first thing an ex-MP counted.

The eight bikers were packed in around two four-tops shoved together by a window. They had beers on the go, in heavy glasses wet with humidity. The new guy was shoehorned in, pear shaped on a chair, with the fullest glass. Six of the others were in a similar category, in terms of size and shape and general visual appeal. One was worse. About five-eight, stringy, with a narrow face and restless eyes."
B00NRQORA80,B00NRQORA8,"For clients like the Lius, Corinna did everything from refining the art on their walls to the clothes on their back—all in service of getting them memberships at the most elite clubs, their names onto the right invitation lists, and their children into the city’s top schools. In short, she was a special consultant for social climbers.

Corinna spotted the Lius as they ascended the short flight of stairs up to the mezzanine lounge overlooking the lobby. The couple cut quite a striking picture, and she had to pat herself on the back for this. The first time Corinna met the Lius, they were both in head-to-toe Prada. To these new arrivals from Guangdong, it was the height of sophistication, but to Corinna, it just screamed clueless Mainland money. Thanks to her handiwork, Lester entered the Clipper Lounge looking particularly dapper in a bespoke three-piece suit from Kilgour of Savile Row, and Valerie was chicly clad in a silvery Persian lamb parka from J. Mendel, appropriately sized black pearls, and dove-gray suede Lanvin ankle boots. But there was something a little off about her outfit—the handbag was a mistake. The glossy ombré-dyed reptile-skin bag obviously came from some nearly extinct species, but it reminded Corinna of the sort of handbag only a mistress would carry. She made a mental note to drop a hint at the appropriate moment."
B00NRQORA81,B00NRQORA8,"As staffers scurried around unrolling the scrolls, they discovered twenty-four pieces, each almost seven feet tall and in immaculate condition. Placed side by side, they spanned thirty-seven feet, almost filling the floor space of two workrooms. At last, the senior specialist could confirm that this was undoubtedly the mythical work described in all the classical Chinese texts he had spent much of his career studying.

The Palace of Eighteen Perfections was an opulent eighth-century imperial retreat in the mountains north of modern-day Xi’an. It was said to be one of the most magnificent royal residences ever built, with grounds so vast that one had to travel between the halls on horseback. On these ancient silk scrolls, the intricate pavilions, courtyards, and gardens that meandered through a dreamlike blue-and-green mountain landscape were painted in colors so vibrantly preserved, they seemed almost electric in their iridescence.

The auction-house staff stood over the exquisite masterpiece in awed silence. A find of this caliber was like discovering a long-hidden painting by da Vinci or Vermeer. When the international director of Asian Art rushed in to see them, he began to feel faint and forced himself to take a few steps back for fear that he might fall onto the delicate artwork. "
B07B42T4YD0,B07B42T4YD,"Judging by the eleven bandits it had silently disposed of just a while ago, Boxxy concluded they were tougher than the rabble it had dealt with until now. It estimated their Levels to be around 30 or 35 to 40 at most. But even if they were stronger than the other prey it had faced so far, hiding out among the tree branches and watching the caravan with a keen eye made them easy pickings. In the end, all their higher Levels did for them was raise the Mimic’s Job and Skill Levels as it quietly picked them off one by one.

But it appeared that a few of the rats were making their escape. The Mass Panic Spell Crystal was a bit too effective and had made them abandon what loyalty they had in favour of running for their lives. The Mimic would therefore have to hunt them down and kill them. After all, the last time it let someone escape like this, the result was a punitive force being organized to hunt it down. Needless to say, it wanted to avoid a repeat of that situation, as it might not escape with its life the next time around."
B07B42T4YD1,B07B42T4YD,"It then cracked open and released a wailing, piercing screech that was loud enough to rock one to their core.

[Proficiency level increased. Crystallize Magic is now Level 2. INT +2. WIS +2.]

Boxxy was extremely satisfied with the results of its first field test of the crystallized Mass Panic Spell. The spike in MP cost was well worth the additional range the combination afforded. The duration of the effect was somewhat random since it varied from person to person. At the very least it stuck to a range between five and eight seconds, so it wasn’t entirely unpredictable.

As for the actual impact the Spell was having on the Mimic’s targets, it was just as tasty as the monster expected."
B01HMXRVL80,B01HMXRVL8,".

A-ma takes the chicken from the ruma and swiftly plucks the feathers from the twitching carcass. Then whack, whack, whack. The chicken pieces are thrown into the pot that dangles over the fire First Sister-in-law has been tending.

Twenty minutes later, A-ma ladles the soup into bowls. The men gather on one side of our family home; the women gather on the other side. We sit on our haunches to receive our bowls. The sounds of greedy slurping, sucking, and chewing are among the happiest I’ve heard in my life, yet frogs, mosquitoes, and night-calling birds alert me to how many sleep hours we’ve already missed. As I gnaw gristle from a bone, little sparks of ideas fly through my head. In my dream last night, the bad omen of seeing a dog on the roof told me I was going to get into trouble. And I did. But right now, in this second, each person in my family, as well as the ruma, has a piece of chicken to eat and rich broth to drink. That’s just like in my dream too. My fake dream . . . The one I lied about . . . But in that dream we each had a whole chicken. Still . . ."
B01HMXRVL81,B01HMXRVL8,"First Brother holds the chicken by its legs. Its wings flap miserably, fruitlessly. The village elders—who lead us and care for us—step onto their verandas and descend the stairs. Soon other neighbors emerge from their homes and join us, because I’m not to be alone in my disgrace.

I see the blacksmith and his family, the best hunter and his family, Ci-teh and her parents, and Ci-teh’s brother and his wife—Ci-do and Deh-ja—who sleep in the newlywed hut outside his parents’ house. Ci-do has always been nice to me, and I like Deh-ja. The hair on Ci-do’s face and scalp has grown long and unruly, because men must not shave or cut their hair once their wives are five months into their pregnancies. Our entire village is holding its collective breath—as it does every time a woman is pregnant—until Deh-ja’s baby is born, when it can be determined whether it was a good birth, meaning a perfect baby boy or even a girl, and not a bad birth, marking the arrival of what we call a human reject.

The ruma’s eyes bore into mine. He starts to shake, and the little pieces on his headdress and clothes rattle with him. "
B000FBFMB60,B000FBFMB6,"The surgery was held at the edge of the big clearing at the foot of the hill, where the great fire of the Gathering burned at night. The damp air smelled of soot and the acrid scent of wet ashes, but the blackened patch of earth—some ten feet across, at least—was already disappearing under a crisscross of fresh branches and kindling. They’d have a time starting it tonight, I thought, if the drizzle kept up.

The gentleman with the hangover disposed of, there was a short lull, and I was able to give my attention to Murray MacLeod, who had set up shop a short distance away.

Murray had gotten an early start, I saw; the ground by his feet was dark, the scattered ashes sodden and squishy with blood. He had an early patient in hand, too—a stout gentleman whose red, spongy nose and flabby jowls gave testimony to a life of alcoholic excess. He had the man stripped to his shirt despite the rain and cold, sleeve turned up and tourniquet in place, the bleeding bowl held across the patient’s knees.

I was a good ten feet from the stool where Murray plied his trade, but could see the man’s eyes, yellow as mustard even in the dim morning light."
B000FBFMB61,B000FBFMB6,"Still, Brianna was very healthy, and while we did lack important things like antibiotics and sophisticated medical facilities, I had told her not to underestimate the power of simple hygiene and good nutrition.

No, I thought, watching the strong curve of her back as she lifted the heavy equipment over an entangling root that hunched across the trail. It wasn’t that. She might have reason to be concerned, but she wasn’t basically a fearful person.

Roger? On the face of it, it would seem that the best thing to do was to become pregnant again quickly, with a child that was definitely Roger’s. That would certainly help to cement their new marriage. On the other hand … what if she did? Roger would be more than pleased— but what about Jemmy?

Roger had sworn a blood oath, taking Jemmy as his own. But human nature was human nature, and while I was sure that Roger would never abandon or neglect Jemmy, it was quite possible that he would feel differently—and obviously differently—for a child he knew was his. Would Bree risk that?

On due consideration, I rather thought she was wise to wait—if she could. Give Roger time to feel a close bond with Jemmy, before complicating the family situation with another child. Yes, very sensible—and Bree was an eminently sensible person."
B071W7C2CG0,B071W7C2CG,"Wearing dresses with crinoline underskirts peeking out at the hem, thick silk sashes, high necklines with lace collars, and wide pagoda sleeves, the girls had clothes finer and more fashionable than anything I’d ever owned. Finer than anything I’d ever seen, in fact, except the two occasions I served as a temporary kitchen maid for a holiday meal at Castle Martyn, the medieval citadel owned by the Martyn family, who served as landlord to all the farmers in our region.

Who in the name of Mary was this Clara Kelley I’d become?

From their gawking, I saw that the girls found me as alien as I found them. But I could not let on, or I risked losing my place in the carriage. How could I best ensure that I stepped into the mysterious shoes that the other Clara left me to fill?

Not by speaking in my usual manner, that was for certain. These girls didn’t look as though their accents would match my farmer’s daughter’s West Ireland lilt, no matter how posh our fellow neighbors found it compared to their own, thanks to Dad’s education of us girls. And I guessed the other Clara Kelley spoke like them. Not me.

Mrs. Seeley’s man poked his head into the carriage."
B071W7C2CG1,B071W7C2CG,"I’d assumed I would have to cobble together the cheapest route I could find, some combination of rail and canal rides and wagon, since the train route didn’t extend all the way from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. But now a complete stranger was offering me a continuous horse-drawn carriage ride across the Allegheny Mountains and seemingly not asking for payment. Would I be a fool to decline? Or would I be a fool to accept?

I had a choice. I could tell this man the truth. That I was not the Clara Kelley for whom he was looking. That Clara Kelley was a common enough name. That the second-class passenger Clara Kelley for whom he was waiting probably never made it off the ship ferrying her here from Ireland if he had not yet come across her. Cholera and typhoid took many of us from all classes of travel. Illness did not discriminate. It was perhaps the one thing that did not.

Or I could become that other Clara Kelley. At least until I got to Pittsburgh.

I stared at the black carriage, trying to decide. On board the Envoy, I had promised myself that I wouldn’t wait any longer, that I would take my future in my own hands when I could."
B06W9HYRX10,B06W9HYRX1,"Money, more likely. Alcohol. Madness. The day and time itself: late afternoon in early February, was there a moment of the year better suited for despair? Sister herself had had the very same thought earlier today, during her long hours of begging in the drafty vestibule. We’re all feeling it, she’d thought—we being all who passed along the street and in and out of the store, wet-shouldered, stooped, all who saw her and pretended not to, all who scowled and all (though not very many on this dank day) who reached into a pocket or a purse as they approached—we’re all feeling it, she’d thought, in this vale of tears: the weight of the low sky and the listless rain and the damp depths of this endless winter, the sour smell of the vestibule, the brimstone breath of the subway, of the copper coins, the cold that slips in behind your spine and hollows you out at the core. Six and a half hours she’d sat begging today, so weighted by the weather and the time of year that she’d been unable to stir herself from her perch to face the daily humiliation of making use of the store’s public stalls. "
B06W9HYRX11,B06W9HYRX1,"It was a flimsy thing, woven of unblessed palms, and much worse the wear for being crushed against her body so long. She straightened and reshaped it a bit, catching as she did the green scent that the warmth of her own flesh and the work of her hands could sometimes coax from the dried reeds. She placed the basket on the table beside the bed and untied the money pouch from her belt. It was all coins today, mostly pennies. She placed the pouch in the basket and then sat carefully on the side of the bed, her kidneys aching, her feet throbbing inside her shoes. She looked at the girl’s form, the length of her back and the curve of her young hip, her thin legs beneath the wide skirt. Suddenly the girl turned in the bed and threw herself into Sister’s lap, weeping.

Sister St. Saviour put her hand to the girl’s dark hair. It was thick, and soft as silk. A thing of luxurious beauty. Sister lifted the heavy knot of it that was coming undone at the nape of her neck and brushed a strand from her cheek.

This much the nun was certain of: the husband had cherished this girl with the beautiful hair. Love was not the trouble. "
B011G3HI9U0,B011G3HI9U,"The French ocean liners sailed up the Hudson River and docked at Fifty-first Street, so some of New York’s best little places popped up near there, like chanterelles after a good rain. Le Grenier lived in the shadow of the SS Normandie, in the attic of a former harbormaster’s building. When we exited the cab, the great ship rose high above us, deck bright with spotlights, four floors of portholes aglow. A welder at her bow sent apricot sparks into the night sky as deckhands lowered a spotlight down her side to painters on a scaffold. She made me feel small standing there, below that great, black prow, her three red smokestacks, each bigger than any of the warehouse buildings that extended down the pier. Salt hung in the end-of-summer air as Atlantic seawater met Hudson River fresh.

The tables at Le Grenier were packed with a nice enough looking crowd, mostly middle-class types, including a reporter from the gala and what looked like ocean-liner passengers happy to be on terra firma. We chose a tight, shellacked wooden booth, built like something from the inside of a ship, where every inch counts. Le Grenier’s maître d’, M. Bernard, fawned over M. Rodierre, told him he’d seen The Streets of Paris three times, and shared in great detail the specifics of his own Hoboken Community Theater career."
B011G3HI9U1,B011G3HI9U,"Fearing I’d only antagonize him further, I left M. Rodierre and the script backstage, trying to dismiss my brown-suede-shoe fixation. I hurried to the ballroom to see if Pia had executed my seating chart, more detailed and dangerous than a Luftwaffe flight plan. I saw she’d simply tossed several cards onto the six Rockefeller tables, so I rearranged them and took my place close to the stage between the kitchen and the head table. Three stories of red-draped boxes rose up around the vast room, each with its own dinner table. All seventeen hundred seats would be filled, a lot of unhappy people if all didn’t go well.

The guests assembled and took their seats, an ocean of white ties, old mine diamonds, and enough rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré gowns to clean out most of Paris’s best shops. The girdles alone would ensure both Bergdorf and Goodman reached their third-quarter sales goals.

A row of journalists collected alongside me, pulling their pencils out from behind their ears. The headwaiter stood poised at my elbow, awaiting the cue to serve. Elsa Maxwell entered the room—gossipmonger, professional party hostess, and self-promoter ne plus ultra. Would she remove her gloves to write terrible things about this night in her column or just memorize the horror of it all?"
B073VXTLJV0,B073VXTLJV,"She looked around the room and thought of taking her children, the recent children, to these same galleries years ago. She remembered that unexpected sense of comfort in standing among these ruins, an inexpressible relief that she couldn’t explain even to herself. Naturally Elazar understood it immediately. He always noticed patterns, and their absence. He used to open up her father’s scrolls in front of her, noting oddities. Why did he write here that there were seven of every clean animal in the ark, but in the previous column he wrote that there were only two? A simple mistake like that, can’t he change it? Tell him we want a corrected copy. She would read over his shoulder, follow, argue. You want it to be perfect, but that’s not the point, she would insist, but still she brought the scrolls and questions back to her father. It’s not my job to change it, her father would mutter—though she knew he did change things sometimes, when he felt he had to. And not his either. Go tell him to learn from his own father. He’s inheriting a far more important job than mine. Her father was right about that, of course: deeply, profoundly right. Until he wasn’t. "
B073VXTLJV1,B073VXTLJV,"She didn’t know exactly when she had first felt the sensation of regret. It was a physical sensation, a shudder that began deep in the stomach and traveled up through the throat; it was distinct from remorse, which one felt first in the throat and only later in the gut. Yet it was regret that she couldn’t handle. She did anything she could to avoid it—including the initial bargain, the one that began everything. And now this one.

Meet me in twenty minutes, the text on her phone read. You know where.

She knew, of course. No, she tapped back. Not now.

Now, the text replied.

This was the problem, always. And all this time she had never found a way out. More words appeared on the phone’s screen, unbidden: Unless you want me to come to you.

No thank you, she responded. Wait for me. I’ll come. She always did.

He had found her coming out of the office one cold evening when she had been working alone. Mort was dead three years already, the business was just beginning to fail, and she was thinking about leaving. But she couldn’t leave just then, just when everyone and everything was poised at the edge of ruin; she couldn’t do that to them. "
B000FC2L1Y0,B000FC2L1Y,"Small clouds of gnats hovered over the water; I couldn’t see them, but I knew they were there by the occasional splash of leaping fish, rising to snatch them from the air.

The bugs had been a ubiquitous plague. I inspected Jamie’s skin minutely every morning, picking voracious ticks and wood fleas from his crevices, and anointed all of the men liberally with the juice of crushed pennyroyal and tobacco leaves. This kept them from being devoured alive by the clouds of mosquitoes, gnats, and carnivorous midges that hung in the sun-tinged shadows of the woods, but it didn’t prevent the hordes of inquisitive bugs from driving them mad with a constant tickling inquiry into ears, eyes, noses, and mouths.

Oddly enough, the majority of insects left me strictly alone. Ian joked that the strong scent of herbs that hung about me must repel them, but I thought it went further than that—even when I was freshly bathed, the insects showed no desire to bother me.

I thought it might be a manifestation of the evolutionary oddity that— I surmised—protected me from colds and minor illness here. Bloodthirsty bugs, like microbes, evolved very closely with humans, and were sensitive to the subtle chemical signals of their hosts. "
B000FC2L1Y1,B000FC2L1Y,"The night was quiet and still, but with a languid atmosphere that was like floating in a warm sea. So near the coast, the sky was clear, and the stars shone overhead like diamonds, burning with a fierce, bright light.

A faint splash made me look toward the stream. Nothing moved on the surface but faint coruscations of starlight, caught like fireflies in a spider’s web.

As I watched, a great head broke water in the middle of the stream, water purling back from the pointed snout. There was a fish struggling in Rollo’s jaws; the flap and gleam of its scales showed briefly as he shook his head violently to break its back. The huge dog swam slowly to the shore, shook his coat briefly, and stalked away, his evening meal dangling limp and shimmering from his jaws.

He paused for a moment on the far edge of the creek, looking at me, the ruff of his hackles a dark shadow framing yellow eyes and gleaming fish. Like a primitive painting, I thought; something from Rousseau, with its contrast of utter wildness and complete stillness.

Then the dog was gone, and there was nothing on the far shore but the trees, hiding whatever might lie behind them. And what did ? I wondered. "
B01N4VW75U0,B01N4VW75U,"The upstairs had had a new tenant every year or so: a cellist who had just been hired to teach at the Institute of Music; a divorcée in her forties; a young newlywed couple fresh out of Cleveland State. Each of them had deserved a little booster, as she’d begun to think of it. But none of them stayed long. The cellist, denied first chair in the Cleveland Orchestra, left the city in a cloud of bitterness. The divorcée remarried after a whirlwind four-month romance and moved with her new husband to a brand-new McMansion in Lakewood. And the young couple, who had seemed so sincere, so devoted, and so deeply in love, had quarreled irreparably and separated after a mere eighteen months, leaving a broken lease, some shattered vases, and three cracked spots in the wall, head-high, where those vases had shattered.

It was a lesson, Mrs. Richardson had decided. This time she would be more careful. She asked Mr. Yang to patch the plaster and took her time finding a new tenant, the right sort of tenant. 18434 Winslow Road Up sat empty for nearly six months until Mia Warren and her daughter came along. A single mother, well spoken, artistic, raising a daughter who was polite and fairly pretty and possibly brilliant."
B01N4VW75U1,B01N4VW75U,"Over the years his accent had diminished only marginally, and when they spoke, Mrs. Richardson was sometimes reduced to nodding and smiling. But Mr. Yang was a good man, she felt; he worked very hard, driving a school bus to Laurel Academy, a nearby private girls’ school, and working as a handyman. Living alone on such a meager income, he would never have been able to live in such a nice neighborhood. He would have ended up in a cramped, gray efficiency somewhere off Buckeye Road, or more likely in the gritty triangle of east Cleveland that passed for a Chinatown, where rent was suspiciously low, every other building was abandoned, and sirens wailed at least once a night. Plus, Mr. Yang kept the house in impeccable shape, repairing leaky faucets, patching the front concrete, and coaxing the stamp-sized backyard into a lush garden. Every summer he brought her Chinese melons he had grown, like a tithe, and although Mrs. Richardson had no idea what to do with them—they were jade green, wrinkled, and disconcertingly fuzzy—she appreciated his thoughtfulness anyway. Mr. Yang was exactly the kind of tenant Mrs. Richardson wanted: a kind person to whom she could do a kind turn, and who would appreciate her kindness.

With the upstairs apartment she had been less successful. "
B077V6QBZR0,B077V6QBZR,"My tone is pure challenge, more suited to the rebellious teen of my misspent youth than the professional woman I am today.

It must be the right answer, though, because it unleashes the beast behind me. My stranger draws back before fucking into me with a measured rhythm of deep and then shallow strokes. He relentlessly hits the spots that light my body up. The man has skills.

It’s the last coherent thought I have as my fingers tighten around the edge of the desk. My head begs to thrash from side to side but is pinned in place by his hand.

He’s taking me. Owning me. Dominating me. Leaving me no choice but to take the fucking he’s delivering.

And I love it.

Another orgasm builds and threatens to shatter my grip, and when he changes his pattern, my body is thrown into a new level of chaos.

Thrust after thrust, I can’t even understand the babbling words spilling from my lips.

I can’t stop coming. These aren’t multiples . . . they’re continuous, and I’m a writhing, moaning body without any coherent thought beyond— don’t stop.

He doesn’t. My control shatters along with my grip.

The blood pounding through my head deafens me, but not enough to miss his roar of ecstasy just before he thrusts slow and shallow."
B077V6QBZR1,B077V6QBZR,"A tingle of excitement, like I’ve just discovered a secret key to another world, shoots through me as the man shuts the door to their room and slowly circles the woman before pushing her to her knees with one dominant hand on each shoulder. He has the look of a conqueror inspecting his war prize, complete with tribal ink marking his chest and upper arms, and dark leather pants. It’s hot as hell.

The rational part of my brain says I should look away, not invade their private scene, but I glance quickly at the door I entered through. No one is bursting in to tell me it’s some kind of mistake that I was led here.

The woman, dressed in red lingerie, keeps her gaze downcast, but I’m not nearly as disciplined. I can’t take my eyes off her companion as his ass flexes against the leathers.

When he stops in front of her, he releases her shoulder and buries one hand in her honey-blond hair, gripping her at the base of her neck, forcing her attention to his face.

They are completely and utterly absorbed with each other, and neither of them spares even a glance at the wall that serves as my voyeuristic porthole. Do they know? They must."
B01K3WN90C0,B01K3WN90C,"But ask them what they think of the war in Syria and they’ll stare at you as if you’d just asked them to explain the theory of relativity. A handful of fish floating belly-up are a thousand times worse than a busload of women and children blown to smithereens in some far-off country.

But let’s not be hypocritical: I am enjoying the fish scandal immensely, I cannot pretend otherwise. The outrage that has overtaken the entire population here is remarkable. I’m about to go back down to the Conversation Lounge for some more juicy fish talk.

Winter has arrived. Not a flake of snow on the ground, but yesterday I saw the first old man stepping outside with wool socks pulled on over his shoes. To guard against slipping.

Tuesday, January 15

Here it is, the first snowfall of the year. Which means nobody ventures outside, and everyone’s stocking up on provisions. In our little shop downstairs there’s not a packet of cookies or bar of chocolate to be had anymore. The war, you know.

It’s lucky for today’s young people that we are just about the only ones left who’ve lived through the war; soon they won’t have to put up with any more old-fogeys’ tales about tulip-bulb soup and having to walk seven hours for a bunch of carrots."
B01K3WN90C1,B01K3WN90C,"Evert simply excused himself during after-dinner coffee, announcing he was going to the bathroom, then climbed the stairs, peering around to make sure no one saw him, and chucked the cakes he’d been hiding under his jacket into the water. He deposited the plastic wrapper neatly in the wastepaper basket—not such a bright way to dispose of the evidence, I suppose, but luckily the janitor has already been around to empty the trash containers.

The fish tank is tucked away in a rather dark corner, so no one noticed anything last night. The operation wasn’t without risk; if he’d been nabbed, he’d have been obliged to call in the moving van. Perhaps somewhere deep down he doesn’t care if he gets caught, even though whenever he’s in a tight spot he’ll lie through his teeth, and rant and rave, swearing he had nothing to do with it. That’s how the game is played, he says. His philosophy: the only point of being alive is to kill time as pleasantly as possible. The trick is not to take anything too seriously. I envy him. But I’m a fast learner.

I myself was rather on edge yesterday, because Evert had told me about the attack beforehand so that I could prepare a foolproof alibi for myself. It wasn’t easy. "
B01GYPY88Y0,B01GYPY88Y,"Then they put together a pitch, which usually involves Mark and Liz too, and someone from the digital team, and sometimes Adrian. He’s not just CEO but also the co-founder of Cooper Clemmow, and he has an office downstairs. (There was another co-founder, called Max, but he retired early to the south of France.)

Adrian’s quite amazing, actually. He’s about fifty and has a shock of iron-gray wavy hair and wears a lot of denim shirts and looks like he comes from the seventies. Which I suppose, in a way, he does. He’s also properly famous. Like, there’s a display of alumni outside King’s College, London, on the Strand, and Adrian’s picture is up there.

Anyway, so that’s all the main players. But I’m not at that level, nothing like. As I said, I’m involved in the research side, which means what I’m actually doing this week is…

And, listen, before I say it, it doesn’t sound glamorous, OK? But it’s not as bad as it sounds, really.

I’m inputting data. To be specific, the results of this big customer survey we did for Coffeewite about coffee, creamers, cappuccinos, and, well, everything. Two thousand handwritten surveys, each eight pages long. I know, right? Paper? No one does paper surveys anymore. "
B01GYPY88Y1,B01GYPY88Y,"Dad doesn’t know anything about jobs, or London, or the economy, or, I don’t know, the price of a glass of wine in a London bar. I haven’t even told him exactly how much my rent is, because I know what he’d say; he’d say—

Oh God. Deep breath. Sorry. I didn’t mean to launch into some off-topic rant about my dad. Things haven’t been great between us, ever since I moved away after uni. He doesn’t understand why I moved here, and he never will. And I can try to explain it all I like, but if you can’t feel London, all you see are traffic and fumes and expense and your daughter choosing to move more than a hundred miles away.

I had a choice: Follow my heart or don’t break his. I think in the end I broke a bit of both our hearts. Which the rest of the world doesn’t understand, because they think it’s normal to move out and away from home. But they aren’t my dad and me, who lived together, just us, for all those years.

Anyway. Back to my work. People at my level don’t meet the clients—Demeter does that. And Rosa. They go out for the lunches and come back with pink cheeks and free samples and excitement. "
B01FRSZAUO0,B01FRSZAUO,"Perhaps Jakob will propose when the talk of war has subsided. Or maybe he’s waiting until he’s saved enough to afford his own place. Bella lives with her parents, too— just a few blocks west on Witolda Boulevard. Whatever the case, Nechuma has no doubt that Jakob has a plan.

At the head of the table, Sol breaks a piece of matzah gently in two. He sets one half of the matzah on a plate and wraps the other in a napkin. When the children were younger, Sol would spend weeks plotting the perfect hiding spot for the matzah, and when the time came in the ceremony to unearth the hidden afikomen, the kids would scamper like mice through the apartment in search of it. Whoever was lucky enough to find it would barter ruthlessly until inevitably walking away with a proud smile and enough zloty in his or her palm to purchase a sack of fudge krówki at Pomianowski’s candy store. Sol was a businessman and played hard— the King Negotiator, they called him—but his children knew well that deep down he was as soft as a mound of freshly churned butter, and that with enough patience and charm, they could milk him for every zloty in his pocket. "
B01FRSZAUO1,B01FRSZAUO,"Nechuma would never forget the harrowing moments before he finally cried—she was sure at the time that he wouldn’t survive the day—or how, when she held him in her arms and looked into his inky eyes, he’d stared up at her, the skin over his brow creased with a small fold, as if he were deep in thought. It was then that she understood who he was. Quiet, yes, but astute. Like his brothers and sisters born before and after him, a tiny version of the person he would grow up to be.

She watches as Jakob leans to whisper something in Bella’s ear. Bella brings a napkin to her lips, stifling a smile. On her collar, a pin catches the candlelight—a gold rose-shaped brooch with an ivory pearl at its center, a gift from Jakob. He’d given it to her a few months after they met at gymnasium. He was fifteen at the time, she fourteen. Back then, all Nechuma knew of Bella was that she took her studies seriously, that she came from a family of modest means (according to Jakob, her father, a dentist, was still settling the loans he’d taken on to pay for his daughters’ education), and that she sewed many of her own clothes, a revelation that impressed Nechuma and prompted her to wonder which of Bella’s smartest blouses were store-bought and which were handmade. "
B00ATNJW3Y0,B00ATNJW3Y,"Nothing has changed.

The two-story white house with the red door is the same. No cars in the driveway, lawn manicured to perfection. My room is dark and I wonder what they did with it. Are my pictures still lining the hallway or did those come down when I betrayed them in the worst way? What will they say when their defiant son knocks on the door and wants to stay for dinner?

I drive two blocks down and one over and stop in front of the Preston house. I’m not a fool to think she still lives here, but I know she wouldn’t miss this unless she and Katelyn are no longer friends.

The porch light flips on and the door opens. Mr. Preston, the man who was to be my father-in-law, steps out onto the porch. I know he can’t see me through my darkened helmet, but maybe he’s wondering.

He stands there and stares at me and I at him. He’s aged, just like I’m assuming my father has. He steps down onto the grass and that’s my cue to go. I hit the throttle and take off down the street, leaving Mr. Preston in his yard wondering."
B00ATNJW3Y1,B00ATNJW3Y,"Nothing is the same and everything could’ve been just like it was planned out. Mason’s not supposed to be gone. If anything, it should be me. I screwed up the plan.

I step back into the room, closing the door and pulling the curtains closed. When I look at the bed, it’s mocking me, telling me I’m uninvited. It doesn’t want me any more than I want it.

I can’t stay here. This room is going to suffocate me. I get rid of my disguise and grab my jacket and helmet. Maybe riding will clear my head, but then again, maybe not. The last time I went on an unplanned road trip I made a life-altering decision.

The red exit sign above the staircase is more inviting than the elevator. I slam my shoulder into the door and rush down the stairs, sliding down the railing just like I did when I was younger, something I haven’t done in a long time.

My helmet is on before I reach the lobby. The last thing I want is the receptionist tart getting any ideas about who I am. My luck, she’d let herself into my room, lie on the bug infested bedspread and wait for me to claim her."
B01MTJQFQY0,B01MTJQFQY,"He would unlock the gate and slide it open with his toe. His holster was empty. No gun. Standard practice everywhere in the world. No prison guard was ever armed. To carry a loaded weapon among locked-up prisoners would be just asking for trouble. He would step into the cell. He would hook his keys back on his belt and juggle the tray back into two hands. He would turn away, toward the concrete desk.

Which relative positioning would offer a number of different opportunities.

Reacher waited.

But no.

The kid was the kind of rookie who got his car stolen, but he wasn’t totally dumb. He put the tray on the floor outside the cell, just temporarily, and he took the coffee pot off it, and the cup and saucer, and he placed them all on the tile on the wrong side of the bars, and then he picked up the tray again and fed it through the slot. Reacher took it. To get a drink, he would have to put his wrists between the bars and pour on the outside. The cup would fit back through. Maybe not on its saucer, but then, he wasn’t dining at the Ritz."
B01MTJQFQY1,B01MTJQFQY,"Then eventually the young cop came back with the food. His last duty of the day, almost certainly. He was carrying a tray with a china plate with a metal cover, and a white fluted fat-bellied plastic coffee flask, and a saucer topped with an upside-down cup, and a knife and a fork wrapped in a paper napkin.

The plastic flask was the key component. It made the whole assemblage too tall to fit through the horizontal pass-through slot in the bars. The kid couldn’t lay the flask down on its side on the tray. It would roll around and the coffee would spill out all over the pie. He couldn’t pass it upright on its own through a regular part of the bars, because they were too close together for its fat-bellied shape.

The kid paused, unsure.

Twenty-four years old. A rookie. A guy who knew Reacher as nothing worse than a placid old man who spent all his time on his bed, apparently relaxed and resigned. No shouting, no yelling. No complaints. No bad temper.

Trusting the system.

No danger.

He would balance the tray one-handed on steepled fingers, like a regular waiter. He would take his keys off his belt. "
B004L62E080,B004L62E08,"Fire like fear, like panic, like one more minute of this and I’ll die if he doesn’t knock at my door, but I’d sooner he never knock than knock now. I had learned to leave my French windows ajar, and I’d lie on my bed wearing only my bathing suit, my entire body on fire. Fire like a pleading that says, Please, please, tell me I’m wrong, tell me I’ve imagined all this, because it can’t possibly be true for you as well, and if it’s true for you too, then you’re the cruelest man alive. This, the afternoon he did finally walk into my room without knocking as if summoned by my prayers and asked how come I wasn’t with the others at the beach, and all I could think of saying, though I couldn’t bring myself to say it, was, To be with you. To be with you, Oliver. With or without my bathing suit. To be with you on my bed. In your bed. Which is my bed during the other months of the year. Do with me what you want. Take me. Just ask if I want to and see the answer you’ll get, just don’t let me say no."
B004L62E081,B004L62E08,"Why won’t I believe it tomorrow morning?

So this is who he also is, I said to myself after seeing how he’d flipped from ice to sunshine.

I might as well have asked: Do I flip back and forth in just the same way?

P.S. We are not written for one instrument alone; I am not, neither are you.

I had been perfectly willing to brand him as difficult and unapproachable and have nothing more to do with him. Two words from him, and I had seen my pouting apathy change into I’ll play anything for you till you ask me to stop, till it’s time for lunch, till the skin on my fingers wears off layer after layer, because I like doing things for you, will do anything for you, just say the word, I liked you from day one, and even when you’ll return ice for my renewed offers of friendship, I’ll never forget that this conversation occurred between us and that there are easy ways to bring back summer in the snowstorm.

What I forgot to earmark in that promise was that ice and apathy have ways of instantly repealing all truces and resolutions signed in sunnier moments."
B00BSBR9N60,B00BSBR9N6,"Although she was a mathematics teacher, she had little interest in advances in the field. However, she lived nearby and would visit twice weekly and sometimes randomly. We would eat together and discuss trivia, such as events in the lives of our relatives and social interactions with our colleagues. Once a month, we drove to Shepparton for Sunday dinner with our parents and brother. She was single, probably as a result of being shy and not conventionally attractive. Due to gross and inexcusable medical incompetence, she is now dead.

The second friend was Daphne, whose friendship period also overlapped with Gene and Claudia’s. She moved into the apartment above mine after her husband entered a nursing home as a result of dementia. Due to knee failure, exacerbated by obesity, she was unable to walk more than a few steps, but she was highly intelligent and I began to visit her regularly. She had no formal qualifications, having performed a traditional female homemaker role. I considered this to be an extreme waste of talent—particularly as her descendants did not return the care. She was curious about my work, and we initiated the Teach Daphne Genetics Project, which was fascinating for both of us."
B00BSBR9N61,B00BSBR9N6,"Two lunchtimes were sufficient to research and prepare my lecture on Asperger’s syndrome, without sacrificing nourishment, thanks to the provision of Wi-Fi in the medical library café. I had no previous knowledge of autism spectrum disorders, as they were outside my specialty. The subject was fascinating. It seemed appropriate to focus on the genetic aspects of the syndrome, which might be unfamiliar to my audience. Most diseases have some basis in our DNA, though in many cases we have yet to discover it. My own work focuses on genetic predisposition to cirrhosis of the liver. Much of my working time is devoted to getting mice drunk.

Naturally, the books and research papers described the symptoms of Asperger’s syndrome, and I formed a provisional conclusion that most of these were simply variations in human brain function that had been inappropriately medicalized because they did not fit social norms—constructed social norms—that reflected the most common human configurations rather than the full range.

The lecture was scheduled for 7:00 p.m. at an inner-suburban school. I estimated the cycle ride at twelve minutes and allowed three minutes to boot my computer and connect it to the projector.

I arrived on schedule at 6:57 p.m., having let Eva, the short-skirted cleaner, into my apartment twenty-seven minutes earlier. "
B079FS38PW0,B079FS38PW,"It’s not that there’s anything wrong with them, you understand, little lamb, he’d say when I’d ask him a question after reading some new book or watching a movie in which the unsparked lived their magic-free lives. They’re just different. They’ve never understood what we are, and they never will. So it’s best we don’t mingle any more than we need to.

I wasn’t sure exactly what he’d have been worried would happen to me in town on my own at thirteen. It wasn’t as if anyone was burning suspected witches these days. But it didn’t matter now. I’d been going around Portland without any company for the last few years, once Dad’s and Celestine’s nerves had settled about my interest in keeping unsparked company. It would have been ridiculous to go back to those old rules now, when I was twenty-four.

Phil and I passed a couple of farm houses and then came into the town proper. A few cars puttered down the otherwise quiet roads. The downtown area was made up of a central cobblestone square with a large fountain in the middle and a couple streets on each side with their hodgepodge of shops.

Looking around, I realized with a twinge that I couldn’t actually say how much had changed. My visits here as a kid had been infrequent as well as escorted. My whole life had revolved around the estate."
B079FS38PW1,B079FS38PW,"She bobbed her head and hurried away.

Derek turned, the light glancing off his ash blond hair. When he saw me coming down, he smiled.

There was absolutely nothing wrong with Derek Conwyn, really. He had a softly handsome face with a high brow and light brown eyes that glimmered when a subject caught his interest. Looking at him from above as I descended the stairs, I had an excellent view of his broad shoulders and defined chest. He’d come up from Louisiana, where his family was based, so when he spoke it was with an appealing drawl. I couldn’t complain about any of that.

The only problem was I didn’t know him all that well yet. He was from a witching family, he was willing to marry into mine, he liked jazz music and sailing and dropping bad puns when a group conversation got a little tense. The rest would come now that we had more time to spend together without so much company looking on. At least, I hoped it would.

I didn’t really have a whole lot of choice. If I hadn’t taken a consort by the time I turned twenty-five, the spark of my magic would snuff out forever. "
B07B8JSRVL0,B07B8JSRVL,"I high-five her then wish them a good night. It’s almost eight o’clock and way too early for me to go to bed, but I have a good mystery book calling my name and a balcony waiting to be sat in. Sounds like a perfect night to me.

I make my way to the resort and cut through one of the pool areas. The resort has three pools, but this is the biggest one with its cascading sides, cement fish spouting water in the air, and poolside bar. The lights are dim, the water of the pool reflecting a bright teal glow, and faint music plays in the background. Everyone must be out to dinner, or down at the bars, which is so not my scene.

Closing the gate behind me, I nod at the bartender as I make my way through the pool area only to see a woman sitting at the end of the bar by herself, casually stirring a drink, legs crossed, long ebony, wavy hair lusciously falling over her shoulder.

I know that hair.

I know those slight shoulders, the smooth, freshly showered skin.

Pausing in my path to my room, I also recognize those perfects tits, small but also full. "
B07B8JSRVL1,B07B8JSRVL,"Hopefully Mr. Wilder doesn’t mind me using one of his towels or his room for that matter. He’s probably some old dude away on his golfing vacation. I hope I don’t give him a heart attack.

I drape my towel over the bed and run my hands through my naturally wavy, black hair. This will have to do. Picking up my towel one more time, I scrunch my hair, trying to soak up all the water just as the hotel door swings open, light blaring through, a tall, dark silhouette shadowed in the doorframe.

I still, frozen from the tips of my toes to the hand scrunching a towel in my hair.

Toned calves and legs are covered by black board shorts, slick to his thighs, a bulge prominent. Narrow waist where his board shorts ride low on his hips, a black shirt dancing across his broad chest, cinching sleeves cuffed over his biceps, and a V-neck providing a glimpse of how far his tan extends. Head cast down, eyes transfixed on his phone in front of him, he doesn’t notice the naked girl standing in the middle of his hotel room. He stuffs his keycard in his back pocket and looks up, startled.

I scream."
B01H9DSUAW0,B01H9DSUAW,"I’d learned that jails differ from prisons in a few key ways. They’re designed for relatively short stays while inmates await trial. So, even though this one had room for 640 occupants, it didn’t have all the amenities of a prison. There was no library, or gymnasium, or even a contact visitation room. I had to use a handset to speak to my visitors through the thick plexiglass window that separated us.

Not that I had many visitors.

Other than Casey, my only visitor had been Sergeant Dix, a Special Forces master sergeant. My CIA recruiter had enlisted Dix as part of the training program he’d designed to bring me up to par with the SOG’s other recruits, most of whom hailed from elite military units. Dix and I had grown close over the course of a very intense year, and had kept in touch the way guys tend to do, which is to say very occasionally, or whenever it was important.

I didn’t know Casey nearly as well as I knew Dix. My first battle beside him was still a couple of weeks away. But even without that familiarity, I could tell from the look in his bright eyes that the news wasn’t going to be good."
B01H9DSUAW1,B01H9DSUAW,"So rather than wasting time getting to know my fellow inmates, I was treating my time awaiting trial as though the SBCJ was a training camp.

 While Casey’s investigators were out looking for an alternative man and motive to wave before my jury, I was keeping to myself and getting into the best climbing shape of my life. 860, 861, 862.

 I was also exercising my brain in a way I’d never done before. In Moonwalking with Einstein, I’d read that a person could win the US Memory Championship by practicing an hour a day for a year. Sounded pretty cool to me — not to mention therapeutic. I’d found that I could force myself to block out virtually any amount of physical or emotional pain if focused on a compelling goal.

 While I wasn’t planning on being in jail for a whole year, I could easily dedicate an hour a day to each of the competition’s categories. After six months, I was up to 49 random words and 147 random digits. I was also getting competitive with memorizing decks of cards, my favorite.

 At the moment however, I was focused on my physical routine — and my new neighbor. NFL was about as close to Miss Manners as they came in this place. 888, 889, 890. "
B01KGZVTOE0,B01KGZVTOE,"It’s not like I’d be breaking any rules, but it’s no one else’s business, and I wouldn’t want to have to explain to Bob how I’d been working weekends and yet still hadn’t managed to make a dent in the huge pile of invoices waiting to be processed. Plus, I could do other things at home at the same time, like cook a trial menu for our first dinner together. Mummy told me, years ago, that men go absolutely crazy for sausage rolls. The way to a man’s heart, she said, is a homemade sausage roll, hot, flaky pastry, good quality meat. I haven’t cooked anything except pasta for years. I’ve never made a sausage roll. I don’t suppose it’s terribly difficult, though. It’s only pastry and mechanically recovered meat.

I switched on the machine and entered my password, but the whole screen froze. I turned the computer off and on again, and this time it didn’t even get as far as the password prompt. Annoying. I went to see Loretta, the office manager. She has overinflated ideas of her own administrative abilities, and in her spare time makes hideous jewelry, which she then sells to idiots. I told her my computer wasn’t working, and that I hadn’t been able to get hold of Danny in IT."
B01KGZVTOE1,B01KGZVTOE,"I had been drinking sour white wine, warm and tainted by the plastic glasses the pub made us drink from. What savages they must think us! Billy had insisted on buying it, to thank me for inviting him. There was no question of it being a date. The very notion was ridiculous.

The lights went down. Billy hadn’t wanted to watch the other acts, but I was adamant. You never know if you’ll be bearing witness as a new star emerges, never know who’s going to walk onto the stage and set it alight. And then he did. I stared at him. He was light and heat. He blazed. Everything he came into contact with would be changed. I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. I’d found him.

Now that fate had unfurled my future, I simply had to find out more about him; the singer, the answer. Before I tackled the horror that was the month-end accounts, I thought I’d have a quick look at a few sites—Argos, John Lewis—to see how much a computer would cost. I suppose I could have come into the office during the weekend and used one, but there was a high risk that someone else would be around and ask what I was doing. "
B01KG5GQDS0,B01KG5GQDS,"The men in the office go through what has to be done, coldly and dispassionately, as if they were talking about replacing a piece of furniture. In the old team photograph, Peter Andersson is standing in the middle; he was team captain then, GM now. It’s the perfect success story—the men in the room know the importance of building up that sort of mythology for the media as well as the fans. Next to Peter in the photograph stands Sune, the A-team coach, who persuaded Peter to move home from Canada with his family after his career as a professional player came to an end. The pair of them rebuilt the youth team with the ambition of one day having the best junior team in the country. Everyone laughed back then, but no one’s laughing now. Tomorrow those juniors are playing a semifinal game, and next year Kevin Erdahl and a few of the others will be moving up to the A-team, the sponsors will pile millions into the club, and their challenge to get back to the elite will begin in earnest. And that wouldn’t have happened without Peter, who has always been Sune’s best pupil."
B01KG5GQDS1,B01KG5GQDS,"He’s got a set of golf clubs in the car that he uses maybe twice each summer if he’s lucky. His work as GM takes up all his time: he negotiates contracts with players, talks to agents on the phone, sits in a dark video-room studying potential recruits. But this is only a small club, so when he’s done with his own work he helps the caretaker change fluorescent light bulbs and sharpen skates, reserves buses for away matches, orders equipment, and acts as a travel agent and building manager, spending as many hours maintaining the rink as he does building the team. That takes the rest of each day. Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life, it wants to be all of it.

When Peter accepted the post, he spent a whole night talking on the phone to Sune, the man who has been coach of Beartown’s A-team since Peter was a boy. It was Sune who taught Peter to skate, who offered him a place to stay when the boy’s own home was full of alcohol and bruises. He became far more of a mentor and father figure than a coach, and there have been times in Peter’s life when the old man has been the only person he felt he could really trust. "
B003JFJHTS0,B003JFJHTS,"She was the lead soprano. She was ash blond, petite, with a snub nose and huge blue eyes which she’d turn upwards during hymns. She could smile and cry at the same time, one tear or two sliding gracefully down her cheek, as if on cue, as her voice lifted through its highest notes, tremulous, effortless. It was after that she went on to other things.

The woman sitting in front of me was Serena Joy. Or had been, once. So it was worse than I thought.

I walk along the gravel path that divides the back lawn, neatly, like a hair parting. It has rained during the night; the grass to either side is damp, the air humid. Here and there are worms, evidence of the fertility of the soil, caught by the sun, half dead; flexible and pink, like lips.

I open the white picket gate and continue, past the front lawn and towards the front gate. In the driveway, one of the Guardians assigned to our household is washing the car. That must mean the Commander is in the house, in his own quarters, past the dining room and beyond, where he seems to stay most of the time."
B003JFJHTS1,B003JFJHTS,"As for my husband, she said, he’s just that. My husband. I want that to be perfectly clear. Till death do us part. It’s final.

Yes, ma’am, I said again, forgetting. They used to have dolls, for little girls, that would talk if you pulled a string at the back; I thought I was sounding like that, voice of a monotone, voice of a doll. She probably longed to slap my face. They can hit us, there’s Scriptural precedent. But not with any implement. Only with their hands.

It’s one of the things we fought for, said the Commander’s Wife, and suddenly she wasn’t looking at me, she was looking down at her knuckled, diamond-studded hands, and I knew where I’d seen her before.

The first time was on television, when I was eight or nine. It was when my mother was sleeping in, on Sunday mornings, and I would get up early and go to the television set in my mother’s study and flip through the channels, looking for cartoons. Sometimes when I couldn’t find any I would watch the Growing Souls Gospel Hour, where they would tell Bible stories for children and sing hymns. One of the women was called Serena Joy. "
B01MSMKVWD0,B01MSMKVWD,"I moved through the slender hallway toward the door at the end. There was a small kitchenette just before the bedroom, with a small table and stovetop neatly set up. I pushed open the door and found Amber slipping a dress over her uniform.

I glowered at the dress while placing the bag on the bed and unzipping it. Sighing, I began pulling the folded items out and examining them. The suit was a simple gray—a little threadbare, but serviceable. A gray-blue button-down shirt and a black tie were next, followed by a fake beard and a small box of pills labeled Deepvox.

As I set them out one by one, I felt a pang of déjà vu. The last time I had been in Patrus, Lee had given me similar items to help with his mission. Dressing like a man had afforded me more liberties around Patrus, but it had also carried a great risk. Any woman caught impersonating a male would face punishment.

Not to mention it was downright uncomfortable. The opposite sex—especially the Patrian ones—were still a giant mystery to me. Acting like one was almost impossible, so most of the time I had tried to keep my head down and my mouth shut."
B01MSMKVWD1,B01MSMKVWD,"From what I had seen of Patrian marriages, men tended to expect the woman to jump through hoops and fulfill their every demand. Or at least, that was what the Matrus government would have us believe.

The truth was, I’d only had a handful of experiences with Patrian males. Viggo was perhaps one of the more equitable males I had met. There was my cousin Cad, but I hadn’t spoken to him since he’d tried to help me smuggle my brother to safety. I wasn’t even sure if he was married, but I could imagine that he would be kinder to his wife than the other males of Patrus.

The laws of Patrus considered women no more than property, and the rules for women were in strict adherence to that. They couldn’t even be in public without a male escort—if they were, they could be arrested, or even worse. I shuddered thinking about the Porteque men who had cornered me in the alley—my first encounter with those brutes. If it hadn’t been for Viggo’s interference, they would have dragged me off.

I shook my head to clear my thoughts and shifted my gaze back to Alejandro, who was looking at me knowingly. "
B07BD1YK840,B07BD1YK84,"Or not alone in bed on a Saturday night with a woman who turned out to be a little too reserved and aloof and you needed a little fiery inspiration to get the job done.

Fiery inspiration. Fuck, that was funny.

And hot.

Grimacing, I adjusted the crotch of my pants as they threatened to grow too tight for comfort. I didn’t want to have to hide an erection from Emme when she arrived. I’d never live it down.

I closed my eyes and tried to think of something else, something not sexy. This morning’s contentious arbitration. This afternoon’s tense phone call with my mother. That ridiculous blackened rabbit. Those things distracted me for maybe five seconds, but then my mind took an unauthorized detour to Emme crawling toward me on her hands and knees, slowly this time, her eyes hooded and hungry instead of wide and panicked.

Oh, fuck.

Heat rushed my chest, making my sweater feel tight and itchy. I couldn’t breathe for a second. My stomach muscles were clenched tight as blood rushed between my legs. I imagined her looking up at me. Her hands sliding up my thighs. Her fingers unbuckling my belt. Her tongue wetting her lips. The sound of a zipper being lowered."
B07BD1YK841,B07BD1YK84,"I always teased her that she wore her heart on her sleeve and a sign on her heart that said HOMELESS—PLEASE HELP.

Not that she was needy in a clingy sort of way, because she wasn’t. There was something kind of nice about the way she needed me, actually— I think it was that she didn’t want to need me, and she would have argued until her dying breath that she didn’t need me, not really. It made it kind of fun in an antagonistic way to be the one she turned to all the time. Mostly I liked to make fun of her for it, sort of like the way you’d poke at your best friend’s younger sister.

But no matter how cute that sister was in her own hot-tempered-girl-next-door way (and probably a firecracker in bed), you couldn’t sleep with her.

Even if you sometimes thought about it.

Even if you sometimes sneaked a peek at her legs in that short black skirt. Or her ass in her tight jeans. Or that little, accidental glimpse of a bra strap when a sleeve slipped from her shoulder.

Even if you sometimes had to work really, really hard not to fantasize about her while you were in the shower. Or alone in bed on a Saturday morning. "
B01NCWWI5L0,B01NCWWI5L,"We have a seven-second delay for just this reason. Now, I believe we've got Sarah on line two. Hello Sarah…

Sarah: Hello? Am I on?

Gerry: Yes, Sarah, you're live on the air.

Sarah: I'd like to hear the new song by Adele, please.

Gerry: I'm afraid we don't do requests on this show. Now, what's your point about Skylark?

Sarah: Skylark? Oh that bunch of—

Gerry: And she has been cut off too. Again – please – watch the swearing! Let's take a song. Ah for… really? All right, by sheer coincidence, here's the new one from Adele.

Paul had received the call from a Sergeant Sinead Geraghty from Howth Garda Station at about 10 pm the night before. He had been taking Maggie for about her fifteenth walk of the day at the time. The sergeant had explained the situation to him, and then he agreed to meet her out in Howth the next morning. He didn't mention it to Phil when he got back to the car. He would have had questions. Phil always had questions. Paul hadn't known what to think, so he'd decided to try and not think about it at all until the next morning."
B01NCWWI5L1,B01NCWWI5L,"No, she didn't hate the job, she had just always felt like she was supposed to do something more with her life. She was going to have to now, she was about to get booted out on her arse.

The fire door banged open and Dr Luke Mullins stepped out. His hawkish nose, combined with the garish waistcoats he had a misjudged affection for, made him appear older than his forty-or-so years. He always looked like he was about ten pounds too heavy to comfortably fit into his suit, like he wasn't so much dressing for the job he wanted as for the body he hoped to attain. His standoffish manner made him one of the less popular doctors amongst the nursing staff, but Brigit had never minded him much. He was all business but he treated everyone the same, being just as happy to launch a rocket up another doctor's arse as he was a nurse's.

This unofficial smoking area, really just a shallow alcove between buildings, was normally the exclusive habitat of the nursing staff. They shy away from the officially sanctioned areas as the public tend to get hypocritically judgemental if they find themselves puffing away beside a medical professional."
B01N4QZ0KW0,B01N4QZ0KW,"She thought back to the time she’d researched Jackson Parrish, googling his name for hours after she read an article on the international development company he’d founded. Her breath had caught when his picture filled the screen. With thick black hair, full lips, and cobalt-blue eyes, he could have easily been on the big screen. She’d clicked on an interview in Forbes magazine that featured him and how he built his Fortune 500 company. The next link—an article in Vanity Fair—wrote about his marriage to the beautiful Daphne, ten years younger than he. Amber had gazed at the picture of their two adorable children, taken on the beach in front of a gray-and-white clapboard mansion. She’d looked up everything she could about the Parrishes, and when she read about Julie’s Smile, the foundation founded by Daphne and dedicated to raising money for cystic fibrosis, the idea came to her. The first step in the plan that developed in her mind was to move to Bishops Harbor.

When she thought back to the small-time marriage she’d tried to engineer back in Missouri, it made her want to laugh. That had ended very badly, but she wouldn’t make the same mistakes this time."
B01N4QZ0KW1,B01N4QZ0KW,"Amber had seen her at the gym in her tiny shorts and sports bra, working out like mad, but Bunny looked at her blankly, as if she’d never laid eyes on her before. Amber wanted to remind her, Oh, yes. I know you. You’re the one who brags about screwing around on your husband to your girl posse.

And then there was Meredith, who didn’t at all fit in with the rest of them. Her clothing was expensive but subdued, not like the flashy garb of the other women. She wore small gold earrings and a single strand of yellowed pearls against her brown sweater. The length of her tweed skirt was awkward, neither long nor short enough to be fashionable. As the meeting progressed, it became apparent that she was different in more ways than appearance. She sat erect in her chair, shoulders back and head held high, with an imposing bearing of wealth and breeding. And when she spoke, there was just the hint of a boarding-school accent, enough to make her words sound so much more insightful than the others’ as they discussed the silent auction and the prizes secured so far. Exotic vacations, diamond jewelry, vintage wines— the list went on and on, each item more expensive than the last."
B071NCQJ4L0,B071NCQJ4L,"She hoped to correct her mother’s impression of her life in New York City. Camilla, she had sensed, inferred pretension from the mere fact that it was not Boston.

The truth was, Gwen thought she’d better get her mother down to New York in a hurry because soon Dan’s clerkship was ending and he’d be starting at a law firm. At that point, with the increased income, there probably would be pretensions—doormen and a cleaning woman. Camilla had made sure that all through elementary and high school, Gwen studied hard. For thirteen years, she had made sure. But Gwen’s mother hadn’t known—how could she—that in Gwen’s generation, education would beget New York City would beget hired help, taxis, parking garages. Gwen would have to break her in gently.

Or so she thought.

It hadn’t worked out like that, though.

A few weeks after he started at Buckland, Brandt, Dan came home with an itchy red patch on his forearm. Gwen’s calamine lotion and baking-soda baths did nothing to soothe it. By Thanksgiving the rash had spread to his back, and by Christmas there were white spots on top of the red and they were creeping up his neck and down his legs, and Dan no longer rolled up his shirtsleeves."
B071NCQJ4L1,B071NCQJ4L,"It was one of the characteristics of New York that had made her feel most alien when they’d arrived a decade ago, when Dan took a clerkship out of law school on the Second Circuit: that this was a city of people who couldn’t be bothered to cut up their own cantaloupe or push a grocery cart down an aisle to stock up for more than a day. It was a relief when she ran out of milk and had to run down and buy a quart— when she could show it wasn’t personal.

The outer door of their building closed with a whump behind them. Kicking aside the scattering of takeout menus, Gwen dug out her keys and let the two of them through the second door. Mary went ahead, doing her posting-pony trot and clucking, while Gwen held the door for another tenant—an older man in a porkpie hat who walked with a limp. He didn’t thank Gwen but proceeded through the door with an avaricious look in his eye and lumbered quickly toward the elevator in the back. He was carrying a tabloid newspaper in a plastic bag that swung manically from the crook in his arm. "
B006WEZ9TK0,B006WEZ9TK,"My fingers reached out to touch them. They looked just as they had in my mind’s eye back in Madison when Matthew had described the Old Lodge.

Henry seemed puzzled by my reaction to an ordinary dish of fruit but was too well bred to comment. We settled ourselves at the table, and a servant added fresh bread along with a platter of grapes and a bowl of apples to the still life before us. It was comforting to see such familiar fare. Henry helped himself, and I followed his example, carefully noting which foods he selected and how much of them he consumed. It was always the little differences that gave strangers away, and I wanted to appear as ordinary as possible. While we filled our plates, Matthew poured himself a glass of wine.

Throughout our meal Henry behaved with unfailing courtesy. He never asked me anything personal, nor did he pry into Matthew’s affairs. Instead he kept us laughing with tales of his dogs, his estates, and his martinet of a mother, all the while providing a steady supply of toasted bread from the fire. He was just beginning an account of moving house in London when a clatter arose in the courtyard. "
B006WEZ9TK1,B006WEZ9TK,"Françoise, to whom propriety mattered, clucked and fussed while she finished dressing me in scavenged apparel: someone else’s petticoats; quilted stays to confine my athletic figure into a more traditionally feminine shape; an embroidered smock that smelled of lavender and cedar, with a high, ruffled neck; a black, bell-shaped skirt made of velvet; and Pierre’s best jacket, the only tailored article of clothing that was remotely my size. Try though she might, Françoise couldn’t button this last item over my breasts. I held my breath, tucked in my stomach, and hoped for a miracle as she pulled the corset’s laces tight, but nothing short of divine intervention was going to give me a sylphlike silhouette.

I asked Françoise a number of questions during the complicated process. Portraits of the period had led me to expect an unwieldy birdcage called a farthingale that would hold my skirts out at the hips, but Françoise explained that these were for more formal occasions. Instead she tied a stuffed cloth form shaped like a doughnut around my waist beneath my skirts. The only positive thing to say about it was that it held the layers of fabric away from my legs, enabling me to walk without too much difficulty—provided there was no furniture in the way and my destination could be reached if I moved in a straight line. But I would be expected to curtsy, too. "
B071RNYMNM0,B071RNYMNM,"Mattie had been Lisbeth’s nurse from the moment of her birth until Lisbeth was twelve years old. As a child Lisbeth was utterly devoted to Mattie, feeling more connected to her than to her own mother. Jordan, Mattie’s daughter, was the first baby Lisbeth had ever loved. Lisbeth had doted on her in the afternoons whenever she could get away from her lessons. When Mattie took Jordan and escaped from bondage, Lisbeth lost the two people she loved the most. Her life had been irrevocably turned upside down in an instant. That they both ended up in Oberlin, Ohio, was not entirely a coincidence, as many forward-thinking people chose to make this progressive community their home before and after the war. Their lives did not intersect often here, but Lisbeth was forever grateful for Mattie’s love and guidance, which had shaped her into the woman she had become.

Sadie had no idea that their church and her school were unusual in their mingling of the races and in the roles of women. For her it was normal to have a colored teacher and classmates of every hue. Jordan Freedman had started teaching there last fall—the same year that Sadie had begun her schooling."
B071RNYMNM1,B071RNYMNM,"After two daughters in a row they are delighted. Do not let it weigh on you that God has blessed them with five children. I’m sure his plan for you has a reason and a purpose.

Jack’s son had a fever last week. Johnny is still in bed but is expected to make a full recovery. He has missed many days of instruction, but since he is as bright as his father, I’m sure he will make them up in no time.

Your father is ill and is not expected to live into the New Year. It is only right for you to see him one last time to seek his forgiveness and help me with preparations. Let me know when to expect you.

Regards,

Mother

Stunned, Lisbeth collapsed into the chair across the table from Sadie. A swirl of emotion surged in her chest.

Over the years she had pushed down the hurt from her parents’ rejection. She had accepted that they would have a relationship only over correspondence and had not expected to ever have an in-person visit with them again.

But in her heart she longed to see them again, to make peace and perhaps cultivate true affection. Her choice had caused them harm—she knew that now with time and maturity."
B079WTRRY20,B079WTRRY2,"I’ll just drive, and you can continue to surreptitiously eye fuck me instead.’

I restrain my frustrated growl, but only just. Twisting my body in the direction of the passenger window, I find it’s not so easy in the low-slung sporty seats. Arms still folded, I resolutely ignore the cocky man sitting next to me and stare as the city passes by. People mill on sidewalks or sit at outdoor café seating, some dressed in the colours of summer, some still in office wear, but all appear to be enjoying the respite of the cool evening air. I might have only been in London a few days but many of my preconceptions have been dashed. The grey weather for one, as the sun has shone almost continually since I arrived. Truthfully, I’m finding the city heat almost oppressive.

In the absence of our sniping banter, anxiety begins to creep in. The prospect of seeing Julian again, while a little thrilling, is also a lot terrifying. What happens if he doesn’t remember our meeting the same way? What happens if he’s met someone since then? And then there’s the proximity of the man next to me, and my undoubtable attraction to him. Will. I have to remember that this is his job—that I’m his job. And his reaction to me is nothing but make-believe. "
B079WTRRY21,B079WTRRY2,"Or it could be because he towers over me. What is he—six-foot-two? Six-foot-three? Tall, anyway. Man.

And sweetheart? Love? Be still my little feminist heart—who doesn’t love to be endeared just a little bit? But, oh my Lord, this man’s voice? It’s like great sex—deep, with just a little rasp of rough, like the hint of it in his command when dealing with the mutt. Could be he’s bossy in bed, all commanding and strong. Not that I’m thinking about it. Because I’m not paying for sex, no matter what. Even if his accent does it for me. It’s so very English, with just a hint of something else sitting at the edge of certain words. Something that sounds almost Scandinavian, but what do I know?

Whatever his job description, Kallie couldn’t have chosen better. He’s my fantasy type, all right. But not the kind of man I usually date. There’s no mistaking him for a sweet beta.

What is it that makes English men so delicious? Not that I’ve been in London long enough to investigate whether this is a Sadie-centric phenomenon that appeals to all British men. Besides, they can’t all be like Mr Flirty Lips and Julian. Oh, Julian. "
B074656PYS0,B074656PYS,"I drove my blue suitcase, my Underwood Portable, and a box of books down to D.C. the next day. One of the housekeepers took me through the White House, up the stairs to Eleanor’s suite, blank and polite, as if she’d never seen me before, as if she’d never done my laundry or hemmed my skirt when I’d stayed for the weekend, but when she opened the door to my room, she smiled and put my typewriter on the desk. My new room adjoined Eleanor’s; it was her old sitting room.

I had a big desk, a bookshelf, and an old Windsor chair. I had two table lamps and a floor lamp. I had a bed, a dark velvet couch that had seen better days, which I pushed toward the corner, and an oak armoire big enough to hide in. The only thing between us was a wall covered with photographs and an old wooden door.

I spent about an hour, sitting upright on my twin bed, my hat and coat still on, staring at that door, willing it to let me in, to look down on the Rose Garden, to let me open the window to the big magnolia tree."
B074656PYS1,B074656PYS,"I hang her black coat in the closet, next to my navy-blue one, and my red scarf falls over them both. I’m sorry I’ve come.

Oh, Hick, she says, if you don’t hold me, I will die.

I climb in behind her and she undresses me with one long white hand, still not turning. I look out over her shoulder and watch people turn on their lights.

—

Eleven years ago we had our golden time and our first vacation. Maine and beyond was our golden hour. Hoover was out. Franklin was in. We all moved into the White House, friends, family, and me.

Eleanor and I had had our first private lunch at the White House, grinning and posing in front of the portraits like teenage girls. Why don’t you move in, she said. We have so much room.

I asked her what she meant and she said, again, We have so much room. I leaned over to kiss her and she pushed me away a little. I have some housekeeping to do, if you’re coming, she said. Why don’t you go and get your things?

I went back to Brooklyn and put my rent check, almost the full amount, in the mail."
B01LB4O01I0,B01LB4O01I,"Not least because Bunny not only fought dirty but he took a gleeful delight in doing so.

Paul could still remember the incident from his youth when Gary Kearney, the ex-boxer, had confronted Bunny outside Phelan’s pub. Paul had been one of a group of young fellas who’d been playing ball nearby at the time. Alan Murphy had been in Paul’s class. Kearney had recently shacked up with Alan’s ma. A few months after Kearney moved in, Alan had started falling down stairs quite a lot, only they lived in a ground floor flat. Bunny had dropped over and had a long talk with Alan’s ma about the situation, which Kearney had not appreciated. When Bunny had offered to settle it like gentlemen, Kearney couldn’t believe his luck. He’d gotten half way through taking his coat off, when Bunny pounced. Kearney never even got a punch off. When it was done, Bunny handed a roll of tightly wrapped coins he’d been holding in his hands to Alan, and told him to take the rest of the lads down to the shops for sweets. After that, Kearney moved out and Alan never fell down the stairs again. Kearney also spoke with a stammer for the rest of his life."
B01LB4O01I1,B01LB4O01I,"Admittedly, if he’d known what Brigit’s driving was like at that point, Paul would have re-evaluated that assessment. Somebody once said you know you’re getting old when the policemen start looking young, but Paul was pretty sure Garda Danaher would’ve looked young to anyone. He gave off the air of a young fella who’d borrowed his daddy’s uniform and was playing dress-up. There was a distinct aroma of Clearasil and terror about him. Paul guessed Danaher was the sort who had secretly longed his whole life to be blessed with a commanding presence, and was now gutted to find out it didn’t come with the uniform.

There’d been a brief discussion of whether or not Paul was under arrest for anything, Brigit going into a spiel about Miranda Rights. Paul was pretty sure a lot of it had been gleaned from American cop shows. Officer Danaher appeared to be more intimidated by being spoken to by a member of the public in possession of breasts than he was her in-depth legal knowledge. The poor lad hadn’t known where to look but he kept looking there anyway. Paul ended up feeling bad for him, and so he gave him his address. "
B079LF1PDH0,B079LF1PDH,"Freja—my new Swedish friend—got in touch, and I did a fair amount of sightseeing with her gang. She’s the kind of person who spends three weeks in a new city and becomes the leader of a funky group made up of expats and locals. Which means that, suddenly, I know a bunch of people in Paris I would’ve never met on my own.

Lucky me.

When I lie in bed at night, and all kinds of unwanted thoughts rush into my head, I can’t help wondering about Zach. Was his flirting with me two weeks ago some weird anomaly? Did I imagine it? Or was it real, until he reminded himself I’m his son’s nanny? Does he wonder about the connection between Noah and me?

Is there a connection?

Marguerite keeps telling me there is, but I doubt it. Even more than Noah’s feelings, I doubt mine. If I were in love with him, why would I wish he looked more like Zach, sounded more like Zach, moved more like Zach? I have no prior experience with romantic love, but I think I’d want the object of my affection to remain exactly the way he is, and not morph into his friend’s clone.

The doorbell rings."
B079LF1PDH1,B079LF1PDH,"The irony of the situation is that I have a remedy at the tip of my fingers. It’s time I used it. Tonight, as soon as I’m alone, I’ll call Sophie—quite possibly the hottest woman both sides of the Atlantic—and ask her out.

I’m building a Lego garage that will stand next to Sam’s Lego house. Sam is eager to complete the whole project by the time Zach comes home so he can prove his engineering acumen to his dad. And the reason he’s so eager is that he was unable to fix his helicopter after it finally died a few days ago. Neither could I. Or Zach.

After I finish my task and pick up my embroidery frame to practice French knots, I am reminded of the weekend in Provence.

Again.

Just the fact that I saw those coveted lavender fields was amazing, but Zach’s being there with me made the trip magical. He was so sweet. If I didn’t know better, I’d think he were courting me. More than once I caught him staring. He’d quickly look away or say something funny. The first few times I thought it had just been my wishful thinking.

But then he held me longer than was necessary to help me onto the trike. "
B00EGJ32A60,B00EGJ32A6,"If you walked along the beach, riddled through with the holes of fiddler crabs, you would sometimes look out to see one of the giant reptiles, for they, too, had adapted to their habitat.

I understood why no one lived in Area X now, that it was pristine because of that reason, but I kept un-remembering it. I had decided instead to make believe that it was simply a protected wildlife refuge, and we were hikers who happened to be scientists. This made sense on another level: We did not know what had happened here, what was still happening here, and any preformed theories would affect my analysis of the evidence as we encountered it. Besides, for my part it hardly mattered what lies I told myself because my existence back in the world had become at least as empty as Area X. With nothing left to anchor me, I needed to be here. As for the others, I don’t know what they told themselves, and I didn’t want to know, but I believe they all at least pretended to some level of curiosity. Curiosity could be a powerful distraction.

That night we talked about the tower, although the other three insisted on calling it a tunnel. The responsibility for the thrust of our investigations resided with each individual, the psychologist’s authority describing a wider circle around these decisions. "
B00EGJ32A61,B00EGJ32A6,"We had no cell or satellite phones, no computers, no camcorders, no complex measuring instruments except for those strange black boxes hanging from our belts. Our cameras required a makeshift darkroom. The absence of cell phones in particular made the real world seem very far away to the others, but I had always preferred to live without them. For weapons, we had knives, a locked container of antique handguns, and one assault rifle, this last a reluctant concession to current security standards.

It was expected simply that we would keep a record, like this one, in a journal, like this one: lightweight but nearly indestructible, with waterproof paper, a flexible black-and-white cover, and the blue horizontal lines for writing and the red line to the left to mark the margin. These journals would either return with us or be recovered by the next expedition. We had been cautioned to provide maximum context, so that anyone ignorant of Area X could understand our accounts. We had also been ordered not to share our journal entries with one another. Too much shared information could skew our observations, our superiors believed. But I knew from experience how hopeless this pursuit, this attempt to weed out bias, was. "
B01JZXZCNW0,B01JZXZCNW,"Why did I have the distinct feeling that the city of Snow Creek was paying me to do someone else’s dirty work?

I left right at five o’clock, my eyes crossing from all the numbers. One more folder to look at, but it would wait until tomorrow. A whole day’s work, and all I had learned was that the Steels were loaded. That they’d always been loaded.

I stopped at Rita’s again, got a sandwich to go, and headed down the street to my hotel. Living in a small town was great. Everything was within walking distance. I might not like it when winter came, but right now was perfect. By winter, maybe I’d have saved up enough for a car.

Up in my room, I shed my work attire, washed the makeup off my face, and got into a pair of cutoffs and a David Bowie T-shirt. I hadn’t brought the extra file home as I normally would have. I really needed a break from those numbers. I grabbed a bottle of water out of my mini fridge and sat down on the bed to eat my sandwich.

Midway through my first bite, a knock sounded on the door. "
B01JZXZCNW1,B01JZXZCNW,"The next two folders contained more bank accounts, some of which were hopelessly outdated.

My eyes were bugging out from looking at all the numbers.

I felt like I was working at cross purposes. I both did and didn’t want to find something. I certainly didn’t want to find out that the Steels were involved in anything illegal, but I did want to find anything that might help me uncover the secret that Talon was keeping and that Jonah and Ryan were helping him keep. These bank accounts did nothing to help me figure out why the marriage certificate and name certificate had been changed.

I doubted any of their money was dirty, at least not the current Steel money. I had witnessed how hard both Jonah and Ryan worked at the ranch. Talon too, when he was out at the orchards. He knew his stuff, and I couldn’t wait until the Fuji apples were ready. And the peaches… Colorado Western slope peaches… Nothing better.

More bank statements in the next folder. Had Larry only given me bank accounts?

At one o’clock, I took a quick break to walk over to Rita’s Café and have some spinach quiche, and then I got straight back to work."
B0010SKUYM0,B0010SKUYM,"After two hours of fumbling through the dark, Chronicler saw light flickering through the trees and abandoned any thought of making it to Newarre that night, deciding a farmstead’s hospitality would be welcome enough.

He left the road, blundering through the trees toward the light. But the fire was farther away than he had thought, and larger. It wasn’t lamplight from a house, or even sparks from a campfire. It was a bonfire roaring in the ruins of an old house, little more than two crumbling stone walls. Huddled into the corner those two walls made was a man. He wore a heavy hooded cloak, bundled up as if it were full winter and not a mild autumn evening.

Chronicler’s hopes rose at the sight of a small cook fire with a pot hanging over it. But as he came close, he caught a foul scent mingling with the woodsmoke. It reeked of burning hair and rotting flowers. Chronicler quickly decided that whatever the man was cooking in the iron pot, he wanted none of it. Still, even a place next to a fire was better than curling up by the side of the road.

Chronicler stepped into the circle of firelight. "
B0010SKUYM1,B0010SKUYM,"There were no customers. When evening finally came he lit the lamps and began to page disinterestedly through a book.

Fall was supposed to be the year’s busiest time, but travelers were scarce lately. Kote knew with bleak certainty how long winter would be.

He closed the inn early, something he had never done before. He didn’t bother sweeping. The floor didn’t need it. He didn’t wash the tables or the bar, none had been used. He polished a bottle or two, locked the door, and went to bed.

There was no one around to notice the difference. No one except Bast, who watched his master, and worried, and waited.

CHAPTER FOUR

Halfway to Newarre

Chronicler walked. Yesterday he had limped, but today there was no part of his feet that didn’t hurt, so limping did no good. He had searched for horses in Abbot’s Ford and Rannish, offering outrageous prices for even the most broken-down animals. But in small towns like these, people didn’t have horses to spare, especially not with harvest fast approaching.

Despite a hard day’s walking, he was still on the road when night fell, making the rutted dirt road a stumbling ground of half-seen shapes. "
B06ZYFQYYK0,B06ZYFQYYK,"He powered up the recording from the restaurant, the conversation between the men spit out at the bottom of the screen by the software package, looking like closed captioning at a sports bar. He saw that Alex was correct. The men were discussing weapons, strategy, and money. The deputy prime minister of Lesotho, Makalo Lenatha, was mentioned, then the black man spoke, and Aaron finally had a name: Lieutenant General Jonathan Mosebo, head of the Lesotho Defence Force.

The readout continued, and he learned that the general was being unceremoniously fired by the prime minister and was none too pleased about it. The other Caucasian, a man called Johan, calmed him down, and the talk continued along nebulous lines about force structures and loyalties.

Nothing to do with diamonds. What the hell?

The phone call came, the target answering, and he fast-forwarded through Alex’s short walk down the stairs. When she appeared by the target’s table, he slowed the video down again, and the scrolling sentences at the bottom turned into gibberish. Confused, he punched a couple of icons on the software package, then realized what the problem was: The man wasn’t speaking English.

He’s speaking Hebrew.

Aaron glanced up from the tablet and saw that a single streetlight had come on, providing enough feeble illumination to potentially compromise them. "
B06ZYFQYYK1,B06ZYFQYYK,"With him it was hard to tell, but if someone took it as a challenge, they’d be sorely wishing they hadn’t. Unlike a lot of the posers at the convention, he was most definitely an Operator.

While the trip was a little bit of a boondoggle, we did have a specific mission. We’d just come from a booth manned by a company called ZEV Technologies—a maker of high-end aftermarket components and custom frame/slide work for Glock pistols—and had sealed a deal to test some pistols for our specific applications.

Although we already had our own armorer support that we used to hone our combat weapons, Kurt Hale—the commander of the Taskforce—was wondering if we weren’t just reinventing the wheel and wanted to see if it would be better to simply farm out the work. After talking to ZEV, I was beginning to believe he was right, only our wheels were something from a Conestoga wagon while ZEV was racing around on run-flats.

We pushed through the crowd and entered the cavernous Venetian casino, working our way to Las Vegas Boulevard. We exited into the sunshine, leaving the commandos and gamblers, only to be hit by Guatemalan refugees trying to hand me cards with hookers offering their services. One of the strangest things about Vegas."
B078WHLR710,B078WHLR71,"my own sister—for me to rush, trip, and possibly fall. I had too many questions. First, was Gully really on his way to Mexico with Meredith? I believed he had her, but for all I knew he had her across the street. I needed to find him. If I found Gully, I’d find my sister. Second, why did he need so much money? Because Gully had a million-dollar problem. If I knew what it was, maybe I could help find a solution other than grand larceny, with me being the grand larcenist. Third, I needed to level the playing field. As it stood, Gully held all the cards.

Typically, my first move would be to gather my team. Four heads, you know.

I couldn’t, because I couldn’t tell them.

I couldn’t tell them before I told Bradley.

(Marriage, you know? I had a good one and wanted to keep it that way.)

I couldn’t go to the police. What would I say? A preacher kidnapped my sister and a witch wants me to steal a million dollars?

I couldn’t, and wouldn’t if I could, tell my parents. My father survived one heart attack. I wasn’t about to give him another.

And that left… "
B078WHLR711,B078WHLR71,"Before Bradley was president and CEO of the Bellissimo, he was an attorney. He saw things in black and white, including kidnapping and extortion. He’d have the FBI and their international counterparts here in five minutes.

I was a spy. Spies don’t call the feds until they have their man.

Or preacher.

Or witch.

Five years ago, I joined an elite internal security team at the Bellissimo. After a nice long maternity leave when Bex and Quinn were born, I’d recently returned to work, in a part-time job-share capacity with my best friend, Fantasy Erb. We reported to the head of security, Jeremy Covey, and we had a fourth on our team, Baylor. Just Baylor. He was mononymous. Like Beyoncé. And Snoopy. Before I took the Bellissimo position, I was a police officer for seven years in Pine Apple. Given my background, very different from my husband’s, I saw every shade of gray. Bradley went straight from A to Z. I meandered, often getting stuck around G, shot at near M, without a hope by T, but somehow pulled it together by Z.

I wasn’t sure what I was dealing with, and I wasn’t going to drag Bradley into it until I was. Too much was at stake— "
B07BLJYCY30,B07BLJYCY3,"She cuts it off so she won’t start crying.

She stirs a little then, the pang of pain in her head not so bad as it was last time. Moving her feet, it occurs to her how cold they are.

Tiles the color of brick etch a grid into the floor. The little gray seams of grout dividing everything up into boxes. Into cells.

Appropriate, she thinks. This is her cell.

Again she rattles her cuffs against the bar. Makes the desk hop up and down a little, metal feet scratching at the tile with angry squawks.

But her headache flares back into blinding territory, and she gives it up.

Rest. For now, she will rest.

She will save her strength for the fight ahead.

Emily thinks of Gabby as she drifts, her thoughts half-conscious and half-dream. Somewhere in between and both at once.

Images of her friend flicker in her head. Silent movies. Slices of life where little happens.

Coils of dark hair bunch at each side of Gabby’s face. The cigarette perpetually dangles from her lip. She smiles. She smokes. She looks bored. The background shifts and morphs along with her expressions — rooms and cityscapes taking shape behind her in pulses."
B07BLJYCY31,B07BLJYCY3,"Probably in the middle of nowhere. Somewhere up in the mountains, away from the city.

Thick bands of what looks like stucco surround the dark planks of wood that comprise the structure, striping the wall in light and dark. The messy edges where the white touches the lumber looks like foamy toothpaste in the half-light.

It’s dark. Is it still night? She’s not sure.

Gray shadows fall over the floors, climb up the walls, collect into clouds of black in every corner.

A single burning bulb in a track lighting fixture provides what little light there is, all of it angled away from her. A circle glowing on the far wall.

Boards block out every window. Heavy wood. Nailed or screwed in tightly. She couldn’t remove it without tools and time.

That leaves the heavy steel door off to her right as the only way out. A blue-gray thing that offers little hope of escape. The metal looks out of place among all the wood. Probably added by him. The finishing touch to complete his dream torture chamber. Really ties the room together.

A silent laugh emits from her nostrils, more injured than joyous. The sardonic thought is too scary to be funny. "
B00G3L6KQI0,B00G3L6KQI,"Matthew knocked and pushed at the heavy slab of wood without waiting for a response. With the exception of the shiny silver laptop on the desk where the blotter used to be, the room looked exactly as it had on the day Philippe de Clermont died in 1945. The same Bakelite telephone was on a table by the window. Stacks of thin envelopes and curling, yellowed paper stood at the ready for Philippe to write to one of his many correspondents. Tacked to the wall was an old map of Europe, which Philippe had used to track the positions of Hitler’s army.

Matthew closed his eyes against the sudden, sharp pain. What Philippe had not foreseen was that he would fall into the Nazis’ hands. One of the unexpected gifts of their timewalk had been the chance to see Philippe again and be reconciled with him. The price Matthew had to pay was the renewed sense of loss as he once more faced a world without Philippe de Clermont in it.

When Matthew’s eyes opened again, he was confronted with the furious face of Phoebe Taylor. It took only a fraction of a second for Marcus to angle his body between Matthew and the warmblooded woman. "
B00G3L6KQI1,B00G3L6KQI,"From his former seat on the Congregation, he had managed to save a few witches from hanging. Diana had begun the lifelong process of growing into her powers as a witch. They’d even taken in two orphaned children and given them a chance at a better future. Their life in the sixteenth century had not always been easy, but their days had been filled with love and the sense of hope that followed Diana wherever she went. Here at Sept-Tours, they seemed surrounded on all sides by death and de Clermonts.

The combination made Matthew restless, and the anger he kept so carefully in check whenever Diana was near him was dangerously close to the surface. Blood rage—the sickness that Matthew had inherited from Ysabeau when she’d made him—could take over a vampire’s mind and body quickly, leaving no room for reason or control. In an effort to keep the blood rage in check, Matthew had reluctantly agreed to leave Diana in Ysabeau’s care while he walked around the castle grounds with his dogs, Fallon and Hector, trying to clear his head.

Gallowglass was crooning a sea chantey in the château’s great hall. For reasons Matthew couldn’t fathom, every other verse was punctuated by expletives and ultimatums. "
B01BD1SUBU0,B01BD1SUBU,"How would it look if she pulled away? She can smell that he’s been drinking.

Anne now blames herself. It’s her fault. She wants to blame Marco, but she agreed to leave the baby alone. She should have stayed home. No—she should have brought Cora with them next door, to hell with Cynthia. She doubts Cynthia would have actually thrown them out and had no party for Graham at all. This realization comes too late.

They will be judged, by the police and by everybody else. Serves them right, leaving their baby alone. She would think that, too, if it had happened to someone else. She knows how judgmental mothers are, how good it feels to sit in judgment of someone else. She thinks of her own mothers’ group, meeting with their babies once a week in one another’s homes for coffee and gossip, what they will say about her.

Someone else has arrived—a composed man in a well-cut dark suit. The uniformed officers treat him with deference. Anne looks up, meets his piercing blue eyes, and wonders who he is.

He approaches and sits down in one of the armchairs across from Anne and Marco and introduces himself as Detective Rasbach. Then he leans forward. "
B01BD1SUBU1,B01BD1SUBU,"Someone has placed a blanket around her shoulders, but she’s still trembling. She is in shock. Police cars are parked on the street outside the house, their red lights flashing, pulsing through the front window and circling the pale walls. Anne sits immobile on the sofa and stares ahead as if hypnotized by them.

Marco, his voice breaking, has given the police a quick description of the baby— six months old, blond, blue eyes, about sixteen pounds, wearing a disposable diaper and a plain, pale pink onesie. A light summer baby blanket, solid white, is also missing from the crib.

The house is swarming with uniformed police officers. They fan out and methodically begin to search the house. Some of them wear latex gloves and carry evidence kits. Anne and Marco’s fast, frantic race through the house in the short minutes before the police arrived had turned up nothing. The forensic team is moving slowly. Clearly they are not looking for Cora; they are looking for evidence. The baby is already gone.

Marco sits down on the sofa next to Anne and puts his arm around her, holds her close. She wants to pull away, but she doesn’t. She lets his arm stay there. "
B0024CEY360,B0024CEY36,"On the second floor, the family bedrooms were mostly on the south side, the main guest rooms on the west side and the servants’ rooms over the kitchens to the northeast, out of sight. Above the second floor was an irrational collection of towers, turrets and attics. The whole facade was a riot of ornamental stonework in the best Victorian rococo manner, with flowers and chevrons and sculpted coils of rope, dragons and lions and cherubim, balconies and battlements, flagpoles and sundials and gargoyles. Lydia loved the place, and she was grateful that Stephen—unlike many of the old aristocracy—could afford to keep it up.

She saw Charlotte and Belinda emerge from the shrubbery across the lawn. Annie had not found them, of course. They both wore wide-brimmed hats and summer frocks with schoolgirls’ black stockings and low black shoes. Because Charlotte was coming out this season, she was occasionally permitted to put up her hair and dress for dinner, but most of the time Lydia treated her like the child she was, for it was bad for children to grow up too fast. The two cousins were deep in conversation, and Lydia wondered idly what they were talking about. What was on my mind when I was eighteen? "
B0024CEY361,B0024CEY36,"She strolled across the lawn, thinking of familiar and pleasant things, pushing St. Petersburg to the back of her mind. Stephen’s father, the seventh Earl of Walden, had planted the west side of the park with rhododendrons and azaleas. Lydia had never met the old man, for he had died before she knew Stephen, but by all accounts he had been one of the great larger-than-life Victorians. His bushes were now in full glorious bloom and made a rather un-Victorian blaze of assorted colors. We must have somebody paint a picture of the house, she thought; the last one was done before the park was mature.

She looked back at Walden Hall. The gray stone of the south front looked beautiful and dignified in the afternoon sunshine. In the center was the south door. The farther, east wing contained the drawing room and various dining rooms, and behind them a straggle of kitchens, pantries and laundries running higgledy-piggledy to the distant stables. Nearer to her, on the west side, were the morning room, the Octagon, and at the corner the library; then, around the corner along the west front, the billiard room, the gun room, her flower room, a smoking room and the estate office. "
B01N6IHCSA0,B01N6IHCSA,"His wife, Lianne, had never been able to accustom herself to such violent love, though at the beginning, having come from a family that suppressed even its sneezes, she had been attracted to its heat. Early on in their courtship, Epstein had told her that from his father’s brutality and tenderness he’d learned that a person can’t be reduced, a lesson that had guided him all his life, and for a long time Lianne thought of this—of Epstein’s own complexity, his resistance to easy categorization—as something to love. But in the end it had exhausted her just as it had exhausted so many others, though never his parents, who remained his tireless sparring partners, and who, Epstein sometimes felt, had lived on with such tenacity only to torment him. He’d taken care of them until the end, which they’d lived out in a penthouse he bought for them in Miami, with deep-pile carpets that came up to their ankles. But he had never found peace with them, and only after their deaths— his mother following his father within three months—and after he’d given nearly everything away did Epstein feel the sharp stab of regret. The naked bulb sputtered on and off behind his inflamed lids when he tried to sleep. He couldn’t sleep. Had he accidentally given sleep away, along with everything else?"
B01N6IHCSA1,B01N6IHCSA,"Looking in at the strangely vague Epstein in the dark interior, he wondered briefly whether there was something more grave going on with his longtime client—a kind of neurological turbulence, perhaps, that might develop toward the extreme before it was diagnosed as medical. At the time, Schloss had brushed the thought off, but later it came back to him as prescient.

And indeed at last, after nearly a year of chipping away at the accumulations of a lifetime, Epstein arrived at the bottommost layer. There, he hit on the memory of his parents, who had washed up on the shores of Palestine after the war and conceived him under a burned-out bulb that they had not had enough money to replace. At the age of sixty-eight, having cleared a space to think, he found himself consumed by that darkness, deeply moved by it. His parents had brought him, their only son, to America, and once they’d learned English, resumed the screaming match that they’d begun in other languages. Later his sister Joanie came along, but she, a dreamy, unresponsive child, refused to take the bait, and so the battle remained triangulated. His parents screamed at each other, and they screamed at him, and he screamed back at them, together and separately. "
B000FCKEF40,B000FCKEF4,"With a sigh, she bundled them close together, piling up the straw around them, and covered them with her cloak. It was growing colder, but winter had gone; there was no feel of frost in the air.

The party was still going on, but it had shifted to a lower gear. The dancing had stopped and the crowd broken up into smaller groups, men gathered in a circle near the fire, lighting their pipes, the younger men disappeared somewhere. All around her, families were settling in for the night, making nests for themselves in the hay. Some were in the house, more in the barn; she could hear the sound of a guitar from somewhere behind the house, and a single voice, singing something slow and wistful. It made her yearn suddenly for the sound of Roger’s voice as it had been, rich and tender.

Thinking of that, though, she realized something; his voice had been much better when he came back from consoling Ronnie. Still husky and with only a shadow of its former resonance—but it had come easily, without that choked note in it. Perhaps alcohol relaxed the vocal cords?

More likely, she thought, it simply relaxed Roger; removed some of his inhibitions about the way he sounded. That was worth knowing. "
B000FCKEF41,B000FCKEF4,"She went reluctantly, but Brianna saw that by the time they had reached the dance, Lizzie was laughing at something Manfred had said, and he was smiling down at her, the firelight glowing on the handsome planes of his face. They were a nice-looking couple, she thought, better-matched in appearance than Senga and her Heinrich—who was tall, but spindly and rather hatchet-faced.

Inga and Hilda had begun arguing with each other in German, allowing Brianna to devote herself to the wholehearted consumption of the excellent supper. Hungry as she was, she would have enjoyed almost anything, but the tart, crisp sauerkraut and the sausages, bursting with juice and spices, were a rare treat.

It was only as she wiped the last of the juice and grease from her wooden plate with a chunk of corn bread that she cast a glance at the cooper’s shop, thinking guiltily that she ought perhaps to have saved some for Roger. He was so kind, taking thought for poor Ronnie’s feelings. She felt a rush of pride and affection for him. Maybe she should go over there and rescue him.

She had put down her plate and was sorting out her skirts and petticoats, in preparation for putting this plan into action, when she was forestalled by a pair of small figures who came weaving out of the darkness."
B01LY7FD0D0,B01LY7FD0D,"CHAPTER 3

The museum atrium felt like a futuristic cathedral.

As Langdon stepped inside, his gaze shifted immediately skyward, climbing a set of colossal white pillars along a towering curtain of glass, ascending two hundred feet to a vaulted ceiling, where halogen spotlights blazed pure white light. Suspended in the air, a network of catwalks and balconies traversed the heavens, dotted with black-and-white-clad visitors who moved in and out of the upper galleries and stood at high windows, admiring the lagoon below. Nearby, a glass elevator slid silently back down the wall, returning to earth to collect more guests.

It was like no museum Langdon had ever seen. Even the acoustics felt foreign. Instead of the traditional reverent hush created by sound-dampening finishes, this place was alive with murmuring echoes of voices percolating off the stone and glass. For Langdon, the only familiar sensation was the sterile tang on the back of his tongue; museum air was the same worldwide—filtered meticulously of all particulates and oxidants and then moistened with ionized water to 45 percent humidity.

Langdon moved through a series of surprisingly tight security points, noticing more than a few armed guards, and finally found himself standing at another check-in table. "
B01LY7FD0D1,B01LY7FD0D,"Several days ago, the Regent had shared with him a secret so disturbing that Ávila had seen no choice but to offer himself fully to the cause. The brutality of last night’s mission still haunted him, and yet he knew his actions would be forgiven.

Righteousness exists in many forms.

And more death will come before tonight is over.

As Ávila emerged into an open plaza on the riverbank, he raised his eyes to the massive structure before him. It was an undulating mess of perverse forms covered in metal tile—as if two thousand years of architectural progress had been tossed out the window in favor of total chaos.

Some call this a museum. I call it a monstrosity.

Focusing his thoughts, Ávila crossed the plaza, winding his way through a series of bizarre sculptures outside Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum. As he neared the building, he watched dozens of guests mingling in their finest black and white.

The godless masses have congregated.

But tonight will not go as any of them imagine.

He straightened his admiral’s cap and smoothed his jacket, mentally fortifying himself for the task that lay ahead. Tonight was part of a far greater mission—a crusade of righteousness.

As Ávila crossed the courtyard toward the museum’s entrance, he gently touched the rosary in his pocket."
B01DCAV4W20,B01DCAV4W2,"The creation of the Forge of Heavens had attracted many more villagers and they were all walking through it amazed. Even the dwarves were walking around with expressions of quiet glee, and sometimes they weren’t even that quiet. Richter didn’t know how long the detente between the territorial smiths and the other villagers would last, but he planned to take advantage of the peace and silence as long as he could.

Crafting, Smithing or Enchanting, he asked himself. When he had planted the Seed Core, he hadn’t been given an option. His Herb Lore skill had just skyrocketed. He hadn’t been able to make too much use of that yet, but he was sure it would come in handy in the future. So now Richter had a decision to make. With his Limitless ability, it wasn’t really a question of which skill he should learn. Given enough time, he should theoretically be able to learn everything. The real question was, what would give him the best bonus right now? It would be great to make his own weapons. He could just see himself wielding his own katana, fighting off ninjas and then moving his mouth dramatically to form Japanese words while waiting for English words to come out on a delay. Shogun Assassin style!"
B01DCAV4W21,B01DCAV4W2,"You have crafted a Legendary Object: The Forge of Heavens. You have learned two new skills.

Congratulations! You have learned the skill: Crafting. It is not only weapons and armor that will serve you well in The Land. Rings, belts, bracelets and other items have their own value. If enchanted, these items can easily be the difference between life and death. You now have the ability to take base components and create something greater than the sum of its parts. +1% Durability, Value, and Success Rate of Crafted Items.

Congratulations! You have learned the skill: Smithing. You may now take raw materials and unlock their potential to help or harm. It may be shining silver or gleaming gold that capture a woman’s eye, but it is sharp steel and mighty mithril that can cut out a man’s heart! +1% Durability, Attack or Defense of Forged Items

In light of this amazing achievement, you may choose to drastically increase your skill level in either of your two new skills or your existing skill of enchanting. Which do you choose? Smithing skill, Enchanting skill or Crafting skill?

Richter blinked and minimized the prompts. He took in his surroundings. Everyone around him was walking around entranced by their surroundings. "
B079WJL86J0,B079WJL86J,"It was a bad combination of acting out due to anger along with being the new, hot guy on campus at the local college I’d transferred to.

Over time, though, I began to accept things as they were. After all, even if Amber had been available, I knew I wasn’t the right guy for her anyway. She deserved someone who wouldn’t screw her over, someone like…Rory. He was safe. I grew to accept them together, and she and I were able to renew our friendship, although things were never exactly the same again between the three of us—especially between Rory and me. And he knew why.

Had seeing them together still hurt like a motherfucker? Yes. But I’d accepted that he was the better man for her. Sucking up my jealousy and pride, I ended up moving on.

So, finding out that he’d broken her heart all these years later was a tough pill to swallow. If he were in front of me right now, there was no guarantee I wouldn’t injure him.

I flipped my pillow around and fluffed it while Kitty purred and curled up into the crook of my neck. A sneeze from behind the bedroom door was the first indication that Amber, too, wasn’t getting any sleep.

I got up. "
B079WJL86J1,B079WJL86J,"So, when Rory came to me and confessed his feelings for Amber one night, I felt like I needed to tell him how I really felt about her, too. My jealousy was through the roof, even though I didn’t think he was any kind of competition for me. That had been the one consolation—or so I thought. We agreed that since we couldn’t both have her, that neither of us would tell her how we felt. We’d come to the understanding that it was better to keep our friendship intact—both with each other and with Amber.

I therefore didn’t feel like I needed to watch my back when I went away to the University of Florida, leaving my friends behind. I trusted that he wouldn’t move in on her and even more so, I figured that if he did, she wouldn’t return his feelings. It was like double security in my mind.

Homesick, I decided to transfer back to a state school after my first year in Gainesville was up. When I came home that summer and found out that they were together, it felt like the ultimate betrayal. I alienated myself from both of them for a while. During that time, my manwhore ways were worse than ever once the school year started up again. "
B000JMKV9Y0,B000JMKV9Y,"His black eyes, so much like a large bird’s, flitted about the paper as he shifted from one foot to the other in sudden, quick movements. He held the Times in his right hand, and his left arm, underdeveloped as the result of a childhood injury, was pulled in close to his body. The left hand occasionally rose to swipe at his neatly trimmed mustache and the small patch of beard under his lower lip. His dark hair, cut far too long to meet the fashion of the day, and swept back on his head, was moist, for he always went hatless; and this, along with the bobbing of his face at the pages before him, only increased the impression of some hungry, restless hawk determined to wring satisfaction from the worrisome world around him.

Standing next to Kreizler was the enormous Cyrus Montrose, Laszlo’s valet, occasional driver, effective bodyguard, and alter ego. Like most of Kreizler’s employees, Cyrus was a former patient, one who made me more than a little nervous, despite his apparently controlled manner and appearance. That morning he was dressed in gray pants and a tightly buttoned brown jacket, and his broad, black features did not seem even to register my approach. "
B000JMKV9Y1,B000JMKV9Y,"O’Neill’s, Adams & Company, Simpson-Crawford—before I rapped on the roof of the cab with my first and assured my man that I did need to get to Bellevue this morning. With a rude jerk we spun right at Twenty-third, and then plowed through the thoroughly unregulated intersection of that street with Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Passing the squat bulk of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where Boss Platt made his headquarters and was probably putting the finishing touches to the Greater New York scheme at that very moment, we turned up along the eastern edge of Madison Square Park to Twenty-sixth, then changed directions in front of the Italianate arcades and towers of Madison Square Garden to head east once more. The square, solemn, red-brick buildings of Bellevue appeared on the horizon, and in just a few more minutes we crossed First Avenue and pulled up behind a large black ambulance on the Twenty-sixth Street side of the hospital grounds, near the entrance to the Insane Pavilion. I paid my cabbie off and headed in.

The Pavilion was a simple building, long and rectangular. A small, uninviting vestibule greeted visitors and internees, and beyond this, through the first of many iron doors, was a wide corridor running down the center of the building. "
B01HB9Q7CW0,B01HB9Q7CW,"The maid ushers me to a sitting room that, though still grand, shows signs of wear. The rugs are a bit frayed and there are some spaces in the silver cabinet that are empty, as though the bigger pieces had been taken or sold. Stale cigar smoke mixes with the scent of lemon polish. I peer out the window, straining to see my family’s estate through the fog that has settled above the valley. I wonder who lives in our villa now and what they see when they look down at the barren deserted winter quarters.

After our wedding, a small ceremony with a justice of the peace, I moved into Erich’s spacious apartment overlooking the Tiergarten . I spent my days strolling the shops along Bergmannstrasse, buying richly colored paintings and rugs and embroidered satin pillows, little things that would make his once-sparse quarters our home. Our biggest dilemma was which café to frequent for Sunday brunch.

I’d been in Berlin for almost five years when the war broke out. Erich received a promotion to something I didn’t understand having to do with munitions and his days became longer. He would come home either dark and moody, or heady with excitement about things he could not share with me. "
B01HB9Q7CW1,B01HB9Q7CW,"I was not some young girl, easily wooed, but nearly twenty-nine. Busy with the circus and constantly on the road, I had assumed that marriage had passed me by. Erich was impossibly handsome, though, with a strong jaw marred only by a cleft chin, and square features softened by the bluest of eyes. He came a second night and pink roses appeared before my dressing room door. We courted that spring, and he made the long trip down from Berlin every weekend to the cities where we performed to spend time with me between shows and on Sundays.

We should have known even then that our relationship was doomed. Though Hitler had just come to power a year earlier, the Reich had already made clear its hatred for the Jews. But there was passion and intensity in Erich’s eyes that made everything around us cease to exist. When he proposed, I didn’t think twice. We did not see the problems that loomed large, making our future together impossible—we simply looked the other way.

My father had not fought me on leaving with Erich. I expected him to rebuke me for marrying a non-Jew, but he only smiled sadly when I told him. "
B01K3WN2LS0,B01K3WN2LS,"His right eye was an empty crater because the bullet he’d fired into his chin had burst from there after catapulting through parts of the brain. His facial skin was deathly gray, where it wasn’t swollen and stained purple by burst capillaries. His breathing was erratic and the monitor showed his vitals to be fluctuating all over the place. He was in the critical care unit, the place designated for the sickest and most badly injured patients at the hospital.

But he wasn’t just injured; Walter Dabney was dying.

The doctors who had been in and out during the day had all confirmed that it was simply a matter of time before the brain told the heart to stop pumping. And there was nothing they could do about it. The damage was such that no medicine and no surgery could bring the man back. They were just counting down the time until death.

Mrs. Eleanor Dabney, better known as Ellie, had arrived thirty minutes after the FBI had told her what had happened. They would have to question her, but right now the woman was simply a grieving widow-to-be. She was currently in the bathroom throwing up, a nurse assisting her.

Bogart eyed Jamison. "
B01K3WN2LS1,B01K3WN2LS,"Decker rose, showed her his ID, and said he was with an FBI task force. And also that he had witnessed the murder.

Decker glanced over as Todd Milligan, the fourth member of the joint task force, entered the room. A fifth member, Lisa Davenport, a psychologist by training, had not returned to the group, opting instead to go back to private practice in Chicago.

Milligan was in his midthirties, six feet tall, with close-cropped hair and a physique that appeared chiseled out of granite. He and Decker had initially butted heads, but now the two men got along as well as Decker could with anyone.

Decker had trouble relating to people. That had not always been the case, because he was not the same person he had once been.

In addition to the synesthesia, Decker also had hyperthymesia, or perfect recall, after suffering a brain trauma on the same vicious hit in his very short career in the NFL. It had altered his personality, changing him from gregarious and fun-loving to aloof and lacking the ability to recognize social cues— a skill most people took for granted. People first meeting him would assume he was somewhere on the autism spectrum."
B0711QCV3C0,B0711QCV3C,"Bobby drove us to the ferry station, where people could grab a boat to Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard, Provincetown, Portland or, in my case, Scupper Island, my hometown, a small island three miles off the rough and ragged coast of southern Maine. The Scupper Island ferry came to Boston almost every day; it was also the mail boat and could carry all of three cars.

Bobby unloaded my suitcases and bought my ticket. Our breakup had made him once again solicitous; he’d been a prince these past few days, fetching me my painkillers, reading to me as I fell asleep, even cooking for me.

I didn’t care. He’d been fondling someone’s hair in my hospital room, and that was not something I’d forget.

The ferry pulled in, a battered little thing, same as it had always been. Jake Ferriman, the eponymous captain of the boat, was a fixture. He didn’t acknowledge me, just tied up the boat and jumped off, a small sack of mail in one hand.

I’d hoped my mom would come on the ferry to get me; I’d called her when I was discharged from the hospital and told her I’d be coming home, that I’d been hurt but was okay— I think I used the words expected to recover, always looking for attention where my mother was concerned. "
B0711QCV3C1,B0711QCV3C,"It had always been a long shot, I knew that, but I’d imagined stalking him after he did a show on Broadway, waiting by the side door, our eyes meeting, his inimitable smile, going out for a drink, sharing our favorite moments from Harry Potter, me finding out that he, too, hated the destruction of Hogwarts and agreed that Ron was nowhere near worthy of Hermione. Now, with me dead, it definitely wasn’t gonna happen.

True, no one was acting like I was dead, but I was fairly certain I was. Maybe they just hadn’t noticed yet. I guessed this ER wasn’t quite the be-all and end-all of modern medicine, was it? I thought I’d heard the words dislocated patella and ortho consult and trauma alert. I was pretty sure I’d seen the tunnel of light, but my spirit was tuning in and out.

What was that beeping? It was really hurting my head.

I’d read about this kind of thing happening. Out-of-body experiences. The soul lingering a little while before heading for the afterlife. Did I know anyone who’d greet me from heaven? My dad, maybe, if he was dead? That mean-ass grandmother of mine who used to tell me I was fat? I hoped she wasn’t there. Who else? Maybe that sweet patient who’d died of pancreatic cancer during my fellowship. God, I had loved her. "

And she’s got this kid with her, he can’t be no more than seventeen, with hair down to his asshole and his crotch bulgin like he stuffed it up with the funnypages. So they’re here a week, ten days maybe, and every night it’s the same drill. Down in the Colorado Lounge from five to seven, her suckin up Singapore slings like they’re gonna outlaw em tomorrow and him with just the one bottle of Olympia, suckin it, makin it last. And she’d be makin jokes and sayin all these witty things, and every time she said one he’d grin just like a fuckin ape, like she had strings tied to the corners of his mouth. Only after a few days you could see it was gettin harder an harder for him to grin, and God knows what he had to think about to get his pump primed by bedtime. Well, they’d go in for dinner, him walkin and her staggerin, drunk as a coot, you know, and he’d be pinchin the waitresses and grinnin at em when she wasn’t lookin. Hell, we even had bets on how long he’d last. "
B001BANK321,B001BANK32,"Yeah, that guy Grady. He was a bad actor, I knew that the minute I saw him. Always grinnin like an egg-suck dog. That was when they were just startin out here and that fat fuck Ullman, he woulda hired the Boston Strangler if he’d’ve worked for minimum wage. Was a ranger from the National Park that found em; the phone was out. All of em up in the west wing on the third floor, froze solid. Too bad about the little girls. Eight and six, they was. Cute as cut-buttons. Oh, that was a hell of a mess. That Ullman, he manages some honky-tonky resort place down in Florida in the off-season, and he caught a plane up to Denver and hired a sleigh to take him up here from Sidewinder because the roads were closed—a sleigh, can you believe that? He about split a gut tryin to keep it out of the papers. Did pretty well, I got to give him that. There was an item in the Denver Post, and of course the bituary in that pissant little rag they have down in Estes Park, but that was just about all. Pretty good, considerin the reputation this place has got. "
B0054LJGWS0,B0054LJGWS,"The text will be slowed down to allow the sleight of hand to be followed.

Mrs. Deirdre Young is giving birth in Delivery Room Three. She is having a golden-haired male baby we will call Baby A.

The wife of the American Cultural Attaché, Mrs. Harriet Dowling, is giving birth in Delivery Room Four. She is having a golden-haired male baby we will call Baby B.

Sister Mary Loquacious has been a devout Satanist since birth. She went to Sabbat School as a child and won black stars for handwriting and liver. When she was told to join the Chattering Order she went obediently, having a natural talent in that direction and, in any case, knowing that she would be among friends. She would be quite bright, if she was ever put in a position to find out, but long ago found that being a scatterbrain, as she’d put it, gave you an easier journey through life. Currently she is being handed a golden-haired male baby we will call the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness.

Watch carefully. Round and round they go…."
B0054LJGWS1,B0054LJGWS,"When you thought about it, Mr. Young mused, they probably saw no reason why the father should be involved anywhere.

He finished thumbing the so-called tobacco into the pipe and glared at the little sign on the wall of the waiting room that said that, for his own comfort, he would not smoke. For his own comfort, he decided, he’d go and stand in the porch. If there was a discreet shrubbery for his own comfort out there, so much the better.

He wandered down the empty corridors and found a doorway that led out onto a rain-swept courtyard full of righteous dustbins.

He shivered, and cupped his hands to light his pipe.

It happened to them at a certain age, wives. Twenty-five blameless years, then suddenly they were going off and doing these robotic exercises in pink socks with the feet cut out and they started blaming you for never having had to work for a living. It was hormones, or something.

A large black car skidded to a halt by the dustbins. A young man in dark glasses leaped out into the drizzle holding what looked like a carrycot and snaked toward the entrance.

Mr. Young took his pipe out of his mouth."
B075ZVWM570,B075ZVWM57,"I decided to wait to continue until we were alone.

The charge nurse bustled into the room and apologized for the cramped conditions. We would be able to use her office if the patient’s bed would fit. An orderly rolled the bed down the hallway, and Koivu and I followed. Once we moved the chairs out of the way, the bed fit in between the desk and the doorway with just enough space to get the door closed.

Lady X’s face bore a withdrawn expression. I introduced myself and Koivu, and then asked her her name. She gave no reply. The who, why, and where questions yielded similar results. I began to doubt whether this young woman understood Russian after all. Maybe she was from Poland or Slovenia. I tried Finnish, Swedish, English, and German without any luck. Her brown eyes stared at the blanket, and her attractively shaped lips remained closed. After fifteen minutes of trying to get her to say something, I asked Koivu to leave the room. Maybe she was afraid of men. But one-on-one didn’t help either. Frustrated, I went to talk to the doctor.

I found the attending physician scribbling on a chart just down the hallway."
B075ZVWM571,B075ZVWM57,"I also didn’t let on that I’d chosen Russian back in high school because my first love, Johnny, had studied it too. How funny that a moment of schoolgirl fancy might help with a criminal investigation nearly twenty-five years later.

Koivu drove while I tried to remember relevant vocabulary and phrases. I’d practiced Russian with the assistant coach of Iida’s figure-skating group, but terms for jumps and spins probably wouldn’t be much use in an assault interview.

The last time I’d visited Jorvi Hospital was in the fall, when we’d said good-bye to Antti’s father. That memory still brought a lump to my throat, even though Tauno Sarkela’s passing after a long illness had been a relief. To me, Jorvi meant pain and death—both of my children had been born at a birthing center away from the big city in Tammisaari.

Koivu walked briskly from the parking lot, as if he wanted to get this job over with as quickly as possible. I suddenly felt as though I couldn’t remember a single word of Russian.

The desk nurse directed us to the correct room. Our victim lay in a bed near the window. In the middle bed slept an elderly lady, and nearer the door was a woman about my age with curly hair, her leg elevated in a cast."
B01A4AXM3W0,B01A4AXM3W,"It would trade only on Carter’s name, which had been recently sullied by the rift with Byrne.

And yet, because his new firm was so small, Carter was able to offer Paul something that Byrne could not: partnership. To be sure, the split Carter suggested was far from generous—60/24/16, with Paul in the minority share. And yet…at no other firm in the world would Paul have his name on the door.

Did Paul want to be Byrne’s clerk? Or Carter’s partner?

The firm of Carter, Hughes & Cravath opened its doors on January 1, 1888.

—

Of paramount importance in those early days was the matter of attracting clients. Carter mined his decades of business connections. Hughes had been helpfully engaged in some minor but long-standing litigation for the Rome, Watertown, and Ogdensburg Railroad. But Paul had nothing more to work with than a handful of school chums and a decent sales pitch. By the close of the sixth week, having failed to bring in a single dollar to the practice, Paul felt his confidence give way to disappointment. Every hour that he spent alone at that desk, in the quiet of his uselessness, revealed him to be a fraud."
B01A4AXM3W1,B01A4AXM3W,"A YEAR EARLIER, PAUL had been an eager young prodigy with one of the most coveted positions in New York law and not a single client to his name.

In the spring of ’86, weeks before his graduation from Columbia Law School, Paul had been personally recruited by the venerable Walter Carter. Paul accepted a clerkship at Carter, Hornblower & Byrne, to apprentice with Mr. Carter himself. If there existed a law student in the city who was not after such a position, Paul hadn’t met him.

Which is why it felt like the whole world was collapsing when, only months later, the firm began to dissolve. Suddenly Carter and Byrne wouldn’t even speak to each other. Paul never learned the substance of their disagreement; at that point it didn’t matter. The two split off into different firms, and Paul needed to pick a side.

Byrne took Hornblower, as well as the majority of the clients and virtually all of the prestige. If Paul followed Byrne, he’d be a clerk at arguably the best-known firm in the city.

Carter’s new firm, by contrast, was to be a two-person operation. Three, if Paul joined. Carter had partnered with an untested attorney named Charles Hughes, actually even younger than Paul but also engaged to marry Carter’s daughter. Their family firm would have no clerks. It would boast no significant clients. "
B01H17U9OQ0,B01H17U9OQ,"His eyes rolled terribly. Yes: terribly. Or perhaps not so terribly. Perhaps they merely glanced about him, at the woman, at the bed, at the room. Growing up in the not infrequently perilous circumstances in which he had grown up, he was aware of the fragility of his body. He knew how little it took to make a man into meat: the wrong blow, the wrong gunshot, the wrong flick of a blade, turn of a car, presence of a microorganism in a handshake, a cough. He was aware that alone a person is almost nothing.

The woman who slept, slept alone. He who stood above her, stood alone. The bedroom door was shut. The window was open. He chose the window. He was through it in an instant, dropping silkily to the street below.

* * *

WHILE THIS INCIDENT was occurring in Australia, Saeed was picking up fresh bread for dinner and heading home. He was an independent-minded, grown man, unmarried, with a decent post and a good education, and as was the case in those days in his city with most independent-minded, grown men, unmarried, with decent posts and good educations, he lived with his parents."
B01H17U9OQ1,B01H17U9OQ,"The door to her closet was open. Her room was bathed in the glow of her computer charger and wireless router, but the closet doorway was dark, darker than night, a rectangle of complete darkness—the heart of darkness. And out of this darkness, a man was emerging.

He too was dark, with dark skin and dark, woolly hair. He wriggled with great effort, his hands gripping either side of the doorway as though pulling himself up against gravity, or against the rush of a monstrous tide. His neck followed his head, tendons straining, and then his chest, his half-unbuttoned, sweaty, gray-and-brown shirt. Suddenly he paused in his exertions. He looked around the room. He looked at the sleeping woman, the shut bedroom door, the open window. He rallied himself again, fighting mightily to come in, but in desperate silence, the silence of a man struggling in an alley, on the ground, late at night, to free himself of hands clenched around his throat. But there were no hands around this man’s throat. He wished only not to be heard.

With a final push he was through, trembling and sliding to the floor like a newborn foal. He lay still, spent. Tried not to pant. He rose."
B06XFPCVVD0,B06XFPCVVD,"This was going to be a high-profile case. That could cut both ways, of course, but he never shied away from a challenge and he felt pretty sure this one would be a winner. If anything so awful could be called a winner. Decapitation: that meant it was some sick, twisted perp, easily caught. And if she was some rich family’s daughter, it would mean priority for the lab work, allowing him to cut ahead of all the piece-of-shit cases waiting in line for the notoriously slow NYPD forensic labs.

The Evidence Gathering Team, all gowned up like surgeons, continued to work, crouching here and there, humped up and shuffling about like oversize white monkeys, sifting through the leaves one by one, examining the concrete floor of the garage, going over the door handle and windows, lifting prints from the broken glass on the floor—all by the book. They looked good, and Caruso was the best. They, too, sensed this was going to be a big case. With all the recent lab scandals they were taking extra care. And the two kids who’d found the body had been questioned right on the scene before being released to their parents. No shortcuts on this one."
B06XFPCVVD1,B06XFPCVVD,"Still the old bastard chased, screeching, with that baseball bat held high. But it seemed he was finally getting winded, dropping back a little. They turned onto another street. Up ahead Jacob could see the old shuttered automart, surrounded by a chain-link fence, where they were going to build apartments next spring. A while back, some kids had cut an opening in the fence. He dove for the opening, then crawled through, Ryan still following. Now Bascombe was really falling behind, still screeching threats.

Behind the automart was an industrial area with some dilapidated buildings. Jacob spied a nearby garage, with a peeling wooden door, and a broken window beside it. Bascombe was now out of sight. Maybe he gave up at the fence, but Jacob had a feeling the old fart was still following. They had to find a place to hide.

He tried the garage door; locked. Gingerly, he stuck his arm through the broken window, felt for the knob, turned it from the inside—and the door creaked open.

He went in, Ryan following, and carefully and quietly he shut the door and turned the bolt.

They stood there in the blackness, breathing hard, Jacob feeling like his lungs might burst, trying to stay silent."
B00JO8PEN20,B00JO8PEN2,"Don’t remember what it was like last time when the men limped home, faces burned, missing arms and legs …

Vianne clung to her husband’s hand as Antoine bought their tickets and led them onto the train. In the third-class carriage—stiflingly hot, people packed in like marsh reeds—she sat stiffly upright, still holding her husband’s hand, with her handbag on her lap.

At their destination, a dozen or so men disembarked. Vianne and Sophie and Antoine followed the others down a cobblestoned street and into a charming village that looked like most small communes in Touraine. How was it possible that war was coming and that this quaint town with its tumbling flowers and crumbling walls was amassing soldiers to fight?

Antoine tugged at her hand, got her moving again. When had she stopped?

Up ahead a set of tall, recently erected iron gates had been bolted into stone walls. Behind them were rows of temporary housing.

The gates swung open. A soldier on horseback rode out to greet the new arrivals, his leather saddle creaking at the horse’s steps, his face dusty and flushed from heat. He pulled on the reins and the horse halted, throwing its head and snorting."
B00JO8PEN21,B00JO8PEN2,"The three of them were silent as they left the house. They walked hand in hand up the hillside to the gray wooden barn. Knee-high golden grass covered the knoll, and lilac bushes as big as hay wagons grew along the perimeter of the property. Three small white crosses were all that remained in this world to mark the babies Vianne had lost. Today, she didn’t let her gaze linger there at all. Her emotions were heavy enough right now; she couldn’t add the weight of those memories, too.

Inside the barn sat their old, green Renault. When they were all in the automobile, Antoine started up the engine, backed out of the barn, and drove on browning ribbons of dead grass to the road. Vianne stared out the small, dusty window, watching the green valley pass in a blur of familiar images— red tile roofs, stone cottages, fields of hay and grapes, spindly-treed forests.

All too quickly they arrived at the train station near Tours.

The platform was filled with young men carrying suitcases and women kissing them good-bye and children crying.

A generation of men were going off to war. Again.

Don’t think about it, Vianne told herself. "
B07BK2GT560,B07BK2GT56,"I grab a spot at the back of the line queued up to enter the north tower at the cathedral of Notre Dame. Literally everyone is taking photos. And I’m not exaggerating. This is one of those times when literally literally applies.

Except me.

I set up an Instagram account a year ago, thinking I’d fill it with everything I longed to see in this city on that trip.

It went unused, and my shutterbug ways remained limited to the mundane, to everyday items I didn’t want to forget. The filter in my furnace so I’d remember which brand to buy. A shot of my insurance card when I renewed my license. Proof of a deposit to show the bank. My camera roll is littered with daily reminders of tasks, and only tasks.

I believe Paris is where you go to reinvent yourself.

That’s why I’m here.

To start over. To embrace life, opportunity, and beauty. And since change is the name of the game, I decide to capture what inspires me. I gaze at the spires of the cathedral, its massive archways, the sheer enormity of the fairy-tale-esque cathedral. I look at the real thing, but then, since I don’t want to forget it, I snap a photograph."
B07BK2GT561,B07BK2GT56,"It wasn’t even my dream, but I annexed it when I had to. Adopted it, if you will, when the dream’s owner died.

Then, for the final five minutes, I wandered. Contemplating.

Travel everywhere. Love the idea, but I haven’t saved quite enough yet to pull it off. I need to scrape together a little more, and with the bonus gone, I need more work.

Only I don’t have more work yet.

But here’s the thing. Bread can solve nearly every crummy situation. Nearly. That’s why I’m here at the bakery. Marie is behind the counter, wearing an orange apron that’s covered in flour. Her thick black hair is held in a hairnet.

I say hello to her in English, and she answers me back the same. It’s a running joke. The first time I came here, I was talking on the phone with a friend from home, and she greeted me in English, assuming I didn’t know her language.

She was surprised when I switched to her native tongue, which I do again right now. I order a baguette, and we chat briefly. Am I having a good day? she asks. I don’t need to unload on her, so I tell her my day is fine."
B007978PKY0,B007978PKY,"The night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. So the night passed. Together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until at last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The wind was in the East and all the mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light.

Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North-westward stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. Beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall Methedras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the Entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it."
B007978PKY1,B007978PKY,"As once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. Far away to the left the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. The dwellings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now hidden in mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. But now all the land was empty, and there was a silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.

At dusk they halted again. Now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of Rohan and the wall of the Emyn Muil was lost in the shadows of the East."
B01HMXRX020,B01HMXRX02,"Then the barstool fell through the floor and the whole world turned itself about.

But then, when Mahony looked around himself, everything was exactly the same. The same smeared mirrors over the same dirty seats. The same sad bastards falling into their glasses and the same smell crawling out of the gents.

Inside the envelope was a photograph of a girl with a half smile holding a blurred bundle, high and awkwardly, like found treasure. Mahony turned it over and the good solid schoolteacherly hand dealt him a left hook.

* * *

Your name is Francis Sweeney. Your mammy was Orla Sweeney. You are from Mulderrig, Co. Mayo. This is a picture of yourself and her. For your information she was the curse of the town, so they took her from you. They all lie, so watch yourself, and know that your mammy loved you.

* * *

His mammy had loved him. Past tense. Mammy was past tense.

They took her from him. Where did they take her?

Mahony turned over the photograph and studied her face. God, she looked young. He would have put her as his sister rather. She couldn’t have been more than fourteen.

And his name was Francis. He’d keep that to himself."
B01HMXRX021,B01HMXRX02,"He couldn’t light a cigarette or pick up his pint, he couldn’t move, the sweat was pouring off him. He closed his eyes and right there in his memory he found Sister Mary Margaret, as she was the last time he saw her.

* * *

He was not even seven. At first he had held back from climbing up, for fear that he would break her. But Sister Mary Margaret had smiled down at him, so he scaled the arctic landscape of the bed. Without that smile he wouldn’t have known her.

Sister Mary Margaret had a cancer the size of a man’s head in her stomach and was as good as dead under the ground. That’s what they had told him but he’d come to see for himself.

He sat next to Sister Mary Margaret and let her wipe his nose with her handkerchief although he was too old for it. It took her hours because she kept falling asleep. He had wished to God that he wasn’t trailing great lanes of snot. But Mahony always had a cold from the fact that the tops of his fingers were often blue and his socks were never quite dry."
B003672JHG0,B003672JHG,"Its ornate gate was twined with brown vines; come summer, that gate would be a profusion of green leaves and white flowers. Now it glittered with frost.

And there she was: her eighty-something-year-old mother, bundled up in blankets, sitting on the black bench in her so-called winter garden. A light snow began to fall; tiny flakes blurred the scene into an impressionistic painting where nothing looked solid enough to touch. Sculpted bushes and a single birdbath were covered in snow, giving the garden a strange, otherworldly look. Not surprisingly, her mother sat in the middle of it all, motionless, her hands clasped in her lap.

As a child it had scared Meredith—all that solitude in her mother—but as she got older it had begun to embarrass, then irritate her. A woman of her mother’s age had no business sitting alone in the cold. Her mother claimed it was because of her ruined vision, but Meredith didn’t believe that. It was true that her mother’s eyes didn’t process color— she saw only white and black and shades of gray—but that had never struck Meredith, even as a girl, as a reason for staring at nothing.

She opened the door and went out into the cold. "
B003672JHG1,B003672JHG,"Leave it to her mother to build something so absurdly out of place. A Russian dacha, or summerhouse, in Western Washington State. Even the orchard’s name was absurd. Belye Nochi.

White Nights indeed. The nights here were as dark as new asphalt.

Not that Mom cared about what was around her. She got her way, that was all. Whatever Anya Whitson wanted, her husband gave to her, and apparently she’d wanted a fairy-tale castle and an orchard with an unpronounceable Russian name.

Meredith knocked and went inside. The kitchen was empty; a big pot of soup simmered on the stove.

In the living room, light spilled through the two-story rounded wall of windows at the north end of the room—the famous Belye Nochi turret. Wood floors gleamed with the golden beeswax that Mom insisted on using, even though it turned the floors into a skating rink if you dared to walk in stockinged feet. A huge stone fireplace dominated the center wall; clustered around it was a grouping of richly upholstered antique sofas and chairs. Above the fireplace hung an oil painting of a Russian troika—a romantic-looking carriage drawn by matching horses—sailing through a field of snow. Pure Doctor Zhivago. "
B07965H9F10,B07965H9F1,"A thoroughly pissed-off Caeco tore through the thin material and jabbed those same sharpened fingernails at Reddy’s face. Reddy leaned back but a jack-hammering knee smashed into his privates so fast, I couldn’t count the impacts. Then a small fist with the clenched density of steel pistoned into Reddy’s throat and face like a junkyard car crusher.

Reddy fell back and almost onto the poor woman in the emergency bed one over from mine. Not sure what she was in for, but she was in a gown under the covers and was pretty much out of it.

Nope, not cool . I interceded. Reddy fell backward and stopped against a wall of nothing. Gotta give him this, his recovery time was pretty damned quick. He bounced right back up with a front kick that was so fast, Caeco’s block missed it completely. It hammered her in the gut, knocking her flying into the wall. He started to turn my way but a blur wearing a government-approved suit caught him before he got even halfway around.

Krupp and Gina came barreling in, each with a gun, which wasn’t surprising with Krupp but was with Gina. I guess once a cop, always a cop.

Reddy and junior G-girl were a spinning whirlwind of blows, kicks, and elbow strikes. "
B07965H9F11,B07965H9F1,"The girl fell forward and I saw the back of her hoodie was completely soaked through like she’d fallen into five inches of water. The man fell backward, body rigid, eyes staring straight up, mouth and lips drawn into a hideous, teeth-baring grin.

Students started to gather, and the driver of the pickup was helping the kicked girl get back to her feet.

More people arrived and someone pushed a cloth against my bleeding head, telling me that I was going to be all right, that head wounds always bled like crazy. I held the piece of cloth as the guy moved over to the hostage. He seemed to know what he was doing, like EMT training or something. Sirens filled the air, the sound getting louder by the second. A group of college kids gathered around the fallen assailant, cell phones out, filming away. A campus police SUV squealed to a halt, lights flashing.

Two hours later, I was still sitting in the UVM Medical Center Emergency room, trying to keep my hands away from the bandage on my forehead and finishing my statement to the police. Gina Velasquez sat near me, listening carefully as I explained that I had no idea what had happened."
B0015DWJX20,B0015DWJX2,"The women I’ve met have told me such war stories of their own, I almost wish I had my column back. Yesterday, I had a lovely, gossipy chat with a Norwich lady. She has four daughters in their teens, and just last week, the eldest was invited to tea at the cadet school in town. Arrayed in her finest frock and spotless white gloves, the girl made her way to the school, stepped over the threshold, took one look at the sea of shining cadet faces before her—and fainted dead away! The poor child had never seen so many males in one place in her life. Think of it— a whole generation grown up without dances or teas or flirting.

I love seeing the bookshops and meeting the booksellers—booksellers really are a special breed. No one in their right mind would take up clerking in a bookstore for the salary, and no one in his right mind would want to own one—the margin of profit is too small. So, it has to be a love of readers and reading that makes them do it—along with first dibs on the new books.

Do you remember the first job your sister and I had in London? In crabby Mr. Hawke’s secondhand bookshop? How I loved him— "
B0015DWJX21,B0015DWJX2,"Susan said the guests at Abbot’s book tea enjoyed themselves immensely—and I know I did. I was able to un-stick my tongue from the roof of my mouth after the first two minutes and began to have quite a good time.

Susan and I are off tomorrow for bookshops in Colchester, Norwich, King’s Lynn, Bradford, and Leeds.

Love and thanks,

Juliet


From Juliet to Sidney

21st January, 1946

Dear Sidney,

Night-time train travel is wonderful again! No standing in the corridors for hours, no being shunted off for a troop train to pass, and above all, no black-out curtains. All the windows we passed were lighted, and I could snoop once more. I missed it so terribly during the war. I felt as if we had all turned into moles scuttling along in our separate tunnels. I don’t consider myself a real peeper—they go in for bedrooms, but it’s families in sitting rooms or kitchens that thrill me. I can imagine their entire lives from a glimpse of bookshelves, or desks, or lit candles, or bright sofa cushions.

There was a nasty, condescending man in Tillman’s bookshop today. After my talk about Izzy, I asked if anyone had questions. He literally leapt from his seat to go nose-to-nose with me— "
B0752F1TLR0,B0752F1TLR,"I’m sure I’m reacting this way because I haven’t had sex in months, ever since Ingrid left me. That’s it; this isn’t about Diane, this is just about me having gone too long without a woman. It’s decided— I’m getting laid as soon as Diane and I are done, and I won’t be picky. The first pretty face who falls into my lap will do just to take the edge off.

Because, heaven help me, that edge will be the size of Everest by then.

I stare out the window, surprised to see we’re passing by the imposing red gate of the Hôtel d’Hozier and other familiar buildings on rue Vieille du Temple. The taxi is taking us to the left bank through Le Marais. This itinerary is practicable only by night. By day, my neighborhood’s mesh of one-way streets makes it a nightmare to drive through.

My town house is just a few blocks away, hidden from sight behind a walled garden, as a self-respecting Parisian hôtel particulier should be. It hasn’t been in the family for very long—only half a century— but I hope it’ll stay for generations to come.

Half an hour later, the cab pulls up outside Diane’s building. "
B0752F1TLR1,B0752F1TLR,"My goals, my company, the whole world becomes unimportant as her delicious scent fills my nostrils and the softness of her lips overtakes my mind. So warm, so yielding. I’ve tried meditating with the best coaches in France and abroad to achieve the state of mindful relaxation wherein I empty my head and let go of all my worries.

I swear I have yet to find a shorter path to that coveted state than kissing Diane Petit.

She wraps her arms around my neck, melding her body to mine.

A camera clicks.

I graze her lips and tease them apart.

She lets me. Holding her tight, I stroke her back. My right hand slides to her glorious bottom and stays there, fingers splayed but not daring to squeeze. The temptation to slip my tongue between her soft lips and drink in the taste of her mouth is so strong I can barely resist it.

No tongues, I remind myself. She doesn’t want tongues. She was very clear on that point.

Diane’s hand runs up and down my nape, clutching the back of my neck as if she means it.

It’s just for show. It’s just for show. It’s just for—"
B01NCWCUN10,B01NCWCUN1,"There were some very dark times that winter, but Joy never lost her will to live, and did whatever she had to do to be cured. She said afterward that she did it for Camille and Christophe, and a year later, she was cancer free, in remission, and they could all breathe again. It had been a harrowing year, and the fact that Camille had been accepted at Stanford meant nothing to any of them until after they knew that Joy was healthy again.

She and Christophe celebrated Camille’s high school graduation, and gave her a party just before school ended, on her eighteenth birthday. All was right in their world again. The party was for young people Camille’s age, mostly her classmates, and a group of parents had come to enjoy the party with Joy and Christophe. The Marshalls were there and they said Phillip was traveling constantly now, working on promoting their wines and doing well. He had spent six months in Chile, working at a friend’s winery, and he had been in Cape Town the year before, since both were grape-growing regions often compared to the Napa Valley. He was learning the business all around the world."
B01NCWCUN11,B01NCWCUN1,"Like her father, she didn’t want to live in France, and Joy agreed with both of them. The Marshalls remained their closest friends, and Phillip alternated between being Camille’s nemesis and her hero as he grew up. Seven years older than she was, he teased her a lot. He was a senior in high school when she was only ten. But more than once, he had protected her if he saw anyone bullying her when he was around. She was like a little sister to him and she was sad when he went away to college and she only saw him during vacations after that.

—

Joy was forty-four, and Christophe a year older, the summer Camille turned seventeen, when Joy discovered she had breast cancer in a routine mammogram, and it rocked their world. The doctors decided to remove only the lump and not the breast, and thought they could cure her with aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for a year. Christophe was beside himself, and Joy was desperately ill after her treatments, but she went to the winery for a short time every day, and Camille did everything she could to help her. Joy was incredibly courageous, and determined to beat the dreaded disease. "
B00CQZ6EKW0,B00CQZ6EKW,"The car in front of Sookie moved one space closer to the teller, and she moved up with it. She looked at herself in the mirror again. She looked a little better with her makeup on, but, of course, she had forgotten to put on her earrings. Honestly, between the weddings and dealing with her mother, it really was a miracle she was still sane at all.

She had always had a delicate nervous system and a tendency to faint under pressure. And it was very stressful never knowing what her mother was going to do next. Lenore had shown up at Ce Ce’s wedding wearing a large yellow hat with two live lovebirds in a cage sitting on top. God only knows where she got that.

Thank heavens, all Sookie’s kids had been good kids, because when they were growing up, she had let them do pretty much what they pleased. She had wanted them to have a carefree childhood. Hers certainly hadn’t been, with Lenore pushing her into everything. She had always been basically shy. She never wanted to be a Magnolia Trail Maiden or a cheerleader or to join all those organizations. But she had had no choice. "
B00CQZ6EKW1,B00CQZ6EKW,"First, to proudly carry on the Simmons family line that, according to Lenore, could be traced all the way back to fifteenth-century England. Second, to protect the family silver.

It was such a beautiful warm day, and after Sookie left her mother’s house, she took her shoes off and walked back home along the bay. As she strolled along, she suddenly wondered how many times she and the children had walked back and forth to Lenore’s house over the years. It seemed like only yesterday when all day long, the kids were running back and forth to her house and theirs.

Time was so strange. When the children were younger, she used to marvel at the tiny little footsteps they left in the sand, but those days were gone forever. They were all grown up now … and, bless their hearts, not a one of them had the Simmons foot, and three had the Poole ears. But that was another story.

A few minutes later, after she had thrown on a little makeup, Sookie drove back to town and was sitting in line at the drive-in bank waiting to make a deposit to cover yet another one of Lenore’s unexpected expenses. "
B01NCUXEFR0,B01NCUXEFR,"I was successful at my gig because I knew how to sell things. The week before, I closed a nice adoption at my alma mater, and I was in the running for one at Georgia State. It didn’t make me a mogul, but I was looking forward to a bonus hefty enough to start talking about buying a new house. Nothing was wrong with our current abode, a solid ranch house on a quiet street. It’s just that it was a wedding gift from her parents, her childhood home, deeded over to their only daughter, and only to her. It was like white people do, a leg up, American style. But I kind of wanted to hang my hat on a peg with my own name on it.

This was on my mind but not on my spirit as we drove up I-10 on our way to Eloe. We settled down after our anniversary skirmish and we were back in rhythm with each other. Old-school hip-hop thumped from the stereo of our Honda Accord, a family kind of car with two empty seats in the back.

Six hours in, I clicked on the blinker at exit 163. As we merged onto a two-lane highway, I felt a change in Celestial. "
B01NCUXEFR1,B01NCUXEFR,"I’m into the museum-quality marbles and the delicate line drawings, but the dolls were something that an ordinary person could get behind. My vision was a line of cloth dolls that we were going to sell wholesale. You could display them on a shelf or hug the stuffing out of them. There would still be the high-end custom jobs and art pieces. Those could fetch five figures, easy. But the everyday dolls were going to make her mark, I told her. And you see, I turned out to be right.

I know that all of this is water under the bridge, and not a sweet little creek either. But to be fair, I have to tell this whole story. We were married only a year and some change, but it was a good year. Even she would have to admit that.

A meteor crashed our life on Labor Day weekend when we went to Eloe to visit my parents. We traveled by car because I liked a road trip. Planes, I associated with my job. Back then, I was a rep for a textbook company, specializing in math books, even though my way with numbers ended with my 12 times tables. "
B0192CTMWI0,B0192CTMWI,"In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.

Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. "
B0192CTMWI1,B0192CTMWI,"He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself.

Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). "
B071GYV5D40,B071GYV5D4,"My bullshit detector, honed to perfection by my former boss, quivered like a flagpole in the wind.

My reservations aside, Lukas jumped into action and, in a move of complete optimism, leased a new space with a conference room and parking lot, hoping to bring in some bigger clients. It worked. In addition to beefing up our local roster, we scored an Italian gelato company eager to break into the American market, a nationally distributed brand of caramel-cheese popcorn, a company dedicated to 100 percent eco-friendly paint, and an ancient cast-iron cookware company looking to ditch their stodgy image. I smiled to think of Big Frank’s reaction to our success. He would have been proud.

It wasn’t until a few weeks later that I was able to identify why my bullshit detector had gone off. Jackie and I sat on the fire escape silently sharing a sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mints. Lost in thought, I remembered Lukas’s first afternoon. With all the talk of honoring Big Frank and his vision and keeping clients happy, Lukas hadn’t said a thing about doing right by us.

When I arrived at work, sweating through my gray suit, the first sign that something was awry was an actual sign."
B071GYV5D41,B071GYV5D4,"Big Frank’s genes came through in ways Frank, Jr. tried to hide, his hair carefully disheveled to disguise a premature bald spot, silver rings to dress up Sicilian workingman’s hands, a laugh that seemed too hearty for his body. These ghosts of Big Frank had me nodding my head in agreement when Frank, Jr. enthusiastically vowed to make the changes his father had only dreamed of. I never thought Big Frank was much of a dreamer; he was a doer. But if his son had both qualities, Giacomo might survive.

I’d met Frank, Jr. a few times over the years, and it was hard to see him as something other than a kid, until he held a staff meeting with his nervous employees: me; Jackie, the shy, acid-washed-jeans-wearing designer who had been at Giacomo even longer than I had, and a random collection of young designers Big Frank hired when he decided to expand the company after we had a good run— Rhiannon, Seth, Byron, and the timid, newest hire, Glynnis.

On Frank, Jr. ’s first day, we had assembled in Big Frank’s office, where the walls still exuded cigar smoke. Frank, Jr. held his hands in a namaste style and seemed at a loss for words. "
B00GET18P20,B00GET18P2,"He couldn’t remember what it said in her file, but Control thought she was probably almost as tall as him. She had been held in the eastern wing of the building for two weeks now, with nothing to do but eat and exercise.

Before going on the expedition, the biologist had received intense survival and weapons training at a Central facility devoted to that purpose. She would have been briefed with whatever half-truths the Southern Reach’s command and control deemed useful, based on criteria Control still found arcane, even murky. She would have been subjected to conditioning to make her more receptive to hypnotic suggestion.

* * *

The psychologist/director would have been given any number of hypnotic cues to use—words that, in certain combinations, would induce certain effects. Passing thought as the door shut behind Control: Had the director had anything to do with muddying their memories, while they were still in Area X?

Control slid into a chair across from the biologist, aware that Grace, at the very least, watched them through the one-way glass. Experts had questioned the biologist, but Control was also a kind of expert, and he needed to have the direct contact. There was something in the texture of a face-to-face interview that transcripts and videotape lacked."
B00GET18P21,B00GET18P2,"Things that showed themselves in the empty spaces, making Control unwilling to say her words aloud for fear that somehow he did not really understand the undercurrents and hidden references. A detached description of a thistle … A mention of a lighthouse. A sentence or two describing the quality of the light on the marshes in Area X. None of it should have gotten to him, yet he felt her there, somehow, looking over his shoulder in a way not evoked by the interviews with the other expedition members.

The biologist claimed to remember as little as the others.

Control knew that for a lie—or it would become a lie if he drew her out. Did he want to draw her out? Was she cautious because something had happened in Area X or because she was just built that way? A shadow had passed over the director’s desk then. He’d been here before, or somewhere close, making these kinds of decisions before, and it had almost broken him, or broken through him. But he had no choice.

About seven hundred words after she came back. Just like the other two. But unlike them, that was roughly comparable to her terseness before she had left. And there were the odd specifics that the others lacked. "
B075VVRTJ70,B075VVRTJ7,"Didn't matter the time of day, he’d wag his tail so hard sometimes he’d knock himself over. I’d adopted him when he was only six weeks old. Now he was four, but I swear, he still acted like a puppy, loved to be held.

My boy was a good-sized dog, a Labrador/terrier mix—plus some other stuff, I was sure—so the best kind of dog, with the best personality traits from each breed in his ancestry. Smart, friendly, gentle and patient with kids. I was convinced that dog had a sixth sense about things, especially people.

For example, Wally didn’t like Seamus. Every time he’d come around, Wally would growl and bark, didn’t want Seamus touching him.

He knew my brother was a nasty fucker. You could tell a lot about a person based on how they interacted with animals. I didn’t trust people who didn’t like dogs; they’re not my people. How could you dislike dogs? They’re the best fucking thing about this planet, with hockey, sex, and a good Irish whiskey taking places two, three, and four.

Plus, dogs were loyal. There’s nothing more loyal than a dog. Probably because they had their priorities straight: food, sleep, and chasing shit.

But enough about my awesome dog, for now."
B075VVRTJ71,B075VVRTJ7,"Me moving home to Boston and buying a house on her street.

Me going to stay for every major holiday for the rest of my life.

Me asking her advice about every major decision for the rest of my life.

Four of the five weren’t possible. They just weren’t. The first three because they were impossible for me to do within the next twenty-four hours, and the last one wasn’t going to happen because I wasn’t a helpless asshole.

Number four would have to do it. I’d pledge at least five years of holidays as penance. So be it.

Plus, I was going to have to make up a lie about why I hadn’t called yet, and it was going to have to be good. If I told her the truth, that I’d forgotten, it would legitimately hurt her feelings. There was nothing I wouldn’t do—including lie, cheat, and steal—to avoid hurting my mom’s feelings.

Getting on the elevator, I pressed the button for my floor and leaned against the cushioned velvet wall, tired. So damn tired. I couldn’t wait to sleep in my own bed.

But first things first. I’d apologize to Steven and then spend some time with Wally while I called my mom."
B01M14UN1J0,B01M14UN1J,"But I don’t know the strange, sharp language Queenie learned from the family she left behind when she ran off to the river with Briny. The few Polish words I have would be a mouthful of nonsense if I strung them together. Even so, if I could grab Queenie’s cross in my hand just now, I’d say them to the tin man Queenie kisses when the storms come.

I’d try pretty near anything to help get the birthing over with and see Queenie smile again.

On the other side of the door, Briny’s boot scrapes the planks, and I hear the cross clatter over the floor. Briny looks out the cloudy window that came from the farmhouse he tore down to build the boat before I was ever born. With Briny’s mama on her deathbed and the crops droughted out for another year, the banker was gonna get the house anyway. Briny figured the river was the place to be. He was right too. Time the Depression hit, him and Queenie were living just fine on the water. Even the Depression can’t starve the river, he says every time he tells the story. The river’s got her own magic. She takes care of her people. Always will."
B01M14UN1J1,B01M14UN1J,"As soon as I call her Fern, I know it’s not Fern I’m thinking of. I’ve gone even further back. It’s Queenie I see.

Queenie, our strong mama, who marked all of us with her lovely golden curls. All but poor Camellia.

My mind skitters featherlight across treetops and along valley floors. I travel all the way to a low-slung Mississippi riverbank to the last time I saw Queenie. The warm, soft air of that Memphis summer night swirls over me, but the night is an impostor.

It is not soft. It does not forgive.

From this night, there will be no returning.

Twelve years old, still thin and knobby as a front porch post, I dangle my legs under the rail of our shantyboat, watching for a gator’s eyes to catch the amber flicker of lantern light. Gators shouldn’t stray this far upwater on the Mississippi, but there’s been gossip about sightings around here lately. This makes looking for them a game of sorts. Shantyboat kids take their entertainment where they can find it.

Right now, we need a distraction worse than usual.

Beside me, Fern climbs the rail and searches the woods for fireflies. At nearly four years old, she’s learning to count them. "
B071Y37P870,B071Y37P87,"Uncross your knives, she’d insist if there was a quarrel at the table. Butter melting in a dish meant someone nearby was in love, and a bird in the house could take your bad luck out the window. She insisted that her children wear blue for protection and carry packets of lavender in their pockets, though Franny always threw the packets away the minute she was out of her mother’s sight.

They began to wonder if their mother wasn’t a spy. Russia was the enemy, and at Starling students were often made to crouch beneath their desks, hands over their heads, for bomb-safety drills. Spies had no family connections and dubious histories, just as their mother had, and they spoke in double-talk, as she did. They fudged their histories to protect their true backgrounds and intentions, and Susanna never mentioned attending college nor did she discuss where she grew up or reveal anything about her parents, other than claiming they had died young while on a cruise. The Owens children knew only the slimmest facts: Susanna had grown up in Boston and been a model in Paris before settling down with the children’s father, who was an orphan with no family of his own. "
B071Y37P871,B071Y37P87,"Luckily for them, their father was preoccupied with his patients, who furtively made their way inside through a separate entrance before descending to a basement office in the Owenses’ town house. While therapy was in progress, Vincent often sneaked down to the coat closet to search a patient’s pockets for cash, mints, and Valium. Then all three children would lie on the kitchen floor, relaxed by the little yellow pills Vincent had found, sucking on Brach’s Ice Blue mints as they listened in to the sobbing confessions that filtered up through the heating vent. Due to these eavesdropping sessions they knew about obsessions, depressions, manias, sexual appetites, and transference long before most people their age knew what a psychiatrist was.

Every year a box of lavender-scented black soap wrapped in crinkly cellophane would arrive from Massachusetts. Susanna refused to say who the sender was, yet she faithfully washed with it. Perhaps that was why she had such a creamy, radiant complexion. Franny discovered the potential of the soap after she nicked a bar one Christmas. When she and Jet sampled it, the soap caused their skin to shine, but it also made them so silly they couldn’t stop laughing. They filled the sink with bubbles and splashed water at each other and were soon soaked to the skin. "
B072HLRWDJ0,B072HLRWDJ,"That’s why I started it because if it were as easy as I thought it was going to be, I’d know we’d be okay. I guess it was kind of a test. God, that sounds awful. Not like a math test or a trial. More like, what’s it called? Litmus. Still bad, I know. The point is I expected the reasons to just stack up neatly—click, click, click. But then I got stuck, and even some of the items I was dead sure about seemed, I don’t know, flimsy? But the worst part is that the more I worked on the list, the more I realized how terribly, awfully much was riding on it. Which is so wrong and stupid. The whole thing reeks of betrayal, not only making the list, not only not being able to finish it, but being desperate to finish it. Because I’ve already said yes, and this ship is smack in the middle of the ocean, no getting off, and Zach’s a good person; he deserves better than a stupid list or than a-a-a fiancée who would make one. And listen to me: I can hardly even get my mouth around the word fiancée! What in God’s name will I do with wife? "
B072HLRWDJ1,B072HLRWDJ,"I dropped the rags of iris onto the tabletop, stared down at my hands, which were sticky as a murderer’s, and sighed. It wasn’t that it was hard to think up reasons why anyone would want to marry Zach. He was so generally, generically marriageable it was almost funny. Handsome, smart, hardworking. A law school star from a wealthy family. No criminal record. Good manners. Naturally curly hair. A golden boy if ever I’d seen one: wheat-colored curls, tawny brows and lashes, eyes the color of India pale ale. Even his car was gold. The man was a bona fide catch. Give him a chaise and four, an estate, and ten thousand pounds a year, and any Austen heroine would go stumbling over the countryside in her Regency heels to get to him.

No, if my task had been to list reasons why anyone should marry Zach, I could have reeled them off, lickety-split, and mangled no flowers in the process. But here at what was surely the eleventh hour—God, eleventh and a half—I was hell-bent on coming up with reasons why I should, a different matter entirely.

My mother dunked a paper towel into one of the flower buckets and handed it to me. "
B078RJV3Y80,B078RJV3Y8,"It seemed Vice Salvatore may have cured me of becoming a stuttering fool with any good-looking man. All I had to do was picture him and how much he peeved me off to bring my anger forth.

Chapter THREE

Two weeks. It took me two weeks to calm my nerves and stop thinking Mr. Salvatore would pop back into the store and fire me. I needed and loved my job… well, until my own business was 100 percent profitable. Unfortunately, I couldn’t keep the man out of my head. He even starred in some of the steamy dreams I had that involved spanking. No matter what I did, where I was, my mind conjured up the picture of him standing at the counter with his arms crossed over his broad chest, scowling.

Thankfully, it was Molly’s thirty-fifth birthday, and we were headed to meet Clinton at the restaurant he’d picked, so I hoped with a few drinks and some inspirational words from my best friend, all thoughts of Mr. Salvatore would disappear. Not that I’d told her anything yet; I knew she would get annoyed on my behalf, so I was waiting for the drinking part of the night to begin, and for us to be around Clint; he seemed to calm her temper quickly."
B078RJV3Y81,B078RJV3Y8,"It was a part of life… which was why I missed it so much. John had always been good in the bedroom. It was why I hadn’t seen his cheating coming since he’d slept with me just two days before he said he was leaving. Yes, we fought, mainly over my weight, but if he couldn’t take me for who I was, then he wasn’t worth having in my life and bed. Something I told him after I slashed his tires and he called me a crazy bitch.

The bell over the door rang as someone opened it. I placed a wide smile on my face, only to freeze when my wet dream walked into the store.

Oh, God. He was… stunningly hot.

I was going to choke and burn.

He glanced over his shoulder and smiled when a woman entered just after him. I let out a whoosh of air that had caught in my lungs. When I knew the hot guy, like Clint, for instance, was taken, I was totally fine around them.

Although, I couldn’t help but feel the sad dip in my belly knowing the man candy in front of me was taken. Then again, he was totally out of my league. "
B01M3SG5WR0,B01M3SG5WR,"To her, A CertainTea offered a new beginning, but it didn’t stir her soul.

Alec milled around the kitchen, occasionally stopping to turn one way or another, as if envisioning people working there, checking on the functionality of the space. With each step, his posture relaxed. The lines between his brows faded, and he let out a satisfied sigh, like that of a man who’d come home after a long journey.

His transformation unlocked a piece of her guarded heart. She almost said something, but then he wandered into the walk-in refrigerator and the moment was lost.

Maybe her qualms about working with a living, breathing reminder of the past had overshadowed the merits of her brother’s decision. Reconnecting with Alec might not only be the best thing for the restaurant, it might also help restore a friendship. Given the way she’d retreated from the world in recent years, she could use a friend.

Alec stepped out of the refrigerator, smiling. Not the old smile she remembered—that slightly shy but sincere one. This smile, more of a grin, really, at least was genuine. The first genuinely happy expression she’d seen him wear in two years.

Of course, that thought reminded her of the date. Of the death. "
B01M3SG5WR1,B01M3SG5WR,"Like tears, she thought. She started the car and let the automatic wipers clear them away before heading out of the cemetery, toward her new venture, A CertainTea.

Toward the future.

Even the rain couldn’t mar the sight of the newly renovated restaurant. The elegant, one-story glass-and-stone structure sat at the end of a private driveway, amid a wooded, two-acre parcel bordered on one side by Lake Sandy. A lush, manicured lawn sloped toward the hexagonal cedar gazebo at the water’s edge, where visitors could enjoy a panorama of the four-hundred-acre lake and its shoreline, which was dotted by private homes, docks, and boats.

Colby could hardly wait to be surrounded by families celebrating engagements, birthdays, and anniversaries here. Celebrating life!

Convinced that hosting other people’s happiest moments in this peaceful setting would draw her from her perpetual state of limbo, she’d persuaded her father to invest some of Cabot Tea Company’s funds in this endeavor. Of course, that purse had strings. Technically, CTC owned A CertainTea. She’d manage it, but she’d report to her brother, Hunter.

She accepted that condition because CTC had assumed all the risk. It wasn’t like her former legal career had prepared her to be a restaurateur. "
B07439ZZVX0,B07439ZZVX,"He would likely never see my uncle again. And neither of them was exactly young anymore.

Once again, my father managed to put together a massive sum of money, this time using it to buy a three-ton truck, which he shipped to North Korea. My uncle had written in one of his letters that if he had had a truck, he might be appointed the head of the local neighborhood association or something. Along with the truck, my father sent a letter, explaining his change of citizenship. We never heard from my uncle again.

Soon after I entered my final year of junior high school, my old man jetted off to Hawaii with my mother (who had also become a South Korean citizen by then).

Aloha!

Now a huge framed photo of a pretty Hawaiian girl in a straw skirt kissing my father on the cheek decorates the foyer of the house. In it, he’s wearing a hibiscus lei around his neck, grinning from ear to ear as he flashes the peace sign. With both hands.

Jackass.

And me?

Finally, I can talk about me. This isn’t a story about my father or mother, after all. This story is about me."
B07439ZZVX1,B07439ZZVX,"My aging father, having switched his citizenship twice by a young age, was now attempting to change it a third time. He couldn’t get a visa as a North Korean because that country didn’t have diplomatic relations with the United States. Since North Korea had so few diplomatic ties with other countries, North Korean residents of Japan were limited in where they could travel. I’ve heard that you can get a visa for some countries, but with the red tape and hassle, there was no telling how long that could take.

So what my father did was appeal to a Mindan leader. Ready for some more tedious explanation? Here goes . . .

In Japan, there are basically two ethnic Korean organizations: Chongryon and Mindan. Generally, North Korean residents of Japan associate with Chongryon and South Korean residents with Mindan. Reflecting the relationship between North and South Korea, and like the feuding Montagues and Capulets, the two groups clash every now and then but maintain a reasonable distance from one another. You know how Romeo and Juliet ended, right?

Long ago, my father had been an active member of Chongryon. He spent all his free time fighting for the rights of fellow North Koreans living in Japan and donated tons— "
B001C4NXKM0,B001C4NXKM,"Alice Underwood fixed him three eggs, bacon, toast, juice, coffee. When he had finished all but the coffee, he lit a cigarette and pushed back from the table. She flashed the cigarette a disapproving look but said nothing. That restored some of his confidence—some, but not much. She had always been good at biding her time.

She dropped the iron spider skillet into the gray dishwater and it hissed a little. She hadn’t changed much, Larry was thinking. A little older—she would be fifty-one now—a little grayer, but there was still plenty of black left in that sensibly netted head of hair. She was wearing a plain gray dress, probably the one she worked in. Her bosom was still the same large comber blooming out of the bodice of the dress—a little larger, if anything. Mom, tell me the truth, has your bosom gotten bigger? Is that the fundamental change?

He started to tap cigarette ashes into his coffee saucer; she jerked it away and replaced it with the ashtray she always kept in the cupboard. The saucer had been sloppy with coffee and it had seemed okay to tap in it. The ashtray was clean, reproachfully spotless, and he tapped into it with a slight pang. "
B001C4NXKM1,B001C4NXKM,"And then it was June 13, six days ago, the day Wayne Stukey asked Larry to go for a walk with him down the beach. It had only been nine in the morning but the stereo was on, both TVs, and it sounded like an orgy was going on in the basement playroom. Larry had been sitting in an overstuffed living room chair, wearing only underpants, and trying owlishly to get the sense from a Superboy comic book. He felt very alert, but none of the words seemed to connect to anything. There was no gestalt. A Wagner piece was thundering from the quad speakers, and Wayne had to shout three or four times to make himself understood. Then Larry nodded. He felt as if he could walk for miles.

But when the sunlight struck Larry’s eyeballs like needles, he suddenly changed his mind. No walk. Uh-uh. His eyes had been turned into magnifying glasses, and soon the sun would shine through them long enough to set his brains on fire. His poor old brains felt tinder-dry.

Wayne, gripping his arm firmly, insisted. They went down to the beach, over the warming sand to the darker brown hardpack, and Larry decided it had been a pretty good idea after all. The deepening sound of the breakers coming home was soothing. "
B017RNBRRW0,B017RNBRRW,"He loves soccer even more than he loves telling everyone how much something costs after he’s bought it.

During the big soccer championships, the crossword supplements are replaced by special soccer sections, and after that it’s hardly possible to get a sensible word out of Kent. If Britt-Marie asks what he wants for dinner, he just mumbles that it doesn’t matter, without even taking his eyes off the page.

Britt-Marie has never forgiven soccer for that. For taking Kent away from her, and for depriving her of her crossword supplement.

She rubs the white mark on her ring finger. She remembers the last time the morning newspaper replaced the crossword supplement with a soccer section, because she read the newspaper four times in the hope of finding a small, hidden crossword somewhere. She never found one, but she did find an article about a woman, the same age as Britt-Marie, who had died. Britt-Marie can’t get it out of her head. The article described how the woman had lain dead for several weeks before she was found, after the neighbors made a complaint about a bad smell from her flat. Britt-Marie can’t stop thinking about that article, can’t stop thinking about how vexatious it would be if the neighbors started complaining about bad smells. "
B017RNBRRW1,B017RNBRRW,"Kent always pushes the shopping cart while Britt-Marie walks at his side and holds on to a corner of it. Not because she’s trying to steer, only that she likes holding on to things while he is also holding on to them. For the sake of that feeling they are going somewhere at the same time.

She eats her dinner cold at exactly six o’clock. She’s used to sitting up all night waiting for Kent, so she tries to put his portion in the fridge. But the only fridge here is full of very small bottles of alcohol. She lowers herself onto a bed that isn’t hers, while rubbing her ring finger, a habit she falls into when she’s nervous.

A few days ago she was sitting on her own bed, spinning her wedding ring, after cleaning the mattress extra carefully with baking soda. Now she’s rubbing the white mark on her skin where the ring used to be.

The building has an address, but it’s certainly neither a place to live nor a home. On the floor are two rectangular plastic boxes for balcony flowers, but the hostel room doesn’t have a balcony. Britt-Marie has no one to sit up all night waiting for.

But she sits up anyway.

B0192CTMW80,B0192CTMW8,"But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. . . .

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes —

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves."
B0192CTMW81,B0192CTMW8,"At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous . . . but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.

The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely . . ."

He was on White Plains Road when the call came in. Four minutes later, he closed his flip phone and laughed. He pounded the steering wheel and laughed even louder: jubilant, bemused, incredulous. If he had been driving in New Town, Limbe, he would have gotten out of the car and hugged someone on the street, telling them, Bo, you won’t even believe the news I just got. In New Town, he would have known at least one person on the street with whom to share his good news, but here, on these streets of old brick houses and faded lawns in the Bronx, he knew no one he could run to and repeat what Clark’s secretary had just told him. There was a young black man walking with headphones on, banging his head to some kind of good music; three teenage Asian girls covering their mouths and giggling, none of them with a school bag; a woman rushing somewhere, pushing a fat baby in a pink umbrella stroller. There was an African man, too, but judging from his dark angular face and flowing grand boubou, he had to be Senegalese or Burkinabé or from one of the other French-speaking West African countries. "
B0138OAB801,B0138OAB80,"For the first time in much too long, she didn’t wake up in the morning with no plans except to clean the house, go to the market, cook for her parents and siblings, take care of Liomi, meet with her friends and listen to them bash their mothers-in-law, go to bed and look forward to more of the same the next day because her life was going neither forward nor backward. And for the very first time in her life, she had a dream besides marriage and motherhood: to become a pharmacist like the ones everyone respected in Limbe because they handed out health and happiness in pill bottles. To achieve this dream, she had to do well in school, and she was doing just that—maintaining a B-plus average. Three days a week she went to school and, after classes, walked the school’s hallways with her bulky algebra, chemistry, biology, and philosophy textbooks, glowing because she was growing into a learned woman. As often as she could, she sat in the library to do her homework, or went to office hours to hound professors for advice on what she needed to do to get better grades so she could get into a great pharmacy school. She was going to make herself proud, make Jende proud of his wife, make Liomi proud of his mother. She’d waited too long to become something, and now, at thirty-three, she finally had, or was close enough to having, everything she’d ever wanted in life."
B00ZP4KE700,B00ZP4KE70,"She had to whisper it, because Papa would hear no one speak of her dying. Every day he asked if she was recovered enough to walk with him in the gardens. When she couldn’t, he sent slaves to fetch flowers for her bedside. In May, it was yellow jonquil, purple hyacinth, orange lilies, and then red hollyhock. But by early autumn the perfume of crimson dwarf roses couldn’t disguise the fetid scent of sickness in the room.

Since the birth of the baby Mama had borne after we’d returned from the wilderness, Mama had lingered in bed saying she’d never rise up again. Like Papa, I refused to believe her, but

in this moment, she reached for my hand to convince me. My hand had always felt tiny in her palm, but now her hand seemed smaller, fragile.

I turned my head, so she wouldn’t see my fear, and glimpsed the small room that opened at the head of her bed where my father spoke with Dr. Gilmer, who treated Mama and asked no more than to borrow some salt and sugar for his pains. Through all the months of my mother’s illness, Papa was never farther from her than this."
B00ZP4KE701,B00ZP4KE70,"That’s when I first knew my mother had heard enough of revolution and the sacrifice of patriots. Indeed, it seemed to be her singular mission to draw Papa into the delights of simple domestic life. Though the overseer’s cabin was no proper home for a gentleman’s family, Mama set up housekeeping. She had me down on my knees with her, scrubbing at the floorboards with a stiff brush. We hung quilts and beat dust out of them. And when

Papa had to leave to make his forays into the woods, Mama and I saw to it that there was a candle burning in the one window of the cottage to guide him back to us.

A few weeks later, harvest time for the wheat arrived, and Mama sent me with Papa to oversee the slaves toiling in our fields with sharp sickles. The women cut the stalks, beads of sweat running down their bare brown arms. Meanwhile, the shirtless dark-skinned men gathered the cut wheat into bundles, hauling the golden sheaves into the sun to dry.

I loved nothing more than riding atop majestic Caractacus with Papa, and though we were far away from our mountaintop home, it almost made me feel everything was just the way it should be."
B018ER7K5I0,B018ER7K5I,"Mounted inside the door of the cupboard over the double-basin sink was a large varnished board in the shape of a key— one of Stan’s clients had made it in his workshop and given it to him two Christmases ago. The key-board was studded with small hooks, and swinging on these were all the keys the house took, two duplicates of each to a hook. Beneath each hook was a strip of Mystik tape, each strip lettered in Stan’s small, neat printing: GARAGE, ATTIC, D’STAIRS BATH, UPSTAIRS BATH, FRONT DOOR, BACK DOOR. Off to one side were ignition-key dupes labelled M-B and VOLVO.

Patty snatched the key marked UPSTAIRS BATH, began to run for the stairs, and then made herself walk. Running made the panic want to come back, and the panic was too close to the surface as it was. Also, if she just walked, maybe nothing would be wrong. Or, if there was something wrong, God could look down, see she was just walking, and think: Oh, good—I pulled a hell of a boner, but I’ve got time to take it all back.

Walking as sedately as a woman on her way to a Ladies’ Book Circle meeting, she went up the stairs and down to the closed bathroom door."
B018ER7K5I1,B018ER7K5I,"She stood there, perfectly still, a pale statue with a pulse beating in its throat.

Now she could remember running back down here, feet stuttering on the stair-levels, running for the phone, oh yes, oh sure, but who had she meant to call?

Crazily, she thought: I would call the turtle, but the turtle couldn’t help us.

It didn’t matter anyway. She had gotten as far as 0 and she must have said something not quite standard, because the operator had asked if she had a problem. She had one, all right, but how did you tell that faceless voice that Stanley had locked himself in the bathroom and didn’t answer her, that the steady sound of the water dripping into the tub was killing her heart? Someone had to help her. Someone—

She put the back of her hand into her mouth and deliberately bit down on it. She tried to think, tried to force herself to think.

The spare keys. The spare keys in the kitchen cupboard.

She got going, and one slippered foot kicked the bag of buttons resting beside her chair. Some of the buttons spilled out, glittering like glazed eyes in the lamplight. She saw at least half a dozen black ones."
B06Y55SB480,B06Y55SB48,"The room buzzed with activity. I slid my way between workers who efficiently glided to and fro. In town, you have to walk slowly or you’ll knock over tourists. But the port is for professionals only. We all know the Artemis Longstep and can get a good head of steam going.

At the north side of the port, a few commuters waited near the train airlock. Most were headed to the city reactors and Sanchez Aluminum’s smelter, a kilometer south of town. The smelter uses insane amounts of heat and extremely nasty chemicals, so everyone agrees it should be far away. As for the reactors…well…they’re nuclear reactors. We like those far away too.

Dale slithered over to the train platform. He’d be going to the Apollo 11 Visitor Center. Tourists love it. The half-hour train ride provides stunning views of the moon’s terrain, and the Visitor Center is a great place to look at the landing site without ever leaving pressure. And for those who do want to venture outside to get a better view, Dale and other EVA masters are ready to give them a tour.

Just in front of the train airlock there was a huge Kenyan flag. "
B06Y55SB481,B06Y55SB48,"If you have to ask, you can’t afford it. The Ritz-Carlton Artemis occupies an entire block and extends five floors up and another five down. A single night there costs 12,000 slugs— more than I make in a month as a porter (though I have other sources of income).

Despite the costs of a lunar vacation, demand always exceeds supply. Middle-class Earthers can afford it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience with suitable financing. They stay at crappier hotels in crappier bubbles like Conrad. But wealthy folks make annual trips and stay in nice hotels. And my, oh my, do they shop.

More than anywhere else, Aldrin is where money enters Artemis.

There was nothing in the shopping district I could afford. But someday, I’d have enough to belong there. That was my plan, anyway. I took one more long look, then turned away and headed to the Port of Entry.

Aldrin is the closest bubble to the landing zone. Wouldn’t want rich people dirtying themselves by traveling through impoverished areas, right? Bring them straight into the pretty part.

I strolled through the large archway into the port. The massive airlock complex is the second-largest chamber in the city. (Only Aldrin Park is larger.) "
B07BPPLZ1L0,B07BPPLZ1L,"Yeah, sure, I could have used the voice commands or whatever, but part of me was going to feel stupid using them if it wasn’t life or death. Besides, if another Pen Bearer was watching, I didn’t want to give away my ace in the hole just yet.

Nodding to myself, I made my way toward the front of the casino so I could catch a ride. The Medallion was nice, sure, but it was no Emperor’s Palace or whatever. Actually, for all I knew, it was . Honestly, I just wanted to go to Emperor’s Palace and see the statues move around.

As I made my way toward the taxi pickup, I found a line of people and frowned. Part of me wanted to avoid the line and just use my pen to make a limo show up, but as I moved toward the line, I realized I didn’t want to be driven. No, I wanted to walk.

Taking another gulp of air, I decided to do just that. After all, catching a taxi, a limo, or a fucking helicopter filled with swimsuit models was just a flick of the wrist away.

Spinning on my heel, I began to walk back up toward the street when my heightened senses picked up the sound of someone shuffling behind me. "
B07BPPLZ1L1,B07BPPLZ1L,"I took a deep breath and concentrated as I tried to disentangle myself from a bed full of six naked women while also not waking any of them. Only as I rose from the massive bed to head to the shower, I heard Amy moan and saw her eyes starting to flutter. I froze, mid-step, one foot on the cool tile of my room and the other still trapped beneath the satin sheets.

She made a weird sort of cooing moan before smacking her lips together. She rolled over, away from where I’d been lying beneath her arm, and threw her arm over Maggie. Her movement caused her to draw the sheet down just enough that I got a spectacular view of Maggie’s well-endowed chest, and for half a second, I thought about waking them up, and well, you know.

I didn’t, but that was only because I was in desperate need of a shower after six hours of sex. Now free of the bed and satisfied none of them would awaken, I made my way across the large room and headed toward the door.

We were in the Las Vegas lair below the Medallion casino, but that was only because we hadn’t figured out where we wanted to go yet. "

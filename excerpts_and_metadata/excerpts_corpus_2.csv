B079KSSGBJ0,B079KSSGBJ,"He takes the hint and stops trying to engage me in bullshit, pointless small talk. Both of us remain silent the rest of the drive until we pull into the parking lot behind the bar. We get out and walk inside. I’m impressed to see that not much has changed, and it’s still the quiet little place that I remember. It’s located on the far side of town, so not many people know about it. Especially since there’s been a big influx of trendy bars closer to the city. Little places like this had been overlooked, and although it sucked for them from a business sense, it suited me down to the ground. I hate crowds almost as much as I hate socializing.

We find ourselves a table. I order a scotch while Josh orders a beer. Catch-ups like this used to be a regular thing and something that I looked forward to, but they haven’t happened in a long time. We used to hit this very place nearly every weekend, but that was before life and work became more important than family. Before everything went to shit with Casey.

A break-up is messy enough, but when your brother falls in love with your wife, it jumps to a whole new level of complicated."
B079KSSGBJ1,B079KSSGBJ,"Hearing her say those things about me in her office, listening to her talk about my cock like that, made me hard as fuck. I’d gotten nothing done all day because all I could think about was her. And just now, the way she stood up to me? Major turn-on.

I am so sick of women telling me what they think I want to hear and then just falling to their knees, ready to do whatever I ask of them. That had been Jade in a nutshell. Her second day here, her mouth was on the end of my cock, whether I wanted it or not. It was fine for a while, but I got bored like I always do. I needed a challenge. Something to distract me, someone, where there’s no risk of feelings developing, because inevitably, that’s what always ruins things for me. My requirements definitely were not something that any woman I associated with could satisfy. Hell, I wasn’t even sure Alana was up to the challenge, but at least she showed potential.

I block all thoughts of everything except Alana out of my head as my orgasm builds. I groan, stroking my cock, while my other hand wraps around the edge of the desk. I lever myself forward, my throat constricting as I come."
B0180T0IUY0,B0180T0IUY,"It will be good to be home again. I’m thinking of starting up the gas logs. We’ve never had a fire before Halloween, but tonight is so unseasonably cold that after walking a mile in this wind, all I want is to sit by the hearth with Daniela and Charlie and a glass of wine.

The street undercuts the El.

I pass beneath the rusting ironwork of the railway.

For me, even more than the skyline, the El personifies the city.

This is my favorite section of the walk home, because it’s the darkest and quietest.

At the moment…

No trains inbound.

No headlights in either direction.

No audible pub noise.

Nothing but the distant roar of a jet overhead, on final approach into O’Hare.

Wait…

There’s something coming—footfalls on the sidewalk.

I glance back.

A shadow rushes toward me, the distance between us closing faster than I can process what’s happening.

The first thing I see is a face.

Ghost white.

High, arching eyebrows that look drawn.

Red, pursed lips—too thin, too perfect.

And horrifying eyes—big and pitch-black, without pupils or irises.

The second thing I see is the barrel of a gun, four inches from the end of my nose."
B0180T0IUY1,B0180T0IUY,"I pass a construction site, abandoned for the night, and a few blocks later, the playground of the elementary school my son attended, the metal sliding board gleaming under a streetlamp and the swings stirring in the breeze.

There’s an energy to these autumn nights that touches something primal inside of me. Something from long ago. From my childhood in western Iowa. I think of high school football games and the stadium lights blazing down on the players. I smell ripening apples, and the sour reek of beer from keg parties in the cornfields. I feel the wind in my face as I ride in the bed of an old pickup truck down a country road at night, dust swirling red in the taillights and the entire span of my life yawning out ahead of me.

It’s the beautiful thing about youth.

There’s a weightlessness that permeates everything because no damning choices have been made, no paths committed to, and the road forking out ahead is pure, unlimited potential.

I love my life, but I haven’t felt that lightness of being in ages. Autumn nights like this are as close as I get.

The cold is beginning to clear my head."
B01M7XPCYE0,B01M7XPCYE,"For learning once more what you’d already learned, sitting all afternoon and into the night alone on the curb, waiting for your father’s headlights that never came, or believing your mom would stick to her promise and stay sober through your high school awards dinner. The truth was that there was no end to the people you could not count on. Safer, then, to trust no one.

But the kid’s curls were tumbling over big, innocent eyes. And he’d have to leave soon for his bus.

Slowly, watching his face for signs of boredom —people could lose interest in you any moment — Kate plucked out two old Polaroids from her back jeans pocket. One of these was the photo that had started her down this road—quite literally—to ending up here in Charleston today, the photo that she’d adapted for her presentation, then let herself be overwhelmed by midlecture.

The boy peered over her arm. The first photo showed her mother in the long, flowing satin beside the live oaks. More than anything, those ropes of dangling moss gave the scene an otherworldly quality, as if the young woman with the distant expression had only floated there for an instant—had no real tie to that moment or to the man holding the camera. In the second photo, Sarah Grace, this time in cutoff jean shorts, sat on top of a massive white pediment, like some historic site, high above the ground."
B01M7XPCYE1,B01M7XPCYE,"Kate could see her mother beside her, the two of them kneeling in the surf as it dropped away from high tide, Kate’s short, chubby legs covered in sand. And there, Sarah Grace was saying, is one worth adding to our collection: a knobbed whelk. How clever of you to find it. And here, this stripy one is a lightning whelk. See the difference?

That must have been on the Isle of Palms, just off the coast here, where they’d sometimes walked as a young family. And later, after she and her mother had fled whatever it was they had fled, Kate had sat on the cold linoleum floor of their duplex with the starfish and sand dollars and scallops and oyster shells all mounded around her, clutching a conch to her chest and sobbing, I want to go home! Why can’t we go home?

And then the seashell collection had disappeared entirely. Like everything else—without explanations that made any sense.

Because it makes you cry, Katie, her mother had said. My poor, sweet little Kate. It makes us want to go back.

She’d hugged Kate so tightly then that her chest hurt. I’m so sorry, my Katie. So sorry, she’d cried. But, please. No questions. For your momma’s sake."
B07576D9M80,B07576D9M8,"One of my ancestors had given it to me for my birthday, in case I one day chose to take up the mantle of Horseman of the Apocalypse. The Fifth Horseman.

I had chosen to actually wear it only one time. And no one who had been there wanted to talk about it. My friends had tried to get me to show them, but I had stubbornly refused. After seeing the horrified reactions of those who had seen it on me, I had decided I wouldn’t be able to handle my friends looking at me with that same level of fear.

I hadn’t asked for the Mask, or the offer to join the A-Team, because I was generally opposed to anything Apocalyptic-y …

But the Four Horsemen – Death, War, Pestilence, and Famine, as they were most notably known – seemed eager for me to mount up beside them. They also told me that I might be able to use the Mask a handful of times – they weren’t sure exactly how many times – before I would be forced to make a choice: to remain as I was, or to ride at their side in the End Days.

As the Horseman of Hope.

I shivered."
B07576D9M81,B07576D9M8,"Hugin and Munin flew up into the air, since the space was easily fifty feet high, and settled on one of the bannisters on the third of the five balconied tiers that contained row upon row of books and other bric-a-brac that made up my Sanctorum – a centuries-old depository of knowledge built by an unknown ancestor of mine. The ravens stared down at us as if watching a science experiment, or maybe recording details for Odin. I shivered at that, and then let my eyes drift past a noticeable open space near a large waterfall to my left. A magical round table rose up from the floor if I walked too close, and I had obvious questions about its origins. Fanboy questions. The space smelled of fresh mist and old books, and power hummed in the air.

Pan and Gunnar finally noticed me, and then shared a significant look. Gunnar jogged my way, dropping the ball as he approached. He stopped before me, leveling me with a glare, and then pulled out his phone to shove it in my face. It was his social media newsfeed, and it showed a picture of my selfie with Hercules.

I grinned, nodding. Gunnar’s one-eyed glare – because he had misplaced the other eye in a fight against the Brothers Grimm – tightened. Then he pointed at the number of likes. I squinted down, and blinked."
B071HY4RMC0,B071HY4RMC,"Jan’s father was at work and he could see the bent form of his mother, pulling vegetables from the garden, her back turned away. He mouthed to the others to be quiet as he and Nico slid in through the side door. Lex was told to tuck himself under the front window and keep watch.

Jan needn’t have worried about Oscar. He wasn’t in, though he might have turned up any minute. Jan whispered to Nico to keep an eye on his mother through the kitchen window, while he rummaged in the pantry for food. There was a newly baked loaf of bread and a potato pie, ready for supper, but it would be too obvious if he took either of those. He carved a slice of ham from yesterday’s joint and wrapped it in a scrap of greaseproof paper, then took two apples from the top crate and a few biscuits from the tin on the sideboard. Nigel would probably be thirsty but Jan didn’t know how to make coffee and anyway it would make a smell that would arouse suspicion. In the back of the cupboard where his mother kept the crockery he found a glass bottle and filled it with water from the tap. He was packing it all into a cloth bag when Nico suddenly dived onto the floor."
B071HY4RMC1,B071HY4RMC,"Jan whistled to himself as he skipped along the path framed by enormous beech trees, just coming into leaf in the warm sunshine. He knew the path well, the patch of bilberries the three of them would raid later that summer as soon as the tiny green berries turned purple and sweet and the big rock covered in moss where they took a sharp right. There was no path here but the boys used the rock as a marker, before plunging into the leafy undergrowth till they were hidden from the path. After a few yards, Jan came to the gnarled oak tree and resisted the temptation to climb to the upper branches. It was more fun doing that when the others were there.

Where were they, he thought impatiently, and began scuffing his feet through the dead leaves that always covered the woodland floor. Straight ahead, the trees thinned to reveal a clearing surrounded by some straggly bushes. Jan dropped to his knees and began crawling through, knowing he was completely hidden should anyone come up behind him. He’d sometimes bring his father’s garden scissors when the branches and twigs became so entangled that they scratched their arms and legs. They definitely needed a trim now, he thought, stopping to suck his stinging hand."
B004RD856M0,B004RD856M,"Like he was staring wilderness itself straight in the eye.

He faced forward in the wagon, shook the reins, and let the horse gather to a trot, both of them eager to put the fox behind them. For the next hour, he rode hunched and cold as the wagon bumped along through miles of untouched forest. As he neared town, the horse picked up its pace, and Jack had to slow it to keep the crate from spilling out of the wagon.

Back home, Alpine wouldn’t have been called a town at all. It was nothing more than a few dusty, false-fronted buildings perched between the train tracks and the Wolverine River. Nearby, several homesteaders had stripped the land clear of trees before abandoning it. Some went off to pan gold or work for the railroad, but most had hightailed it home with no plans of ever returning to Alaska.

Jack carried the crate of pies up the steps to the hotel restaurant, where the owner’s wife opened the door for him. Well into her sixties, Betty wore her hair short and mannish and ran the place like a one-woman show. Her husband, Roy, worked for the territorial government and was rarely about."
B004RD856M1,B004RD856M,"He wondered not for the first time if wild animals could give that feeling. Dumb beasts, like cows and chickens, could stare at a man’s back all day and not give a prickle on his neck. But maybe woodland creatures were different. He tried to picture a bear shuffling through the forest, pacing back and forth and eyeing him and the horse. Didn’t seem likely, getting this close to winter. They should be looking to den up.

His eyes caught now and then on a stump or a shadowy spot among the trees. Shrug it off, old man, he told himself. You’ll drive yourself crazy looking for something that’s not there.

He went to shake the reins, but then peered one last time over his shoulder and saw it—a flash of movement, a smudge of brownish red. The horse snorted. Jack turned slowly in the wagon seat.

A red fox darted among the fallen trees. It disappeared for a minute but popped up again, closer to the forest, running with its fluffy tail held low to the ground. It stopped and turned its head. For a moment its eyes locked with Jack’s, and there, in its narrowing golden irises, he saw the savagery of the place."
B076VBYNBS0,B076VBYNBS,"Mikey’s thirtieth birthday came and went, with a text from Alice and a generic card from HR in his work mailbox, the typeface meant to resemble actual handwriting, acknowledging him as a valued employee and wishing him a special day.

It was a week after Mikey’s birthday that he received word of Sally’s death.

The news came from a colleague, someone who had attended Mikey’s high school but who was several years younger than Mikey. The colleague had not known Sally, but news of a former student’s suicide had reached him through the local news. Her body was found in the Buffalo River, less than a quarter mile downstream from the Buffalo Skyway. Her car was parked just off the entrance to the Skyway, an elevated steel bridge that soared one hundred feet over the water beneath. Her mother had reported her missing late the night before. Although there was no note, it appeared to be a straightforward suicide. Her mother confirmed her struggle with depression. Video surveillance from the bridge showed that she acted alone, just after midnight. Mikey’s colleague realized that Sally would have been about Mikey’s age, and he asked Mikey about it at work, wondering if Mikey had heard the news about his classmate, wondering if Mikey had known or would even remember the girl. Her name was Sally, the guy said to Mikey. Did you know a Sally?"
B076VBYNBS1,B076VBYNBS,"He couldn’t bring himself to start social media accounts because he hated all photographs of himself: left eye always a bit creamy and strange and faraway, right eye focused but never quite meeting the camera’s lens, as though he feared its judgment. Cheeks always flaming, freckles overlaid with red. Cowlick always wild, as if it had an ax to grind.

Mikey therefore always read the emails from The Gunners with great interest, and felt deeply invested in their lives. He went on soaring Google Earth explorations through their towns, zooming around parks and downtowns and up and down residential streets. He made a habit of sending birthday cards—actual cards, via snail mail—to the others, who always expressed incredulous gratitude for the gesture.

Mikey did not tell his friends that he might be going blind and was mining childhood relics, yearbooks and journals and stacks of Polaroid photographs rubber-banded together, searching for pictures of his friends and meditating on them, knowing that these dear faces might one day elude him.

In early January, the city of Buffalo was fossilized beneath three feet of hard gray snow, the air bitterly cold and humid. People moved slowly, like cogs in an old machine, muscles hard, cold licking at their faces. Pipes had burst at General Mills, and Mikey was working twelve-hour days."
B071K66WHB0,B071K66WHB,"I was hoping today I could do something more suave. We had lunch Monday and Tuesday but I still couldn’t bring myself to make a move. I know she loves the bakery down in Tribeca, so I took two subways to get her the pineapple muffin she’s always talking about. It’s her favorite, and she never takes the time to eat breakfast.

My plan for romancing her this morning didn’t go so well, so maybe I can try again at lunch. I decide to work as much as I can before then to distract myself from the epic swing-and-a-miss.

In our security department, I run the background checks for all employees and potential employees. If you’re interviewing with us, I’m the one who gets an extensive look into your past and then decides if you’d be a good fit. I also randomly research existing employees to make sure things are still copacetic. A few years ago, I found out that someone in finance had racked up a ton of debt and was slowly stealing from the company. It was only a few hundred dollars at the time, but they were well on their way to a bigger slice of pie."

Okay you’ve officially made my day and it’s only 9 a.m. You get the biggest gold star out of everyone on my list. Pineapple muffin? It’s like you’re psychic.

Soups are on me at noon. Be there or be square.

I reply back with a gif of Yoda giving her a thumbs-up, then immediately regret it. I put my face in my hands and rub my eyes, wondering why I’m an idiot. No wonder she doesn’t see me as anything more than a friend."
B07289YG430,B07289YG43,"And what’s more, Magnolia has the dirt on just about all of them, or so she claimed on the night when we celebrated me taking the helm of Seven Sinners.

As I slip out of my car and shut the door, careful not to ding the Porsche parked beside it, my breathing speeds up. Magnolia won’t pull punches. She’ll tell me just how screwed I am.

I cross the pristine parking garage floor to the elevator and press the call button. It appears instantly, and within moments, I’m standing in front of the entrance to her sixth-floor condo. She hasn’t quite reached penthouse status, but I have no doubt she’s heading there. Magnolia has as much entrepreneurial spirit running through her veins as I do, if not more.

Maybe that’s part of the reason we’re kindred spirits. We’re both in the business of sin.

She opens the door on my first knock, and her peach silk dressing gown emphasizes her every gorgeous curve. Instead of the normal smile I usually get when I show up, she grabs me by the arm and yanks me inside. She slams the door behind me and locks the dead bolt.

I face her, a lump growing in my throat."
B07289YG431,B07289YG43,"The smile that tugs at the corners of my mouth isn’t forced. It’s pride. I will make my father proud. I took a risk by changing grain suppliers—without telling him, I might add— and it’s going to pay off huge.

If I can keep the distillery open long enough to bring it to fruition.

All night, I worked through scenarios. When I signed the loans with the bank, it was all based on the assumption that every loan was already disclosed. I didn’t know about the debt to Mount. How could I disclose it? And if it wasn’t filed with the state and on record, then it doesn’t count, right? Or could he be second tier and force a foreclosure to get what he’s owed, after the original lenders are paid off? It’s not like I know the ins and outs of any of this stuff, and what’s more , I assume it doesn’t matter. I can’t imagine Lachlan Mount abides by the normal rules that apply to everyone else.

There’s only one person I know who might be able to give me some insight. And since Google failed me, she’s my next best option. No general makes decisions without information."
B00348UN3Y0,B00348UN3Y,"Since his taste ran to politics, the golden opportunity had not so far offered itself, the Marquis not sharing his ambition, and consequently making infrequent appearances in the Upper House; but he was allowed to write such brief speeches as his patron felt that it behoved him to utter, and even, now and then, to favour him with his own political convictions.

Furthermore, he had found it quite impossible to dislike Alverstoke. While he was given no reason to suppose that Alverstoke was interested in his concerns, he found him to be as unexacting as he was amiable, and never disagreeably high in the instep. Comparing notes with a college-friend, in a similar situation, whose employer appeared to regard him as a cross between a black slave and an upper servant, Charles knew himself to be fortunate. Alverstoke could give an annihilating snub to some encroaching mushroom, but if his secretary erred he raked him down in a manner which was unexceptionable, since it conveyed no suggestion of social superiority. Charles’s friend had curt commands flung at him; Charles received civil requests, generally accompanied by one of his lordship’s more attractive smiles. Try as Charles would, he could not resist Alverstoke’s charm, any more than he could withhold admiration for his horsemanship, and his proficiency in a great many sporting activities."
B00348UN3Y1,B00348UN3Y,"A comfortable living was not his only reward: his noble pupil remained sincerely attached to him; stood as godfather to his eldest son; and reared his own son in the vague belief that the Reverend Laurence Trevor had a claim upon his patronage.

So, when the Reverend Laurence had ventured to suggest to the present Marquis that Charles was a suitable candidate for the post of secretary, Alverstoke had accepted him with far more readiness than Charles had felt in becoming a member of his household. Charles had no desire to enter the Church, but he was a young man of serious mind and unimpeachable morals, and nothing he had heard of Alverstoke led him to expect that his appointment would prove to be anything but a mortification of the flesh. But as he had, besides commonsense, a good deal of filial affection, and knew that to a clergyman of moderate substance it was no easy task to provide for a sixth son, he kept his misgivings to himself, assured his father that he would do his best not to disappoint his expectations, and derived what consolation he could from the reflection that when he was an inmate of Alverstoke House he must surely find it easier to discover and to grasp a golden opportunity than while he kicked his heels in a country parsonage."
B001QKSWOE0,B001QKSWOE,"My apartment consists of a small entrance foyer with hooks on the wall for coats and hats and handbags. The kitchen and living room open off the foyer, a dining area is tucked into an extension of the living room, and at the other end is a short hallway leading to my bedroom and bathroom. My décor is mostly whatever was discarded by relatives. This is okay by me because Aunt Betty’s chair, Grandma Mazur’s dining room set, and my cousin Tootsie’s coffee table are comfortable. They come to me infused with family history, and they give off a kind of gentle energy that my life is sometimes lacking. Not to mention, I can’t afford anything else.

I hung my tote on one of the hooks in the foyer and stared down at a pair of scruffy men’s boots that had been kicked off and left in the middle of the floor. I was pretty sure I recognized the boots, plus the battered leather backpack that had been dumped on Tootie’s coffee table.

I walked into the living room and stared down at the backpack. I blew out a sigh and rolled my eyes. Why me? I thought. Isn’t it enough that I have a monkey? Do I really need one more complication?"

There are a couple men in my life who tempt me . . . just not with marriage.

One of those tempting men is Joe Morelli. He’s a Trenton cop with bedroom eyes, and bedroom hands, and everything else you’d want to find in your bedroom is top of the line. He’s been my off-again, on-again boyfriend for as long as I can remember, and last night he was on-again.

The second guy in my life is Carlos Manoso, aka Ranger. Ranger’s been my mentor, my employer, my guardian angel, and he’s gotten as intimate with me as a man can get, but Ranger has never totally qualified as a boyfriend. Boyfriend might suggest an occasional date, and I can’t see Ranger going there. Ranger is the sort of guy who slips uninvited into a girl’s dreams and desires and refuses to leave."
B010ZXKCJU0,B010ZXKCJU,"Within a week, Jasper had made three more visits to Liz’s apartment and in two cases slept over; patterns had been established. The drawbacks to this version of a relationship were so glaringly obvious—because members of Susan’s extended family loyal to her grandmother lived in Manhattan, discretion was necessary, and Liz and Jasper therefore didn’t dine together in restaurants, nor were they each other’s dates for work-related functions—that they hardly seemed worth dwelling on. On the other hand, she was able to enjoy genuine closeness, as well as physical intimacy, with someone she knew well and cared for deeply, while still having time to work and run and read and see friends—perhaps, in fact, more time than when she’d been scouring dating websites or spending three hours at a stretch analyzing her singleness with Jane or other women. A few friends knew about Jasper, as did her older sister, and their skeptical reactions were for Liz sufficient deterrent to discuss the unusual arrangement further; it was too easy for it to sound like Jasper was doing nothing more than cheating.

One Friday evening in late May, two years into Liz’s reconciliation with Jasper, Liz was at Jane’s apartment; Jane chopped kale for a salad while Liz opened the bottle of red wine she’d brought."
B010ZXKCJU1,B010ZXKCJU,"At points during their five-year silence, Liz had indulged in the fantasy that Jasper would show up at her office or apartment—possibly, as in a movie, having run through the rain—to urgently declare his love. He might even, in such scenarios, have said, It was always you. But he would not have still been legally wed to Susan; certainly, he would not be the father of a nineteen-month-old. And yet, through the shimmery softness of the three gins she’d consumed, Liz thought that these compromising circumstances gave the situation a certain credibility: It wasn’t too good to be true. She didn’t need to feel unsettled by getting everything she’d always hoped for.

Back at her apartment, the consummation of their whatever-it-was also was not a dream come true—certainly fourteen years of buildup and more than a half dozen cocktails between them didn’t help matters — but it was adequate, and afterward, when Jasper fell asleep holding her, she wished that her twenty-two-year-old self could know that it would, in the end, happen for them. Her twenty-two-year-old self might have been less charmed when Jasper woke up forty minutes later, took a hasty shower, and hurried home to his wife and child; despite Jasper and Susan’s conjugal agreement, it was Jasper’s turn the next morning to get up with Aidan at five A.M."
B00AXIZ4TQ0,B00AXIZ4TQ,"The elevator lurched to a stop, and Dr. Brooks yanked open the folding door. They were walking again, this time down a dark, narrow corridor. They passed a window, outside of which the murky silhouettes of Florence rooftops had begun emerging in the predawn light. At the far end of the hall, she crouched down and retrieved a key from beneath a thirsty-looking houseplant and unlocked a door.

The apartment was tiny, the air inside hinting at an ongoing battle between a vanilla-scented candle and old carpeting. The furniture and artwork were meager at best—as if she had furnished it at a yard sale. Dr. Brooks adjusted a thermostat, and the radiators banged to life.

She stood a moment and closed her eyes, exhaling heavily, as if to collect herself. Then she turned and helped Langdon into a modest kitchenette whose Formica table had two flimsy chairs.

Langdon made a move toward a chair in hopes of sitting down, but Dr. Brooks grabbed his arm with one hand and opened a cabinet with her other. The cabinet was nearly bare … crackers, a few bags of pasta, a can of Coke, and a bottle of NoDoz.

She took out the bottle and dumped six caplets into Langdon’s palm."
B00AXIZ4TQ1,B00AXIZ4TQ,"Don’t look.

He leaned on the wall, trying to catch his breath. His forearm ached, and when he looked down, he saw that the sleeve of his Harris Tweed had been tied awkwardly around his arm like a bandage. The remainder of the jacket was dragging behind him on the ground, frayed and filthy.

He closed his eyes against his pounding headache, but the blackness engulfed him again.

A familiar vision materialized—the statuesque, veiled woman with the amulet and silver hair in ringlets. As before, she was on the banks of a bloodred river and surrounded by writhing bodies. She spoke to Langdon, her voice pleading. Seek and ye shall find!

Langdon was overcome with the feeling that he had to save her … save them all. The half-buried, upside-down legs were falling limp … one by one.

Who are you!? he called out in silence. What do you want?!

Her luxuriant silver hair began fluttering in a hot wind. Our time grows short, she whispered, touching her amulet necklace. Then, without warning, she erupted in a blinding pillar of fire, which billowed across the river, engulfing them both.

Langdon shouted, his eyes flying open.

Dr. Brooks eyed him with concern."
B01A4B1PEE0,B01A4B1PEE,"And the thing he tries to hold in his mind in this near-comatose state is the memory of himself dancing.

He wants to remember what that felt like: a moment of transcendent joy. He had defeated the dragon for the first time. His Chicago friends all cheered.

But now it won’t come to him, the feeling that made him dance so exuberantly. Pwnage tries to imagine himself doing it, but it feels detached— it has the quality of something he saw on television, long ago. The way he feels now, it couldn’t have been him churning the butter, starting the lawn mower, spanking that ass.

Tomorrow, he vows.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the new diet—the real, official first day. And maybe today was actually a warm-up or dry run or head start for the actual first day of the new diet, which would be very soon. One of these days very soon when he would wake up early and eat a healthy breakfast and get working on the kitchen and clean the cabinets and buy some groceries and avoid the computer and finally, for an entire day, do everything exactly, perfectly right.

He swears. He promises. One of these days will be the day that changes everything."
B01A4B1PEE1,B01A4B1PEE,"—and his mind begins to glaze over within the first fifteen minutes, at the point the protagonist figures out the secret the government’s been keeping all this time and now knows there’s some seriously heavy shit about to go down, Pwnage zones out and reflects on his day, remembers vaguely his eager and intense desire that very afternoon to start eating better, and maybe because he feels guilty that he did not, in fact, find it the right day to start eating better, he cracks open another Brazil nut, figuring maybe it’s best to kind of ease into these things, that the Brazil nut is a bridge between his current life and the eating-better life that is ahead of him, and he spaces out and stares at the television with an empty fishlike quality in his eyes and swallows the thick Brazil nut bolus and watches as the earth is destroyed and he sort of happily imagines a rock the size of California falling into the earth and in a skeleton-melting flash wiping out everything, killing everyone, annihilating it all, and he rises from the couch, and it’s almost dawn, and he wonders where the night went, and he stumbles into his bedroom and sees himself in the mirror —"

TITUBA, already taking a step backward: My Betty be hearty soon?

PARRIS: Out of here!

TITUBA, backing to the door: My Betty not goin’ die . . .

PARRIS, scrambling to his feet in a fury: Out of my sight! She is gone. Out of my— He is overcome with sobs. He clamps his teeth against them and closes the door and leans against it, exhausted. Oh, my God! God help me! Quaking with fear, mumbling to himself through his sobs, he goes to the bed and gently takes Betty’s hand. Betty. Child. Dear child. Will you wake, will you open up your eyes! Betty, little one . . .

He is bending to kneel again when his niece, Abigail Williams, seventeen, enters—a strikingly beautiful girl, an orphan, with an endless capacity for dissembling. Now she is all worry and apprehension and propriety.

ABIGAIL: Uncle? He looks to her. Susanna Walcott’s here from Doctor Griggs.

PARRIS: Oh? Let her come, let her come.

ABIGAIL, leaning out the door to call to Susanna, who is down the hall a few steps: Come in, Susanna."
B00WDP54AQ1,B00WDP54AQ,"Simply, it was this: for good purposes, even high purposes, the people of Salem developed a theocracy, a combine of state and religious power whose function was to keep the community together, and to prevent any kind of disunity that might open it to destruction by material or ideological enemies. It was forged for a necessary purpose and accomplished that purpose. But all organization is and must be grounded on the idea of exclusion and prohibition, just as two objects cannot occupy the same space. Evidently the time came in New England when the repressions of order were heavier than seemed warranted by the dangers against which the order was organized. The witch-hunt was a perverse manifestation of the panic which set in among all classes when the balance began to turn toward greater individual freedom.

When one rises above the individual villainy displayed, one can only pity them all, just as we shall be pitied someday. It is still impossible for man to organize his social life without repressions, and the balance has yet to be struck between order and freedom.

The witch-hunt was not, however, a mere repression. It was also, and as importantly, a long overdue opportunity for everyone so inclined to express publicly his guilt and sins, under the cover of accusations against the victims."
B01GONIFLM0,B01GONIFLM,"She saw a different kind of life and was enchanted. Her hopes were raised. At home, the milk in a bottle, the marge in a tub, the sugar in a bag, and the tea in a mug were all stones in her pockets, weighing her down. At seventeen she had fallen into the space between the two worlds and there was nowhere left she truly belonged. And then she met Vince.

He was older; handsome, cocksure, and ambitious. She was flattered by his attentions and impressed by his certainty. Vince was certain about everything. He even had a nickname for himself; Vince the Invincible. He was a car dealer and drove a red Jaguar E-Type; a cliché on wheels. Laura’s parents were quietly distraught. They had hoped that her education would be the key to a better life for her; better than theirs. A life with more living and less struggling. They may not have

understood about tray cloths, but they knew that the kind of life they wished for Laura was about more than just money. For Laura, it was never about the money. For Vince the Invincible, it was only ever about money and status. Laura’s father soon had his own private nickname for Vince Darby. VD."
B01GONIFLM1,B01GONIFLM,"At seventeen she was still vulnerable, unformed; unsure of her own worth. She was happy at school, but the scholarship meant that she was always slightly displaced. Her factory-worker father and shop-assistant mother were so proud of their clever daughter. Money was found—scraped together—for every item of her expensive school uniform to be bought; unheard of unnecessaries like indoor and outdoor shoes. Everything had to be new. Nothing secondhand for their girl, and she was grateful, truly she was. She knew only too well the sacrifices that her parents had made. But it wasn’t enough. Being bright and beautifully presented was never quite enough for her to slip seamlessly into the society of those who formed the rank and file of the school’s assembly. Girls for whom holidays abroad, trips to the theater, supper parties, and sailing weekends were commonplace. Of course she made friends, girls who were kind and generous, and she accepted their invitations to stay at grand houses with their kind and generous parents. Grand houses where tea was served in pots, toast in racks, butter in dishes, milk in jugs, and jam with a silver spoon. Houses with names instead of numbers that had terraces, tennis courts, and topiary. And tray cloths."
B078H6B2D30,B078H6B2D3,"After all, that sweet face and banging body desperately needed corrupting. He’d do a damn good job of it, too—even better if he could get a bead on her.

As a cop, then a PI, he could usually size people up in two minutes. But so far, Heavenly didn’t fit into any of his neat mental categories. She’d yielded to Beck like a natural submissive, but this girl had fortitude he could feel. Seth wanted to strip her down, learn her. The instinct jolted him as if he’d shoved his tongue into a light socket.

What the hell? He’d done the relationship thing once—a lifetime ago. Now he stuck to flings, club sex, and one-night stands, giving zero fucks about anything except mutual pleasure.

Why should Heavenly be different?

Before she could leave, Beck cupped her elbow, staying her. Fury burst inside Seth at the sight of another man’s hands on her.

Now he was jealous? What the fuck… Heavenly hardly belonged to him, and he’d bonded with the fair but firm Dom last week when Liam and Hammer had asked them to give a confused Raine guidance. So why the urge to break every one of the sadistic surgeon’s fingers?"
B078H6B2D31,B078H6B2D3,"In the hospital bed, Raine shifted and moaned. Shit, the woman had fought for her life this morning. He shouldn’t be thinking about what was going on behind his zipper. He’d come from New York to help Liam with Raine. His sex life would wait.

Cup outstretched, Heavenly approached Raine on his right, then she sent a questioning glance Beck’s way. Asking him for permission? Granted, she sought to help a patient and Beck was the medical expert, but Seth didn’t like her submitting in any way to the sadist.

Did she, outside the hospital? He would have sworn Heavenly had good girl written all over her…but he sensed something between those two.

The idea of this sweet thing bending to Beck’s will and begging for his pain made Seth surly. Ridiculous since he’d met this woman ten minutes ago, and they’d exchanged a handful of words. She didn’t mean anything. Hell, none of the girls he banged did. And he’d never want Beck’s leftovers. But neither logic nor the mental caution tape stopped the instant flare of Seth’s primal instincts.

When Beck nodded his approval, Heavenly set the plastic cup on the nearby tray and smiled at her patient."
B0142BVMF40,B0142BVMF4,"Some years ago, one of the merchants gave Kilian a new leather book with fine blank parchment paper in thanks for nursing his favorite horse back to health. Madlen’s brother treated that book like a priceless treasure. Once, he had shown his sister his painstakingly neat drawings of oriental markets and foreign cities, which Kilian had created solely from the merchants’ descriptions. He didn’t know if they were accurate, but whenever time allowed, he’d pick up a piece of charcoal and draw in his notebook, hoping that one of these days, he’d travel to those foreign lands.

Madlen knew how much her brother was tormented by their humble, cramped living quarters. She also knew that Kilian worked in the shop for his father’s sake and bore the brunt of many tasks his father should have done. She loved Kilian with all her heart and admired him for his uncompromising integrity. She prayed with all her might that he would free himself of carpentry work and stale cottage air to take his rightful place in the world. Although she was scared about what would become of her and her father if he left, her fear that Kilian would waste his life was even greater."
B0142BVMF41,B0142BVMF4,"After Madlen arrived back home, she told Jerg and Kilian what had transpired, not failing to mention that Matthias Trauenstein, Adelhaid’s own husband, had caused the miscarriage. Jerg was speechless; he shook his head in disbelief. Kilian, however, cursed the nobleman. It did Madlen good to hear her brother speak against such a monster. Madlen knew very few people who willingly got involved in such matters. Kilian, however, didn’t mince words, regardless of the consequences. He didn’t have especially high expectations for his life. One day, he would take over his father’s woodshop. Day in, day out, he would build tables, benches, cabinets, and chairs. Occasionally, he would fashion a decorative stair railing for one of the noblemen’s houses. Every day would be the same as the next.

Madlen knew that Kilian would have been all too happy to take up another profession. He had always been interested in the stories of traveling tradesmen who passed through Heidelberg. When there wasn’t enough work in the woodshop, Kilian would go to the nearby tavern and take care of the guests’ horses. He would often come home with interesting stories about journeys to distant lands, his eyes aglow. He seemed especially intrigued by colorful tales of the Far East, like no other place in the world."
B002N83GSA0,B002N83GSA,"There was a dirty underbelly to most multinational corporations that worked in regions of the world with more thugs than cops, with more hungry people who wanted to work than educated people who wanted to organize and bring about reform. Yes, most MNCs used methods that would never make the topic list of the chairmen’s briefing or a budget line in the annual financial report, but LaurentGroup was known as an especially heavy-handed company when it came to third-world assets and resources.

And this did not hurt the stock price at all.

Donald Fitzroy forced his worry about the other affair from his head, thumbed the intercom button, and asked his secretary to escort the visitor in.

Fitzroy first noticed the handsome young man’s suit. This was a local custom in London. Identify the tailor, and know the man. It was a Huntsman, a Savile Row shop that Sir Donald recognized, and it told Fitzroy much about his guest. Sir Donald was a Norton & Sons man himself, dapper but a tad less businessy. Still, he appreciated the young man’s style. With a quick and practiced glance, the Englishman determined his visitor to be a barrister, well-educated, and American, though respectful of customs and manners here in the United Kingdom."
B002N83GSA1,B002N83GSA,"What was irregular about this call, and the reason Fitzroy could hardly ask the emphatic young man to return another day, was the fact his visitor was in the employ of LaurentGroup, a mammoth French conglomerate that ran shipping, trucking, engineering, and port facilities for the oil, gas, and mineral industries throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. They were Fitzroy’s largest customer, and for this reason alone he would not send the man off with apologies, no matter what other matters pressed.

Fitzroy’s firm ran site security at LaurentGroup’s corporate offices in Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK, but as large as was Fitzroy’s contract with Laurent as compared to CSS’s other corporate accounts, Sir Donald knew it was no more than a drop in the bucket as far as the mammoth corporation’s total annual security budget. It was well known in protection circles that LaurentGroup ran their own security departments in a decentralized fashion, hiring locals to do most of the heavy lifting in the eighty-odd nations where the corporation owned property. This might mean something as innocuous as vetting secretaries at an office in Kuala Lumpur, but it also included the nefarious, like having a recalcitrant dockworker’s legs broken in Bombay, or a problematic union rally broken up in Gdansk.

And surely, from time to time, executives at Laurent’s Paris home office required a problem to go away in a more permanent fashion, and Fitzroy knew they had men on call for that, as well."
B009K8RHNQ0,B009K8RHNQ,"Knowing I was about to get hit over the head with a blackjack, or the blackjack actually hitting me over the head. It didn’t matter. The world went black right after impact.

I’m not sure how long I was unconscious. I couldn’t be sure I had actually regained consciousness. My head hurt like hell. The dark room offered no signs as to whether the sun had come up yet or not. I blinked the sleep away, opened my eyes and squinted as they adapted to the dark surroundings. Tainted air burned my lungs during a deep breath. They stretched and filled to capacity. The slow exhale eased some of the pressure and pain in my head.

My hands and arms tingled. I shook them until full sensation returned. Then I sat up and stretched my arms behind my back and felt a twinge of pain in my shoulder followed by a shot of pain radiating across my back and down my arm. I must have injured it when they cuffed me, although I didn’t remember resisting hard enough for my shoulder to sprain. It didn’t matter. I took another deep breath and pushed away the pain, closed my eyes, tried to relax. I managed three exhales and then there was a knock on the door."
B009K8RHNQ1,B009K8RHNQ,"We’d spent enough time with Martinez to know he was a high-strung, high-motor midget. His guys weren’t any different, either. This incident wasn’t the first time that we’d squared off. It had happened three other times, including once on base. But this time he seemed to be daring me to make a move. Every time we got into it, it was because he pushed the limits on acceptable treatment of detainees. He pushed further than ever before with the woman, and in front of her kids, nonetheless. For a moment, I thought he’d pull the trigger. He might’ve had I not said anything. His guys sure wouldn’t stop him. Pussies.

The gauntlet would come down on me over this. I knew that. It was their word against ours. There were four of them and two of us. Their bosses wouldn’t bother questioning the family for their account of what happened. My bosses were in the U.S. in the Carolinas. I needed to call Abbot and Keller. Give them my side of the story before anyone else talked to them.

I got dressed, exited the restroom and walked back down the empty hallway to our room.

I pushed the door open and called out to Bear from the hallway."

No, it was a story you told, how the boy crouched amongst the trees and looked up and saw her, her face as pale as her nightdress in the moonlight; how he looked up and saw her flinging herself, arms spread like wings, into the silent air; how the cry on her lips died as she hit the black water.

I don’t even know whether there really was a boy who saw his mother die, or whether you made the whole thing up.

I left my old room and turned to yours, the place that used to be yours, the place that, by the look of it, is now your daughter’s. A chaotic mess of clothes and books, a damp towel lying on the floor, dirty mugs on the bedside table, a fug of stale smoke in the air and the cloying smell of rotting lilies, wilting in a vase next to the window.

Without thinking, I began to tidy up. I straightened the bedding and hung the towel on the rail in the en suite. I was on my knees, retrieving a dirty plate from under the bed, when I heard your voice, a dagger in my chest."

You never changed. I should have known that. I did know that. You loved the Mill House and the water and you were obsessed with those women, what they did and who they left behind. And now this. Honestly, Nel. Did you really take it that far?

Upstairs, I hesitated outside the master bedroom. My fingers on the door handle, I took a deep breath. I knew what they had told me but I also knew you, and I couldn’t believe them. I felt sure that when I opened the door, there you would be, tall and thin and not at all pleased to see me.

The room was empty. It had the feeling of a place just vacated, as though you’d just slipped out and run downstairs to make a cup of coffee. As though you’d be back any minute. I could still smell your perfume in the air, something rich and sweet and old-fashioned, like one of the ones Mum used to wear, Opium or Yvresse."

Almost two levels worth of stats added to both strength and agility, just from gear alone. I waved a hand to dismiss the character sheet information from my vision and turned back towards the forge, intent on cleaning up my mess before setting out for the day. That’s almost double what my old Webwood Striker armor set gave. Though, in fairness, this armor set is a tier higher in rarity in addition to being three levels hig- oh! That reminds me. I need to check on Razor!

Pulling my trusty blade from its sheath, my heart sank as I realized that it had seen better days. The bronze metal no longer carried its old bright sheen, and numerous battle scars now adorned the length of the sword. I had done my best to repair the weapon, smoothing out chips and completely replacing the hilt and wrapping, but it was a losing battle at best. As much as I hated to admit it, it was only a matter of time before I was forced to retire Razor, in favor of a more durable weapon. Unfortunately, the core of the blade was simply too worn and damaged for me to melt down the blade and try Re-Forging it for a second time."

With each piece of armor I put on , I felt my strength and agility improve, the minor bonuses of each item adding up.

Without a doubt, I probably have the best all-around set of armor in the Town. I couldn’t help but smile with pride as I inspected my gear. Working from the seemingly endless pile of broken chainmail scraps and armor fragments we’d recovered from the Tower, I’d managed to cobble together a set of armor for myself, my friends, and Freya’s group, giving all of us a rather substantial advantage over the other players in Aldford.

Which we thankfully haven’t been forced to show, I thought happily, looking back on the last few weeks. All the Players have been eager to help out and carry their own weight, plus the memory of Graves is still reasonably fresh in everyone’s mind, so no one has tried to make a scene.

I couldn’t help but check over my Attributes one more time, after having equipped all of my gear. I always enjoyed seeing the contrast between my regular unarmored self and my fully equipped self.

Turning around, she looks out her kitchen window toward the McDaniel house and sees Ella getting out of her car and going inside. Who is she, an’ where is she from?

All of a sudden Tucker makes a decision. Going out the back door she walks around to the side of the house, where there are two large, tin-covered, hinged doors on the ground. She grabs the handle of one and pulls it open until it rests on the ground, then does the same with the other door. Carefully, she walks down the steps into the dark cellar.

After a few minutes, she steps back out into the sunshine with a half-full tow sack slung over her shoulder. She sets the sack down so she can close the doors, then picks the sack back up. She lumbers around her house, through the front yard, and onto the gravel road leading to Ella’s.

On the way, she notices a bluebird sitting on a wooden fence post and hears a meadowlark’s song."

Walking into her kitchen with its cardboard lined walls, Tucker sets the pie on her Formica dining table. Leaning back against the countertop, she stares absentmindedly at the pie. More memories, the ones she tries to keep locked away, are seeping out.

She is six years old and staring at her mama’s freshly baked pie cooling in the open window over the kitchen sink. The smell of apples and cinnamon permeate the air. Her mother is busy washing the dishes when the back door swings open and her father walks in."

None of the skyscrapers downtown were lit up. Just dark obelisks stabbing up at the sky. The sight of the buildings brought joy to Connie though because it meant no bombs had struck Dallas.

Fort Worth is probably okay too, she thought.

She barely noticed the tiny figures ahead on the freeway. As her headlights got closer, she saw a dozen thugs standing across the freeway, each one holding a weapon of some sort. A mix of baseball bats and two-by-fours. Connie saw a car that had stopped – the driver was being beaten senseless.

Not today.

She gunned it and aimed for the biggest gap in the line. Instead of moving apart to avoid the automotive death-machine approaching them, the thugs started moving together. Connie didn’t slow down. She passed right through the line at full speed. A loud BANG hit the drivers’ side mirror. It flung back for a brief second, but bounced right back into place. The mirror itself was shattered. She looked in the rear-view mirror just in time to see a body rolling along the pavement."

Twenty minutes after the last deep-space antenna on Earth was destroyed, the first sign of what was to come showed up as a blinking warning message on a laptop screen, the computer that monitored data transfers between Earth and Mars. No signal.

The Alston family getaway car

Somewhere between Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth

The Honda was running on fumes, occasionally lurching as the engine gasped for more fuel. Connie guided the car off the freeway near the tiny town of Alma. The gas stations there were out of everything, including fuel and bullets. Using directions from a local resident, she continued on the small road away from the freeway, looking for the tiny town of Eugene.

Connie reached Eugene after a few minutes of driving and pulled into the small two-pump gas station. The engine gave its last gasp of life and died. She was trying to get out of her car when the attendant came out, wiping his hands with an old greasy towel."
B01I0X1H3M0,B01I0X1H3M,"I didn’t get this nervous when I was taking my final exams at Oxford! It was only a stupid cat show—who cared what one little man thought? It didn’t mean that Muesli was a lesser cat or less beautiful than any of the other felines here just because she wasn’t awarded a blue ribbon.

Still, it was hard to control my nerves. And looking around, I could see that I wasn’t the only one. In fact, even Dame Clare, a veteran of cat shows, looked flushed and uneasy, beads of sweat standing out on her forehead. She tugged at the high collar of her Victorian blouse and I could see her breathing with effort. I glanced at my mother and marvelled again at her serene demeanour. She looked supremely unconcerned, her hands gently holding Muesli, her head tilted back gracefully and an expectant smile on her lips. If you could get marks for poise and elegance, my mother would have won the show already.

The judge stopped at the table just before the Siamese, where a large Ragdoll cat sat placidly, waiting to be examined. But as he moved forward to pick up the cat, the air was suddenly rent by a shriek of distress."
B01I0X1H3M1,B01I0X1H3M,"My goodness, they really take this seriously, I thought, as I walked past cages where owners were practising holding their cats up for the judge to examine. The tension in the air was palpable. When I got back to our table, I could see that even the great Dame Clare was affected. Her beloved Victoria sponge cake was all forgotten now, a half-eaten plate sitting next to the cat cage, as she manically gave Camilla one final brush and her daughter hovered anxiously around her.

My mother, however, looked serene and confident as she stood next to our table. I marvelled at her calm complacency and thought uneasily again of Muesli’s ineligibility to be in a show like this. There was no way that was going to escape notice when the judge arrived. I hoped he wouldn’t be too harsh. No matter how exasperating I found her, I hated the thought of my mother being humiliated in front of everyone.

The judging began and I joined everybody else in anxiously watching the judge’s progress as he made his way slowly down each row of tables. The pavilion seemed even hotter and more airless now, and I felt myself sweating in my wool dress."
B07B6BJHXR0,B07B6BJHXR,"If there were other evidence against him, he could be sent for P and D, and usually was. If the tests proved he’d told the truth, charges were dismissed. If he admitted the charges, as the sophisticated mix of drugs forced him to do, his confession was of course introduced as evidence.

However, two safeguards applied. The subject had to have been charged with a crime, and he had to have denied the charge.

Without those limitations, poly and drugs could become tools of a despot or, worse, of torture. The law didn’t allow the court a fishing expedition into a man’s mind to discover what crimes he might have committed.

I kept an eye on the time, not at all concerned that I’d left Alexi and Sandy alone. I’d given a direct order that they’d acknowledged. They would have no conversation while they toiled in the exercise room.

I dozed.

As the fourth hour neared its end I got wearily to my feet, trudged down to Level 2.

Hibernia’s launch berth was normally sealed. Darla had record of each occasion our crewmen were admitted for maintenance since we’d left Earthport. Counting the various work details assigned to shepherd the passengers across, seventeen crewmen had been in the launch berth at one time or another. All four of us middies had gone across to Celestina, and each of the officers save the members of the board.

One by one each sailor who’d been in the berth was questioned. Alexi, Vax, and I sat stiffly in the chairs placed in the corridor, knees tight, caps in hand, waiting our turns.

They brought Sandy from the brig for his interrogation; he marched past us with barely a glance. Two hours later he emerged, pale, shaken. It appeared he’d been crying.

I was next. I smoothed my jacket, tugged at my tie, marched into the crowded mess. My salute was as close to Academy perfection as I could manage.

I think of the days of our childhood when we were taught by different tutors, when they kept us apart so that I might learn needlework and he Greek, and how few days I had with him, my brother. I don’t know how I can bear it without him. We were four Tudor children, and now we are only three, and the firstborn and the finest has gone.

I am walking down the gallery away from my mother’s rooms when I see Harry, his face all puffed and his eyes red from crying, coming the opposite way. When he sees me his little mouth goes downturned as if he is about to wail, and all my anger and my grief turns on him, this worthless boy, this brat, who presumes to cry as if he were the only person in the world to lose a brother."

They don’t just lose their boy—and he was not yet sixteen — they lose their heir, the boy they trained to be the next king, the Tudor who was to come to the throne with acclaim, a Tudor that the people wanted, not one that was forced on them. My father had to fight for his throne and then defend it. He has to defend it still, even now, against the older royal family who would take it if they could, the Plantagenet cousins who are in open enmity in Europe, or those who stay uncertainly at court. Arthur was going to be the first Tudor that all of England welcomed to the throne, the son of both the old royal family and the new. They called him the sweet briar, the Tudor rose, the bush that was the union of two roses, the Lancaster red and the York white.

This is the end of my childhood. Arthur was my brother, my darling, my friend. I looked up to him as my senior, I acknowledged him as my prince, I thought I would see him come to the throne as king. I imagined him ruling in England and"

Now the only time Sophie spoke to him was to moan at him for his music being too loud, or because one of his guests was laughing too loudly in the hallway. I mean, come on. Who on earth gets angry because they hear laughter? The girl was, quite simply, a pain in his arse. And he wanted to get under her skin. Good thing he had an idea or two how to do that.

Sophie

As Sophie left her flat that morning, as immature as it may have been, she couldn’t resist closing her door hard. Make that slamming her door especially hard. She gave a snort of laughter, imagining Nathan and his supermodel clutching their sore heads. The way her petty was set up, she went for little digs. It was a satisfying start to her day."
B07878WDLK1,B07878WDLK,"He’d actually started to enjoy sparring with her. He liked getting a rise out of her. Just like she got a rise out of him. Pun intended. He hadn’t missed her blatant appraisal of him.

One night, she’d started by banging the shit out of his door because she reckoned his music was too loud. He’d tried to invite her in. His friends had come from Warwickshire, and he genuinely wanted her to come and get to know him over a drink.

That was when he’d learned that she was seriously uptight.

Her boyfriend looked like a wound-up old fart too, but Nathan was more than familiar with getting the cold shoulder from pretty girls’ boyfriends, so he wasn’t too fussed. He couldn’t say he liked the lad, though. He pretty much had twat written all over him. The two of them barely seemed to spend any time together, anyway. In Nathan’s opinion, she could do better.

Sophie had said that she had work in the morning. Who in their right mind had a job where they had to work early on a Saturday? He worked hard, but hell, he knew how to have a good time.

Sophie never had any fun. Ever."
B0081BTOJS0,B0081BTOJS,"Ten days remained before I was due to go.

Things became very difficult with Alison. I had to give up the flat in Russell Square and we spent three frustrating days looking for somewhere for her to live. Eventually we found a large studio-room off Baker Street. The move, packing things, upset us both. I didn’t have to go until October 2nd, but Alison had already started work, and the need to get up early, to introduce order into our life, was too much for us. We had two dreadful rows. The first one she started, and stoked, and built up to a white-hot outpouring of contempt for men, and me in particular. I was a snob, a prig, a twopenny-half-penny Don Juan—and so on. The next day—she had been icily mute at breakfast—when I went in the evening to meet her, she was not there. I waited an hour, then I went home. She wasn’t there, either. I telephoned: no air-hostess trainees had been kept late. I waited, getting angrier and angrier, until eleven o’clock, and then she came in. She went to the bathroom, took her coat off, put on the milk she always had before bed, and said not a word."
B0081BTOJS1,B0081BTOJS,"I remember one day when we were standing in one of the rooms at the Tate. Alison was leaning slightly against me, holding my hand, looking in her childish sweet-sucking way at a Renoir. I suddenly had a feeling that we were one body, one person, even there; that if she had disappeared it would have been as if I had lost half of myself. A terrible deathlike feeling, which anyone less cerebral and self-absorbed than I was then would have realized was simply love. I thought it was desire. I drove her straight home and tore her clothes off.

Another day, in Jermyn Street, we ran into Billy Whyte, an Old Etonian I had known quite well at Magdalen; he’d been one of the Hommes Révoltés. He was pleasant enough, not in the least snobbish—but he carried with him, perhaps in spite of himself, an unsloughable air of high caste, of constant contact with the nicest best people, of impeccable upper-class taste in facial expression, clothes, vocabulary. We went off to an oyster bar; he’d just heard the first Colchesters of the season were in. Alison said very little, but I was embarrassed by her, by her accent, by the difference between her and one or two debs who were sitting near us."
B002UBRFDC0,B002UBRFDC,"Obviously the ship had to be investigated at once but Toranaga was still away in Osaka for the final confrontation with General Lord Ishido and, in his absence, had invited Yabu and all friendly neighboring daimyos to wait until his return. Such an invitation could not be refused without dire results. Yabu knew that he and the other independent daimyos and their families were merely added protection for Toranaga’s safety and, though of course the word would never be used, they were hostages against Toranaga’s safe return from the impregnable enemy fortress at Osaka where the meeting was being held. Toranaga was President of the Council of Regents which the Taikō had appointed on his deathbed to rule the empire during the minority of his son Yaemon, now seven years old. There were five Regents, all eminent daimyos, but only Toranaga and Ishido had real power.

Yabu had carefully considered all the reasons for going to Anjiro, the risks involved, and the reasons for staying. Then he had sent for his wife and his favorite consort. A consort was a formal, legal mistress. A man could have as many consorts as he wished, but only one wife at one time."
B002UBRFDC1,B002UBRFDC,"The use of guns was considered cowardly and dishonorable and completely against the samurai code, bushido, the Way of the Warrior, which bound samurai to fight with honor, to live with honor, and to die with honor; to have undying, unquestioning loyalty to one’s feudal lord; to be fearless of death—even to seek it in his service; and to be proud of one’s own name and keep it unsullied.

For years Yabu had had a secret theory. At long last, he thought exultantly, you can expand it and put it into effect: Five hundred chosen samurai, armed with muskets but trained as a unit, spearheading your twelve thousand conventional troops, supported by twenty cannon used in a special way by special men, also trained as a unit. A new strategy for a new era! In the coming war, guns could be decisive!

What about bushido? the ghosts of his ancestors had always asked him.

What about bushido? he had always asked them back.

They had never answered.

Never in his wildest dreams had he thought he’d ever be able to afford five hundred guns. But now he had them for nothing and he alone knew how to use them. But whose side to use them for? Toranaga’s or Ishido ’s? Or should he wait —and perhaps be the eventual victor?"
B001NLL6QW0,B001NLL6QW,"Everyone else in the Brook worked throughout the sun, and barely saw all their needs met, but Hog and his daughters always had fleshy cheeks, rounded bellies, and clean new clothes. Arlen had to wrap himself in a rug whenever his mother took his overalls to wash.

Ragen and Arlen tied off the mules in front of the store and went inside. The bar was empty. Usually the air inside the taproom was thick with bacon fat, but there was no smell of cooking from the kitchen today.

Arlen rushed ahead of the Messenger to the bar. Rusco had a small bronze bell there, brought with him when he came from the Free Cities. Arlen loved that bell. He slapped his hand down on it and grinned at the clear sound.

There was a thump in the back, and Rusco came through the curtains behind the bar. He was a big man, still strong and straight-backed at sixty, but a soft gut hung around his middle, and his iron-gray hair was creeping back from his lined forehead. He wore light trousers and leather shoes with a clean white cotton shirt, the sleeves rolled halfway up his thick forearms. His white apron was spotless, as always."
B001NLL6QW1,B001NLL6QW,"It had a large open front room that housed tables and the bar, an even larger storeroom in back, and a cellar below, filled with most everything of value in the Brook.

The kitchen was run by Hog’s daughters, Dasy and Catrin. Two credits could buy a meal to leave you stuffed, but Silvy called old Hog a cheat, since two credits could buy enough raw grain for a week. Still, plenty of unmarried men paid the price, and not all for the food. Dasy was homely and Catrin fat, but Uncle Cholie said the men who married them would be set for life.

Everyone in the Brook brought Hog their goods, be it corn or meat or fur, pottery or cloth, furniture or tools. Hog took the items, counted them up, and gave the customers credits to buy other things at the store.

Things always seemed to cost a lot more than Hog paid for them, though. Arlen knew enough numbers to see that. There were some famous arguments when people came to sell, but Hog set the prices, and usually got his way. Just about everyone hated Hog, but they needed him all the same, and were more likely to brush his coat and open his doors than spit when he passed."
B003XRELGQ0,B003XRELGQ,"The whore, who said her name was Sandra, offered me delights unobtainable outside of Place Pigalle and Port Said. I said I wasn’t interested, and she was bright enough to say that she wasn’t really interested either. As things turned out, we had both overestimated our apathies, but not by much.

Before we took the measure of each other’s passions, however, we talked about Frank Hoenikker, and we talked about the old man, and we talked a little about Asa Breed, and we talked about the General Forge and Foundry Company, and we talked about the Pope and birth control, about Hitler and the Jews. We talked about phonies. We talked about truth. We talked about gangsters; we talked about business. We talked about the nice poor people who went to the electric chair; and we talked about the rich bastards who didn’t. We talked about religious people who had perversions. We talked about a lot of things.

We got drunk.

The bartender was very nice to Sandra. He liked her. He respected her. He told me that Sandra had been chairman of the Class Colors Committee at Ilium High. Every class, he explained, got to pick distinctive colors for itself in its junior year, and then it got to wear those colors with pride."
B003XRELGQ1,B003XRELGQ,"And, according to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place this Jonah was there.

Listen:

When I was a younger man—two wives ago, 250,000 cigarettes ago, 3,000 quarts of booze ago…

When I was a much younger man, I began to collect material for a book to be called The Day the World Ended.

The book was to be factual.

The book was to be an account of what important Americans had done on the day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan.

It was to be a Christian book. I was a Christian then.

I am a Bokononist now.

I would have been a Bokononist then, if there had been anyone to teach me the bittersweet lies of Bokonon. But Bokononism was unknown beyond the gravel beaches and coral knives that ring this little island in the Caribbean Sea, the Republic of San Lorenzo.

We Bokononists believe that humanity is organized into teams, teams that do God’s Will without ever discovering what they are doing. Such a team is called a karass by Bokonon, and the instrument, the kan-kan, that brought me into my own particular karass was the book I never finished, the book to be called The Day the World Ended.

NICE, NICE, VERY NICE"
B0743BCKB90,B0743BCKB9,"What might she see, if she looked at the images in just the right way? She let her gaze soften and drift sideways, hoping to sneak up on whatever was just out of view.

Her gaze softened further, her head moved closer to the screen, and before she knew it, she was facedown on the console, snoring softly.

She was climbing a high, narrow scaffold. As she ascended, she saw that it actually wasn’t a scaffold; it was the open steel framework of an immense reflecting telescope: the skeleton of a vast tube, without an outer skin. When she reached the top—the telescope’s open end — she hoisted herself up and stood, balancing on a narrow, curving beam of steel. Overhead, the Milky Way flowed across the sky, its stars so abundant in the high, clear air of La Palma that it seemed a solid river of light rather than billions of individual specks.

O’Malley narrowed her gaze, ignoring the sky-spanning splendor, and focused intently on one small region: the region, blacker and closer than the backdrop of stars, where she suspected a dark, frozen world lurked, unseen and yet powerful, exerting its influence on every other planet, including Earth."
B0743BCKB91,B0743BCKB9,"Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all wobbled slightly, as if something—something distant but massive—was tugging on them from the outer dark. Whoever first found and photographed that something would have naming rights, as well as a lasting place in astronomical history, so O’Malley was doubly eager to be that person.

She pulled an oversize, borrowed jacket around her shoulders—a guilty loan from the woman who had sent her car off the cliff. The woman had also given her a ride the rest of the way to the observatory, where she, too, was heading: not an astronomer, she’d explained, but a friend of an astronomer. O’Malley had accepted the coat with more grace and gratitude than she had accepted the woman’s apology. It was a challenge to be gracious when all of her warm clothes, toiletries, and even her precious laptop lay submerged beneath the sea cliff.

Zipping the coat against the chill, she turned to the telescope’s control panel. She was here; that was what mattered. The quest, the prospect of being the one to find Planet Nine, was enough to make up for the loss. Almost.

But her excitement didn’t last long. Ninety minutes later, the rush—even the memory of the rush—evaporated."
B01MSYH43Q0,B01MSYH43Q,"As I dabbed on concealer, I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes were terrible. In addition to the lack of sleep, the stress of everything I’d found out recently must have been getting to me more than I’d realized.

Once ready, I paced around my room, waiting for Blake to text me that he was here. Finally my phone buzzed.

I’m in front of your house … I think. Blue with the gabled windows?

I peeked through the blinds. A black Range Rover was parked on the street, with Blake in the driver’s seat.

I see you, I wrote back. I’ll be out in a minute.

I walked out of my room and into the hall. My parents’ room was on the first floor, so the second floor of the house was small—only the bathroom and the steps separated my room from my sister’s. Light shined from underneath her door, and I heard the tapping of computer keys as she talked with her friends online.

I hadn’t expected her to still be awake. This would make things trickier.

My door creaked loudly as it closed—stupid old houses. I only made it one more step before Becca’s door opened.

She crossed her arms and leaned against the wall, a smug smile on her face."
B01MSYH43Q1,B01MSYH43Q,"That way, no one would get hurt.

But if I didn’t reply, I would toss and turn all night, unable to fall asleep because I would be so curious about what he wanted to say.

So I had to text him back. It would drive me too crazy if I didn’t.

Yeah, I typed. I’m trying to sleep, but it’s not working well.

I sent it, and his response came in seconds.

Wanna hang out? I can come pick you up.

My heart jumped into my throat. Because yes, of course I wanted to hang out with Blake. I wanted to see him—just the two of us, alone —more than anything. I wanted to know if whatever I was feeling for him was just in my head, or if he felt it, too. Because if he was reaching out to me like this, it had to mean he was interested. Right?

Unfortunately, it wasn’t that simple, no matter how much I wished it could be.

What about your girlfriend? I asked.

I watched the text bubble move as he typed, so nervous that I could barely breathe.

Things with Danielle are … complicated. It’s too much to explain over text."
B01MXTG76U0,B01MXTG76U,"A line of cars outside my house is my first indication that my brother is throwing a party. The second is the thumping music that vibrates through the bay windows. Fuck.

I was hoping to get Travis alone.

He wouldn’t tell me over the phone, but I’m pretty sure he’s dug himself into another hole. One that I’m going to have to bail him out of – again.

This shit is getting old. And so am I. Too old to be cleaning up after him.

Sure, I’ve done things I’m not proud of, but there comes a time when you need to grow the hell up.

From the foyer, I can see a handful of people in the living room, and another half dozen in the kitchen. But no sign of my brother anywhere.

I drop my luggage at the front door, and a few heads turn to look in my direction, then continue on with whatever they’d been doing, which consists mostly of drinking and smoking up.

The house smells like a goddamn fraternity. Beer. Cigarettes. Pot. Sex.

There’s a group of three guys sharing a bong on the living room couch. A couch I just replaced six months ago because Travis’ buddies set fire to the old one, nearly burning down the damn house."
B01MXTG76U1,B01MXTG76U,"It’s begging me to cross the fifteen feet of space between us and make her mine – at least for tonight.

I’m not the only guy who’s noticed her.

With gritted teeth, I watch as a meathead-looking dude approaches her, a cocky ass grin on his ugly face. Across the room, a table of rowdy guys yell out a few crude comments, edging him forward.

He leans on the bar in front of her, getting in her personal space.

If it wasn’t there before, it is now. The big fuck-off sign plastered on her forehead. But the guy either doesn’t notice, or doesn’t care.

Yeah, so not going to happen, buddy. I almost feel sorry for the bastard, until he puts his hands on her.

He reaches out and drags his fingers down her bare arm. It’s a subtle touch, but it stirs the inner caveman inside of me.

Walk away, Carter , I tell myself. No girl is worth a fight. Especially not a bar fight.

But, hell, the overprotective Neanderthal part of my brain kicks into high gear, muting out all common sense.

The guy is practically mauling her by the time I cross the distance between us."
B00NAJZDIM0,B00NAJZDIM,"The first thing I notice are five flawless leather seats, two lined up one behind the other on each side of a small aisle and one more in the rear middle. Margaret squeezes past our flight attendant, who’s quietly milling around in the front of the plane, and heads toward the second row of seats. There are TV screens on the back of every seat and enough snacks and drinks for Daniel’s whole kindergarten class. Looks like I was wrong. This is traveling in style. I mean, food and television? That’s my kind of vacation.

I should’ve trusted Janice, the Carlton rep. She kept telling us that the second half of our trip’s supposed to be amazing. She’s never actually been to Adiata Beach. Her boss usually goes on both parts of the trip, but he couldn’t make it for the first week this year, our week in Fiji. They had a huge drawing in the PR department to see who’d go instead and Janice won. I’m bummed she won’t be with us now, but she says her boss is a nice enough guy. There’s no way he’s going to make me laugh like Janice did; that lady was hilarious. She gave me her e-mail address so we can keep in touch."
B00NAJZDIM1,B00NAJZDIM,"She’d recognize that face anywhere: the long, thin nose and high, hollow cheekbones, her blonde hair moving like a helmet of styled straw, and those eyes, so light blue they almost faded away. They all belonged, unmistakably, to Genevieve Randall from Headline News. Lillian and Jerry used to watch the news program every Friday night, arguing playfully about the real-life sagas Ms. Randall narrated on the screen. She was even thinner in real life.

Great. The camera really does add ten pounds. Lillian sucked her stomach roll behind her belt.

The crew snaked a mic through the back of the investigative reporter’s coat jacket and shirt, then clipped it discreetly on her lapel. Lillian was impressed at how well Genevieve Randall ignored the hands grasping around inside her blouse. She shuffled through a deck of notecards until they finished. Then, she straightened her suit coat, fluffing the white silk blouse that peeked out through the vee of her lapels. Snatching up a few more papers, she stacked them into a neat pile before resting her ghostly gaze on Lillian.

For a brief moment it felt as though the reporter was staring through her, or more like into her, like she could see all of the secrets lined up inside Lillian’s mind. It made Lillian want to wrap her arms around her body to ward off the X-ray eyes."

Good thing I didn’t go to work today. It was Wednesday, and I was supposed to have been working at the office, though I didn’t want to kick off my service in the company with a reprimand. The bosses wouldn’t mind, I figured, since I was getting a lot out of it —not the least of which was that I had unlocked all kinds of places on my map. Who knew which of them I might need later?

With that in mind, Vika was given complete authority and instructions to email me everything. That morning, I dug around in the material my team had gathered, approving some things, discarding others, and offering plenty of sage wisdom. Then, I dashed off to the barracks.

A quick check of my map told me that I was right on the money. The village we were at was just a two- or three-hour walk from the copse at the center of the red spot. The only problem was that I doubted I’d make it there alone, judging by everything I’d been in the middle of the past four days."
B0756GCJP61,B0756GCJP6,"My feet slipped on the slime left by crawling little nasties, and I tripped over the dead bodies of muscular gibbons wearing helmets.

My level jumped to 55, and one of my abilities leveled up as well.

I died a couple times, too. One of my deaths came at the worst possible time when a blade wielded by a one-eyed, bow-legged marauder found a crack in my armor right at the end of a battle I’d fought well in. The bonus I was looking for slipped through my fingers as Lane, who was everywhere, finished off the marauder.

Despite the loss, I was heartened by the fact that I didn’t lose any of the experience I’d previously built up when I died. That was a small compensation the developers had put in place to placate frustrated players. Also, dying on the field of battle meant you could have the company’s armorers fix everything up for you free of charge. So there was a little balance, at least.

A message popped up when I polished off a large turtle that came at us with surprising speed and agility for its kind. It and a few of its friends were trying to make off with a village’s children. I couldn’t pronounce the name of the village.

The work seemed harder than usual because Magdalena’s father had left for Regensburg a few days ago. As the family of the hangman, it was the Kuisls’ job to clear the streets in Schongau of garbage and animal carcasses. Every week mountains of trash piled up at the corners and intersections in town, rotting in the hot sun. Rats with long, smooth tails scampered about on top of the piles, glaring at passersby with evil little eyes. At least Magdalena had the afternoon to herself.

After just a few minutes the hangman’s daughter arrived at the riverbank. She turned to the left, away from the raft landing where there were already a half-dozen rafts tied up. She could hear the shouts and laughter of the raftsmen as they unloaded the barrels, crates, and bales and took them off to the newly rebuilt storage building, the Zimmerstadel, on the pier. She turned off the narrow towpath and made her way through the green underbrush, which now, in midsummer, was shoulder-high. The ground was swampy and slippery, and with each step her bare feet sank in with a slurping sound."

The hangman had almost slipped away from him, but the man knew his enemy would have to pass through Jakob’s Gate—there was no other way into town from the west. The man had run from the raft landing to the gate as fast as possible to warn the guards. A bit of money in the right hands had won them the time they needed to carry out their plan.

Revenge! How long they both had been waiting for that…!

SCHONGAU

AUGUST 13, 1662 AD

THE OPPRESSIVE SUMMER air lay over Schongau like a musty blanket.

Magdalena Kuisl ran down the narrow overgrown path from the Tanners’ Quarter to the Lech, her skirt fluttering behind her. Her mother had given her the afternoon off and her strict father was far away, so she raced through the cool, shady land along the river, happy to escape the stuffiness and the stench in town.

Magdalena looked forward to a swim in the river, as the odor of manure, dirt, and mold clung to her matted black hair."
B00EMXBDMA0,B00EMXBDMA,"It’ll be a lot of work, but I’m going to need to cover the entire floor to a depth of 10 centimeters. That means I’ll have to transport 9.2 cubic meters of Martian soil into the Hab. I can get maybe one-tenth of a cubic meter in through the airlock at a time, and it’ll be backbreaking work to collect it. But in the end, if everything goes to plan, I’ll have 92 square meters of crop-able soil.

Hell yeah I’m a botanist! Fear my botany powers!

LOG ENTRY: SOL 15

Ugh! This is backbreaking work!

I spent twelve hours today on EVAs to bring dirt into the Hab. I only managed to cover a small corner of the base, maybe five square meters. At this rate it’ll take me weeks to get all the soil in. But hey, time is one thing I’ve got.

The first few EVAs were pretty inefficient; me filling small containers and bringing them in through the airlock. Then I got wise and just put one big container in the airlock itself and filled that with small containers till it was full. That sped things up a lot because the airlock takes about ten minutes to get through."
B00EMXBDMA1,B00EMXBDMA,"Shit is usually vaccum-dried, then accumulated in sealed bags to be discarded on the surface.

Not anymore!

In fact, I even did an EVA to recover the previous bags of shit from before the crew left. Being completely desiccated, this particular shit didn’t have bacteria in it anymore, but it still had complex proteins and would serve as useful manure. Adding it to water and active bacteria would quickly get it inundated, replacing any population killed by the Toilet of Doom.

I found a big container and put a bit of water in it, then added the dried shit. Since then, I’ve added my own shit to it as well. The worse it smells, the better things are going. That’s the bacteria at work!

Once I get some Martian soil in here, I can mix in the shit and spread it out. Then I can sprinkle the Earth soil on top. You might not think that would be an important step, but it is. There are dozens of species of bacteria living in Earth soil, and they’re critical to plant growth. They’ll spread out and breed like…well, like a bacterial infection.

B074DYQ1MB0,B074DYQ1MB,"His previous house on the Palatine had been burned to the ground. Eventually his exile was rescinded by the Senate and he was welcomed back. He moved into another house on the Palatine—and then was forced to flee the city when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and headed for Rome with an army. I vividly remembered visiting him the day he frantically packed his most precious scrolls and valuables, lost in a haze of despair. Now Cicero was back in Rome, pardoned by the Dictator, but clearly uncertain of the future and braced for any new reversal of fortune.

I spared a glance at the wax masks of Cicero’s ancestors in the niches of the vestibule, which unblinkingly watched everyone who came and went. They were a stern-looking bunch, and not very handsome. Some of them exhibited the chickpea-like cleft nose that had earned the family its distinctive cognomen.

Leaving his own bodyguard behind in the vestibule, Tiro led Davus and me past the shallow pool of the atrium and down a hallway to Cicero’s library. Tiro entered the room first. Cicero, seated and clutching a metal stylus and a wax tablet, hardly looked up. He appeared not to notice that Davus and I had also entered the room."
B074DYQ1MB1,B074DYQ1MB,"When first we met, I had lived on the Esquiline Hill and Cicero near the Capitoline Hill. To visit him I had to traverse both the Subura (Rome’s roughest neighborhood) and much of the Forum (the heart of Rome, with its splendid temples and magnificent public spaces). Since then we had both moved up in the world. My house and his were both on the Palatine Hill, Rome’s most exclusive area. We were practically neighbors.

At one point during the short walk, I had a clear view of the top of the Capitoline Hill to the north, crowned by the Temple of Jupiter, one of the most imposing structures on earth. In a prominent place before the temple stood a bronze statue. Though the features were indistinct at such a great distance, I knew the statue well, having seen it unveiled on the day of Caesar’s Gallic Triumph. Standing atop a map of the world, striking a victorious pose and looking down on the Roman Forum below, stood not a mere mortal but a demigod —so declared the inscription on the pedestal, which listed Caesar’s many titles, ending with the declaration, DESCENDANT OF VENUS, DEMIGOD. The statue was visible from virtually every part of the city."
B013UVNZ2K0,B013UVNZ2K,"A stone bridge connected the palace to the island and several wooden bridges connected the island to the main shore and the rest of the city. It was a breathtaking sight, and Owen kept leaning in the saddle to get a better view. The rushing of the waterfall could be heard from miles away, the steady churn of waves that sounded like a constant storm.

The palace was built on a green hill full of lush woods and had many tiers and layers, with sharp-edged walls and easily a dozen turrets flying the royal banners. Owen could see gardens and trees rising above portions of the old stone walls, and to his inexperienced eye, it looked as if the castle had stood for thousands of years. Still, the facade was free of ivy or vines, and had been meticulously kept.

So this would be his new home. The king had summoned Owen to live in the palace as his ward. Owen’s older brother Jorganon had also lived at Kingfountain for a time. And now he was dead. Was that why Maman and Papan had wept so much when Owen left? The palace did not feel like a home. It felt like a monument, a relic of the ages, a dangerous place."
B013UVNZ2K1,B013UVNZ2K,"There was a large island in the middle of the river where a sanctuary had been constructed—Our Lady of Kingfountain. Huge boulders and rocks emerged from the falls, some with spindly trees somehow clinging to them in spite of the surge of foaming water.

Owen knew the building bore that name because of legends from the past, but none of his reading had been able to explain it to him in as much detail as he wanted. The texts he had tried reading to learn more were full of knights, battles, and disparate kingdoms that no longer existed, but they were written in a style too long and boring to hold his interest. The sanctuary had two sturdy towers and a series of arches that loomed over the back shell of the building. The waterways under the arches always flowed, making the sanctuary a replica of the waterfall itself. On one bank of the river lay the city proper, with its wedge-shaped roofs and smoking chimneys. The noise of bleating goats, lowing oxen, and trundling carts and wagons was barely discernible through the constant roar of the waterfall. On the other bank of the river, on the high ground, stood the palace, and it made Tatton Hall seem like a toy in comparison."
B000FA5QAE0,B000FA5QAE,"First when he was a lecherous little kid, then as a dangerous teen. And finally as the guy who at age eighteen, sweet-talked me out of my underwear, laid me down on the floor behind the eclair case one day after work and relieved me of my virginity. Morelli was a cop now, and the only way he'd get back into my pants would be at gunpoint. He worked Vice, and he looked like he knew a lot about it firsthand. He was wearing washed-out Levi's and a navy T-shirt. His hair needed cutting, and his body was perfect. Lean and hard-muscled with the best ass in Trenton … maybe the world. Buns you wanted to sink your teeth into.

Not that I intended to nibble on Morelli. He had an annoying habit of periodically popping up in my life, frustrating the hell out of me and then walking off into the sunset. I couldn't do much about the popping up or the walking off. I could do something about the frustrating. From here on out, Morelli was erotica non grata. Look but Don't Touch, that was my motto. And he could keep his tongue to himself, thank you.

Morelli grinned by way of hello."
B000FA5QAE1,B000FA5QAE,"She really had no reason to skip out.

Now I wasn't so sure. I was getting an uncomfortable feeling about Maxine. Her apartment had been trashed, and her mother had me thinking maybe Maxine didn't want to be found right now. I slunk back to my car and decided my deductive reasoning would be vastly improved if I ate a doughnut. So I cut across town to Hamilton and parked in front of Tasty Pastry Bakery.

I'd worked part-time at Tasty Pastry when I was in high school. It hadn't changed much since then. Same green-and-white linoleum floor. Same sparkling clean display cases filled with Italian cookies, chocolate chip cannoli, biscotti, napoleons, fresh bread and coffee cakes. Same happy smell of fried sweet dough and cinnamon.

Lennie Smulenski and Anthony Zuck bake the goodies in the back room in big steel ovens and troughs of hot oil. Clouds of flour and sugar sift onto table surfaces and slip under foot. And lard is transferred daily from commercial-sized vats directly to local butts.

I choose two Boston cremes and pocketed some napkins. When I came out I found Joe Morelli lounging against my car. I'd known Morelli all of my life."
B078TGJJ7V0,B078TGJJ7V,"They swept through the monsters until they won the rift, leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. And that’s when Ares stepped in. With the sweep of an enormous hand, he motioned for several women wearing goggles to bring forth a statue of him. The women carefully placed the statue down on top of a rocky, but level, outcropping. With practiced ease, the war god traced the sigil I’d seen back in the temple on the chest of the statue with the tip of his sword. A flash of light and a thunderous wave of sound crashed through the world as he finished.

A second later, the rift at the center of the island closed as a tsunami of golden light washed across the island, obliterating Hades’ minions like cockroaches being crushed under the heel of a heavy boot. Even though I knew subconsciously this was some sort of memory, I still couldn’t stand to look — it was just too painful. By the time the light cleared, even the enemy bodies were gone, burned away in holy, purifying fire. In their place were plants. Greenery exploded across the island like a nuclear blast.

Trees, grass, and flowers sprouted up in quadruple speed until only a paradise remained. Miraculously, death had given way to abundant life."
B078TGJJ7V1,B078TGJJ7V,"The world around me spun and shifted, and suddenly I found myself standing next to Ares on the dark clay of an island smoking with molten rock and filled with the screams of harpies, snake men, spider creatures, and various other horrors. A towering cyclops, as tall as a redwood, clambered out of a deep chasm, wielding a hammer the size of a Buick Skylark.

Another version of Ares—this one the twenty-foot-tall gargantuan I’d seen dead in the temple—summoned warrior women out of the clay. In seconds, he had an army at his beck and call. The women were of all shapes, sizes, and colors, but each was pulled from the ground.

Some morphed into wolves. Others cast spells to harness the wind. A few seemed to be able to teleport at will. Several of the women vanished, appeared in front of the cyclops, and chopped into the massive one-eyed man with their swords, only to disappear again. More women, these clad in black clothes, moved silently through the battle, hiding in shadows, backstabbing monsters, or sending feathered shafts into the throats of snake men unaware of their presence. Still others manned a siege tower that had at least five ballistae firing flaming bolts into the fray.

Regardless of their abilities, these warrior women, led by Ares with his flashing sword and stabbing spear, were a devastating force. Amazons, one and all."
B0017DC5UC0,B0017DC5UC,"I wanted to stand in front of the building and have a Ranger revelation.

I crossed the railroad tracks and inched my way along in the morning traffic. The building was at the corner of Adams and Third. It was red-brick and four stories high, probably about fifty years old. I parked on the opposite side of the street, got out of my car, and stared at the fire-blackened windows, some of which were boarded over. Yellow crime-scene tape stretched the width of the building, held in place by sawhorses strategically positioned on the sidewalk to prevent snoops like me from getting too close. Not that I’d let a detail like crime-scene tape stop me from taking a peek.

I crossed the street and ducked under the tape. I tried the double glass door, but found it locked. Inside, the lobby seemed relatively unscathed. Lots of grimy water and smoke-smudged walls, but no visible fire damage.

I turned and looked at the surrounding buildings. Office buildings, stores, a deli-style restaurant on the corner.

Hey, Ranger, are you out there?

Nothing. No psychic moment.

I ran back to the car, locked myself in, and hauled out my cell phone. I dialed Ranger’s number and waited through two rings before his answering machine picked up."
B0017DC5UC1,B0017DC5UC,"There was some slush on the street, and a layer of ice had accumulated on my windshield and my passenger-side windows. There was a large blurry object behind the window. I squinted through the ice. The blurry object was Joe Morelli.

Most women would have an orgasm on the spot to find Morelli sitting in their car. He had that effect. I’d known Morelli for most of my life, and I almost never had an on-the-spot orgasm, anymore. I needed at least four minutes.

He was wearing boots and jeans and a black fleece jacket. The tails of a red plaid flannel shirt hung under the jacket. Under the flannel shirt he wore a black T-shirt and a .40-caliber Glock. His eyes were the color of aged whiskey and his body was a testament to good Italian genes and hard work at the gym. He had a reputation for living fast, and the reputation was well deserved but dated. Morelli focused his energy on his job now.

I slid behind the wheel, turned the key in the ignition, and cranked up the defroster. I was driving a six-year-old blue Honda Civic that was perfectly good transportation but didn’t enhance my fantasy life. Hard to be Xena, Warrior Princess, in a six-year-old Civic."
B000OIZV4S0,B000OIZV4S,"Then the door to his compartment flew back as though blown open by a bomb, and two police officers burst inside.

VITORIA, SPAIN

SIX HUNDRED MILES to the west, in the Basque town of Vitoria, an Englishman sat amid the cool shadows of the Plaza de España, sipping coffee at a café beneath the graceful arcade. Though he was unaware of the events taking place in Zurich, they would soon alter the course of his well-ordered life. For now, his attention was focused on the bank entrance across the square.

He ordered another café con leche and lit a cigarette. He wore a brimmed hat and sunglasses. His hair had the healthy silver sheen of a man gone prematurely gray. His sandstone-colored poplin suit matched the prevailing architecture of Vitoria, allowing him to blend, chameleon-like, into his surroundings. He appeared to be entranced by that morning’s editions of El País and El Mundo. He was not.

On the pale yellow stonework a graffiti artist had scrawled a warning: TOURISTS BEWARE! YOU ARE NOT IN SPAIN ANY LONGER! THIS IS BASQUE COUNTRY! The Englishman did not feel any sense of unease. If for some reason he was targeted by the separatists, he was quite certain he would be able to look after himself."
B000OIZV4S1,B000OIZV4S,"Beneath it were two words: JUDEN SCHEISS.

THE tram took him directly to Hauptbahnhof. Inside the terminal, in an underground shopping arcade, he purchased an exorbitantly priced pair of Bally leather boots. Upstairs in the main hall he checked the departure board. A train was leaving for Munich in fifteen minutes. From Munich he could make an evening flight back to London, where he would go directly to Isherwood’s house in South Kensington and strangle him.

He purchased a first-class ticket and walked to the toilet. In a stall he changed from his loafers into the new boots. On the way out he dropped the loafers into a rubbish bin and covered them with paper towels.

By the time he reached the platform, the train was boarding. He stepped onto the second carriage and picked his way along the corridor until he came to his compartment. It was empty. A moment later, as the train eased forward, Gabriel closed his eyes, but all he could see was the dead man lying at the foot of the Raphael, and the two words scrawled on a streetcar: JUDEN SCHEISS.

The train slowed to a stop. They were still on the platform. Outside, in the corridor, Gabriel heard footfalls."
B01AWTXVWC0,B01AWTXVWC,"Mother and her defense mechanism stared at us. We squirmed under the scrutiny. My Caribbean cruise was off to a choppy start. First Jessica, now Mother, what next?

Probability Stateroom 704, all three thousand and eight hundred square feet of it, had one owner’s and two grand suites. In addition, there were crew quarters somewhere: one for the butler, one for the stateroom attendant, and one for the chef. The owner’s suite was (Bianca’s) mine. Fantasy and Mother were in the grand suites on the opposite end, a good jog away. Between all the suiteness were luxuriously appointed living spaces, including a totally private veranda that ran the length of 704 on the starboard side of the ship. The balconies were staggered from deck to deck, so we were the only ones with access to ours and no other passengers could see us. In the middle of the veranda, a pool. Behind the pool, a private sundeck. Each of the fifty suites on Probability were just as secluded as ours and had private pools. In spite of things not going quite swimmingly just yet, we had everything we could ever need or want for a fabulous vacation.

Let the fabulous part begin."
B01AWTXVWC1,B01AWTXVWC,"The promenade featured larger-than-life ice sculptures; I saw Neptune, Captain Jack Sparrow, and either one of the Weeki Wachee Springs mermaids or Morticia Addams. I couldn’t tell. Along the west wall were table games: poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, and baccarat. The east wall held a massive glass bar and plenty of luxurious lounging, the color scheme throughout was navy and silver, waterfall prism lights floated and twinkled above everything. The best part was in front of the bar. Back to back in two rows of twenty-five were the stars of the show— Probability’s slot machines — Knot On Your Life —one with (Bianca’s) my name on it.

I studied V2, wondering how to ask for a casino pit stop; might as well (avoid my mother) check it out on my way to the suite. I love casinos. But before I could talk myself into it or out of it, the elevator doors opened and spilled me out on Deck Seven. So I took the path I was destined for: Suite 704.

 The casino wasn’t going anywhere.

I had a whole week.

With my mother.

Standing at the door, I had no idea how to get in. I shook V2 trying to figure it out, but before I did I heard gear clicks and bolt slides. It opened."
B00X2FDZKW0,B00X2FDZKW,"The serving-women muttered that she could tame animals, dream the future, and summon rain.

PYOTR COLLECTED HIS OUTER CLOTHES and hung them near the oven. A practical man, he had always shrugged at rumors. But his wife sat so very still, looking into the fire. Only the flames moved, gilding her hand and throat. She made Pyotr uneasy. He paced the wooden floor.

Rus’ had been Christian ever since Vladimir baptized all of Kiev in the Dneiper and dragged the old gods through the streets. Still, the land was vast and changed slowly. Five hundred years after the monks came to Kiev, Rus’ still teemed with unknown powers, and some of them had lain reflected in the strange princess’s knowing eyes. The Church did not like it. At the bishops’ insistence, Marina, her only child, was married off to a boyar in the howling wilderness, many days’ travel from Moscow.

Pyotr often blessed his good fortune. His wife was wise as she was beautiful; he loved her and she him. But Marina never talked about her mother. Pyotr never asked. Their daughter, Olga, was an ordinary girl, pretty and obliging. They had no need for another, certainly not an heir to the rumored powers of a strange grandmother."
B00X2FDZKW1,B00X2FDZKW,"The walks between the outbuildings were roofed and floored with logs, defense against rain and snow and mud. But the sleet had come with the dawn, and the slanting wet had soaked the wood and frozen solid. The footing was treacherous, and the damp drifts loomed head-high, pockmarked with sleet. But Pyotr’s felt-and-fur boots were sure on the ice. He paused in the drowsing kitchen to ladle water over his slimy hands. Atop the oven, Alyosha turned over and whimpered in his sleep.

His wife’s room was small—in deference to the frost— but it was bright, and by the standards of the north, luxurious. Swaths of woven fabric covered the wooden walls. The beautiful carpet—part of Marina’s dowry—had come by long and circuitous roads from Tsargrad itself. Fantastic carving adorned the wooden stools, and blankets of wolf and rabbit skin lay scattered in downy heaps.

The small stove in the corner threw off a fiery glow. Marina had not gone to bed; she sat near the fire, wrapped in a robe of white wool, combing her hair. Even after four children, her hair was still thick and dark and fell nearly to her knee. In the forgiving firelight, she looked very like the bride that Pyotr had brought to his house so long ago."
B07BF9CNYR0,B07BF9CNYR,"so I could reestablish myself on the other side of the hedge. Cash flow problems had been part of what landed me in the fortress, but I planned to get back to my life as a vamp hunter for the Mercenary Guild as soon as I could.

I wracked my brain for a moment, trying to put a face to the name Gretchen. Then I remembered— she was a Guild merc about my age or a little older. Decent level of magical ability.

This happened sometimes—a mark would find a way to take refuge in Faerie, and if the merc assigned to the bounty wasn’t Fae, the merc was shit out of luck on the assignment. Or, the merc could find a Fae to help.

The cash would be good, but I wasn’t sure how the hell I’d fit in a merc job around everything going on in Faerie. I was at Marisol’s mercy, especially since I lived in the fortress full-time.

I went to the main fortress entrance, intending to go out and cross over to the other side of the hedge where my cell phone would work, but a couple of guards blocked my way.

I recognized both of them from my graduating class."
B07BF9CNYR1,B07BF9CNYR,"The man behind the counter went to a row of small boxes at the back wall, retrieved an envelope, and passed it to me through the window.

I turned it over, and noticing it was sealed—both in the regular sense and with a wax seal and an additional application of a wisp of magic—but not with Fae magic. This message was sealed with human magic from the Earthly realm.

Magic seals allowed a message to be opened only by the intended recipient. I slipped my finger under the chunk of wax and popped it open.

Inside was a note written in an unfamiliar scrawl. The first line caught my interest immediately.

Today’s your lucky day. You’ve been assigned to help a human merc track down her mark in Faerie, and you’ll earn half the bounty. More important, this will be your only route to reinstatement with the Guild. Contact Gretchen within the hour. Don’t screw this up.

There was a phone number written at the bottom, and the note was signed by my Mercenary Guild boss, Gus.

I perked up at the possibility of earning some side cash. I was saving for when Marisol released me from my obligations to the Stone Order"
B074ST4VCS0,B074ST4VCS,"Poornima was too busy with her charkha and the household chores to take over the second loom, her brothers and sister too small to reach the treadles, so her father began looking for help. He asked everyone he knew, he inquired at the tea shop he frequented in the evenings, he went to the weaving collective and announced he was willing to offer a quarter of the proceeds of every sari that was made, along with meals. There were no takers. Indravalli was a village composed mainly of sari makers, and most of the young men were busy helping their own families. The village was purportedly founded in the time of the Ikshvakus, and ever since, had been weaving cloth —in ancient times, clothing for the royal courts, but now simply the cotton saris worn by the peasantry and, occasionally, the intellectual elite. The Quit India Movement, along with the image of Gandhi sitting at his charkha, spinning, and his inception of the homespun ideal, had improved Indravalli’s prospects considerably, especially in the years leading up to independence. But now it was 2001, a new century, and the young men of Indravalli, those who were born into the caste of weavers, to which Poornima and her family also belonged, were struggling to feed their own families. In fact, many had abandoned weaving and taken up other occupations."
B074ST4VCS1,B074ST4VCS,"She left the dark hut, the broken charkha, and her mother, staring listlessly at the empty pots and pans, and wandered into the village. She walked past the huts of the laundresses and past the train station and past the tobacco shop and the dry goods shop and the sari shop and the tailoring shop and past even the Hanuman temple, in the middle of Indravalli, and found herself in front of the small gated opening to the weaving collective. She heard voices and the whirring of a fan. And just there, if she put her face to the gate, she could smell the faint aroma of new cloth, a mingling of freshly cooked rice and spring rain and teakwood and something of those hard seeds, so unwilling to let go. More captivating to her—this slight scent, lost so soon in the wind—than the most fragrant flower.

With hardly a thought, she opened the creaking gate with a firm grip and went inside.

* * *

Poornima’s father owned two looms. One was where he worked, and the other was where her mother had worked. They’d each taken two or three days to complete a sari, but now, with only one person at the loom, there were only half the number of saris. That meant half the money."
B06XNS3D9Y0,B06XNS3D9Y,"Janie huddled deeper into her coat. She kept her thoughts busy with what she learned that day in class as she joined the flow of people on the sidewalk. It was easy to be preoccupied with the information she had received in class that morning.

After seventeen years, cholera had returned to the United States.

Dr. Anderson had delivered the news that morning. The Atalanta, an English mail steamer, had sailed for New York from London on the tenth of October. She docked at Le Havre on the eleventh, and took aboard twenty-four cabin and five hundred forty steerage passengers. When she dropped anchor in New York’s lower bay in December, her master reported sixty cases of cholera and fifteen deaths.

The news was devastating. In spite of the fact that ships had increased in size and their passenger lists had doubled, they still did not provide quarantine. Medical and political considerations demanded the passengers be denied entrance to America. A hospital ship was hastily fitted out in the harbor. As soon as it was possible, all the passengers were transferred to it. She could only imagine the misery of the hundreds of people confined to what they surely knew was a death trap."
B06XNS3D9Y1,B06XNS3D9Y,"She could imagine the strain was adding up, but she made a mental note to go by the restaurant on the way home from school the next day so she could see for herself. She had gotten closer to them since moving to Philadelphia, counting on Opal to feed her before her housemates had joined her. She’d spent her whole life with housekeepers cooking for her. Even during the war, she had eaten most of her meals at Carrie’s house, with May doing all the cooking. She knew pitiful little about feeding herself. She felt no real motivation for that to change, not when there were people in the world like Opal to cook for her.

The women laughed and talked as they finished their pie, but Janie couldn’t rid herself of the worry niggling at the back of her mind. She was suddenly eager for tomorrow to arrive so she could visit Opal and Eddie.

Chapter Four

The weak sun did little to warm the frigid air as Janie made her way toward the restaurant. Clanging bells from streetcars, shouts from wagon drivers, and the steady clap of carriages filled the air. Record-breaking low temperatures seemed to have done little to slow activity in the city."
B079QBXDNP0,B079QBXDNP,"They headed north, slightly away from the setting sun. Behind and far below, the giant engines of the Pathfinder roared back to life. It swung to port and began steaming north.

Under the sound of the helicopter’s powerful thumping blades, Clay finished his conversation and removed his headset. He leaned against the door watching Palin. The man sat uncomfortably, with his hands still behind his back, eyes lowered at the floor. The marines watched him intently, with grips tight on their weapons. Palin looked smaller than before. He sat quietly and did not struggle. To Clay, he looked almost despondent.

Palin slowly lifted his head to look around the small cabin and the marines sitting around them. Their faces looked like chiseled stone. He looked at Clay and their eyes met. They maintained eye contact for a long time.

Clay could not help but notice something in Palin’s gaze. Outwardly, he looked small and helpless but, at the same time, his eyes revealed no fear. When Palin looked away, Clay turned his head away too and looked out the window. After a few minutes, the blue ocean ended and was quickly replaced by white sand beaches as the helicopters raced north along Florida’s Atlantic coastline.

* **"
B079QBXDNP1,B079QBXDNP,"Alison stepped up onto the walkway and turned back. Clay was nowhere to be seen, nor could she see the dolphin’s tank, far back on the stern. She took a deep breath and walked quickly across. Chris and Lee followed.

When all passengers were seated and counted, the plank was quickly removed. The engines roared to life, and the cutter pulled away. As they charged forward, the Pathfinder slowly shrank in the distance behind them. Alison leaned forward and caught sight of the helicopters approaching the Pathfinder’s bow. One large helicopter was accompanied by two smaller Apache attack choppers on each side.

Kathryn Lokke was sitting at her desk, but quickly stood up when she saw Phillip LeBlanc walk in. At nearly six feet tall and in his sixties, LeBlanc was the Secretary of the Interior and, in Kathryn’s opinion, one of the few honorable politicians left at his level. He was also her boss. Having run the USGS a few administrations prior, just before the wave of scandals, LeBlanc noticed Kathryn early in her scientific career and became a mentor. He was instrumental in her becoming the director of the USGS as the person who encouraged her, or pushed, as she recalled, to go for it."

B01BSNFR641,B01BSNFR64,"Tuck-in happened in a certain order, according to certain elaborate protocols, and on anyone’s birthday everyone slept in the same bed. They often observed Shabbat—as much in the sense of self-consciously witnessing religion as fulfilling it—with a Whole Foods challah, Kedem grape juice, and the tapered wax of endangered bees in the silver candleholders of extinct ancestors. After the blessings, and before eating, Jacob and Julia would go to each of the children, hold his head, and whisper into his ear something of which they were proud that week. The extreme intimacy of the fingers in the hair, the love that wasn’t secret but had to be whispered, sent tremors through the filaments of the dimmed bulbs.

After dinner, they performed a ritual whose origin no one could remember and whose meaning no one questioned: they closed their eyes and walked around their house. It was fine to speak, to be silly, to laugh, but their blindness always became silent. Over time, they developed a tolerance for the dark quiet and could last for ten minutes, then twenty. They would meet back at the kitchen table, and then open their eyes together. Each time it was revelatory. Two revelations: the foreignness of a home the children had lived in their entire lives, and the foreignness of sight."
B0713W44980,B0713W4498,"Bullet had started seeking me out first in the morning. I loved watching her ears bob, her broad muscled haunches ripple, as she trotted out in front of me. She was gentle as a kitten but people still crossed the street when they saw her anvil head coming. Queers and pit bulls have a certain species affinity: both feared and misunderstood, discarded by families, used for bait. Bullet was a rescue and she had her issues, but didn’t we all.

Summer was still asleep when I mounted my bike to head to work. The June sky was gray with patches of blue hope. The Broadway Bridge took me up and over the river and coasted me into downtown, where gutter punks and junkies fringed the nineteenth-century buildings of Old Town. Outside Artifacts I locked my bike to a telephone pole studded with staples and wet layers of flyers. I was late, but the store was still dark. I unlocked the front door and flipped on the lights. Paintings hung all the way to the ceiling in a tall, boxy space full of vintage furniture. Living rooms and dining rooms and bedrooms with no walls. Former lives arranged to sell. I wound through the store, turning on every lamp."
B0713W44981,B0713W4498,"Summer’s bag hit the floor with a soft thump and a moment later the shower whooshed on. I’d tell her. Just not yet. I feigned sleep until I slept. Dissembling has always come easily to me.

Jesus Had a Twin

MY CHIN WAS STILL RAW THE NEXT MORNING, ROSY AND TENDER as if I’d come in from the bitter cold. At the bathroom mirror I wiped away the shower’s blur and leaned in to close the vision gap. My black hair—naturally dark brown, but I dyed it black when I thought to—was toweled into floppy spikes, my brown eyes bleary, my skin winter-pale, and then here on my chin, this red badge of false courage. What had I been thinking? I hadn’t been. Not-thinking had seemed like a good idea at the time. I sneaked into Summer’s makeup and managed to powder over the scraped patch enough to mute the lurid glow, but it still stung to the touch.

The dog and I took a round through the neighborhood while Summer slept late."
B000FBJCJE0,B000FBJCJE,"In order to transmit the same amount of information on paper, they would have to arrange for a 747 cargo freighter packed with telephone books and encyclopedias to power-dive into their unit every couple of minutes, forever.

Hiro can’t really afford the computer either, but he has to have one. It is a tool of his trade. In the worldwide community of hackers, Hiro is a talented drifter. This is the kind of lifestyle that sounded romantic to him as recently as five years ago. But in the bleak light of full adulthood, which is to one’s early twenties as Sunday morning is to Saturday night , he can clearly see what it really amounts to: He’s broke and unemployed. And a few short weeks ago, his tenure as a pizza deliverer—the only pointless dead-end job he really enjoys—came to an end. Since then, he’s been putting a lot more emphasis on his auxiliary emergency backup job: freelance stringer for the CIC, the Central Intelligence Corporation of Langley, Virginia.

The business is a simple one. Hiro gets information. It may be gossip, videotape, audiotape, a fragment of a computer disk, a xerox of a document. It can even be a joke based on the latest highly publicized disaster.

He uploads it to the CIC database— the Library, formerly the Library of Congress, but no one calls it that anymore."
B000FBJCJE1,B000FBJCJE,"Beneath this image, it is possible to see Hiro’s eyes, which look Asian. They are from his mother, who is Korean by way of Nippon. The rest of him looks more like his father, who was African by way of Texas by way of the Army—back in the days before it got split up into a number of competing organizations such as General Jim’s Defense System and Admiral Bob’s National Security.

Four things are on the cargo pallet: a bottle of expensive beer from the Puget Sound area, which Hiro cannot really afford; a long sword known in Nippon as a katana and a short sword known as a wakizashi—Hiro’s father looted these from Japan after World War II went atomic—and a computer.

The computer is a featureless black wedge. It does not have a power cord, but there is a narrow translucent plastic tube emerging from a hatch on the rear, spiraling across the cargo pallet and the floor, and plugged into a crudely installed fiber-optics socket above the head of the sleeping Vitaly Chernobyl. In the center of the plastic tube is a hair-thin fiber-optic cable. The cable is carrying a lot of information back and forth between Hiro’s computer and the rest of the world."
B000JMKQX00,B000JMKQX0,"What was most puzzling was the cargo, still in their saddlebags, or just scattered about the bodies. Now, even if this wasn’t a territorial hit, even if it was a religious or tribal revenge killing, no one just abandons fifty kilos of prime, raw, Bad Brown,8 or perfectly good assault rifles, or expensive personal trophies like watches, mini disc players, and GPS locaters.

The blood trail led up the mountain path from the massacre in the wadi. A lot of blood. Anyone who lost that much wouldn’t be getting up again. Only somehow he did. He hadn’t been treated. There were no other track marks. From what we could tell, this man had run, bled, fallen facedown—we still could see his bloody face-mark imprinted in the sand. Somehow, without suffocating, without bleeding to death, he’d lain there for some time, then just gotten up again and started walking. These new tracks were very different from the old. They were slower, closer together. His right foot was dragging, clearly why he’d lost his shoe, an old, worn-out Nike high-top. The drag marks were sprinkled with fluid. Not blood, not human, but droplets of hard, black, crusted ooze that none of us recognized. We followed these and the drag marks to the entrance of the cave."
B000JMKQX01,B000JMKQX0,"There were scratch marks down the side of his face, and his eyes had that frantic fire I was starting to see more of every day. The driver’s eyes had a different look, the same one as me, the look that maybe money wasn’t going to be much good for much longer. I slipped the man an extra fifty and wished him luck. That was all I could do.

Where was the truck headed?

Kyrgyzstan.

METEORA, GREECE

[The monasteries are built into the steep, inaccessible rocks, some buildings sitting perched atop high, almost vertical columns. While originally an attractive refuge from the Ottoman Turks, it later proved just as secure from the living dead. Postwar staircases, mostly metal or wood, and all easily retractable, cater to the growing influx of both pilgrims and tourists. Meteora has become a popular destination for both groups in recent years. Some seek wisdom and spiritual enlightenment, some simply search for peace. Stanley MacDonald is one of the latter. A veteran of almost every campaign across the expanse of his native Canada, he first encountered the living dead during a different war, when the Third Battalion of Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry was involved in drug interdiction operations in Kyrgyzstan.]"
B015RR2C4C0,B015RR2C4C,"Libby put the phone down. Too restless to go back to the spoiled meringue, she climbed the stairs to the bathroom. A hot bath might relax her.

She tried to unwind by reading a magazine, but her mind drifted away to the image of Susie Bennett, drenched and cold, slipping sideways in dreadful slow motion. The scene played over and over in her head, like a YouTube video on a never-ending loop.

It was no good. She stepped out of the bath. How could she leave it at that? If the police weren’t going to try to discover the truth, Libby would find out for herself. Was Susie’s death really an accident, or something much worse?

Fuzzy’s Disgrace

The early morning sun peeped, pink and coy, over the horizon, as though the past two days of storms and wind belonged to another era. Libby walked Shipley along the beach in the opposite direction from the lighthouse. She wasn’t ready to repeat yesterday’s disastrous trip.

A dozen fishermen, with all the time in the world, leaned against the sea wall, rods extended into an ebbing tide. They nodded, mumbling a greeting as Libby passed. George Edwards wrapped a fish in newspaper."
B015RR2C4C1,B015RR2C4C,"A brown ankle boot encased one foot, but the other was bare, the expensive footwear long gone. The woman’s lips were fuller than nature intended. Cosmetic work in the recent past? Drenched hair half-concealed a small, neat face with a turned-up nose. A line of darker hair, along a parting on the side of the head, suggested highlights; a proper salon job, not a do-it-yourself.

Libby peered into the pools of water left stranded under the lighthouse, looking for a handbag, hoping for clues, but the sea had taken that as well.

I shouldn’t touch the body again. Libby knew the rules: everyone did. Don’t disturb the scene. They were still alone. She ought to wait for the police to arrive, but something about the woman’s arm, tucked at such an awkward angle into a jacket pocket, nagged at Libby. It wouldn’t do any harm just to give it another small nudge, surely?

She twitched the sleeve. The arm jerked. Libby gulped, then took a slow breath. It was just rigor mortis. She pulled again, harder. The stiff hand popped out of the pocket, rigid, fingers pointing to the bleak, wide Somerset sky, and a chunk of plastic tumbled from the jacket. Libby whispered,"
B01N27HHZT0,B01N27HHZT,"He had considered the delivery a badge of honor, and actually hated to wash up afterward. It was, after all, the crown of the veterinary profession—this giving a hand to life, to breath. Hal had trusted him to do it —a little anxious, maybe, but counting on the kid to get the thing done.

Hal, who was pretty much a hero to him, was now retired from his full-time practice and working part-time at the Kavanagh clinic. The clinic had also been able to retain Blake Eddistoe, Hal’s longtime vet tech, and their receptionist, Amanda, who was also totally competent at everything else.

It was a perfect setup. Even Joanna Rivers’s vet practice a few miles north was a benefit. Joanna didn’t have the mobility constraints or expenses of bricks and mortar; she had a truck and equipment and was good to go wherever needed. Most of Hal’s former clients had turned their large farm animals over to Joanna, which took a potential strain off the Kavanagh clinic.

Still, a few of Hal’s old clients continued to haul in the occasional donkey, goat, or llama. Just last week he’d gone out to a horse trailer in the driveway and treated a mule—a fungus infection requiring a thorough hoof swab and a shot."
B01N27HHZT1,B01N27HHZT,"He and Lace had it all, but they’d invested nearly all to have this life. Things would be plenty tight for a year or two.

After college and vet school and the hard separations from Lace and the long process of acquiring Meadowgate from his mentor, Hal Owen, and jumping through hoops for the adoption agency . . . after all that, there was this: his wife of three and a half months, their four-year-old foster son, Jack Tyler, his new practice, a payroll, the cattle, their farmhouse, a hundred acres . . .

Unreal.

And the dream had taken shape right here. He had come out to Meadowgate nearly every summer since he was eleven years old. This is where he had read and reread everything James Herriot had written, and pored over old editions of Beef Cattle Science. It’s where he’d watched the birthing of calves and lambs, colts and piglets, pups and kittens, and given a hand to Hal in more than one crisis.

He remembered the blood on his hands from the emergency delivery of a bull calf turned crossways in the birth canal. He was fourteen, and had helped a living being come into the world."
B01CO4AVC60,B01CO4AVC6,"But their numbers bled away every night while the Color Prince added to his.

Karris’s war wasn’t going to be fought on battlefields. It was up to her to give the people of the Seven Satrapies reasons to fight, to bleed, to die, and to kill. Others would be the sword in this fight. She would be the lash and the pen.

She must unite the Seven Satrapies for this war. Any who opposed that goal, who opposed her, must be brought into line or crushed.

There was a knock on the door, and the now omnipresent Blackguards announced Andross Guile. He was only the first test.

Lovely to be starting out easy.

Andross Guile looked as if he had purloined all the youth Karris had lost in the last few months. It wasn’t only that his little round paunch was shrinking, or that his skin, formerly pallid from being so long covered from the sun’s gaze, was taking on color again. His back was straight, his head high, showing the broad Guile shoulders and strong Guile jaw. He was energized by crisis.

A good man for these times, then.

And that’s the first and last time I’ll ever think of Andross Guile as a good man."
B01CO4AVC61,B01CO4AVC6,"Determine if each one is loyal to me or to Marissia still.

Shift all monies to new accounts.

Determine how much Marissia has stolen, if possible. How? By leaning on Turgal Onesto? The young banking scion will have the opportunity to prove his worth now.

The only good news was that regardless of how high she’d climbed, Marissia was still a slave. Her clipped ear meant she would have trouble keeping power if she didn’t have money. Money. Money’s the answer for that snake.

But all this was recovery. All this was merely treading water after a shipwreck. That wasn’t enough. Karris needed to swim for shore.

She was the White now. That meant all the drafters in the Seven Satrapies were her responsibility. It meant the Chromeria and Big and Little Jasper were her responsibility. Taking care of those meant that the physical, brute-force weapons she’d loved for so long were inadequate to the task before her.

She had to win the war.

Win the war.

She made it an item on her list, as if something so immense might be better comprehended if she wrestled it into words.

Winning battles wouldn’t suffice. By sheer numbers killed, the Seven Satrapies had won battles."
B07B8X67HP0,B07B8X67HP,"So, I’ll tell him tonight then…

I can already feel my resolve withering, though. Getting up the courage to tell him was hard enough the first time.

I throw a tip down on the table. Unnecessary since we ordered nothing, but I consider it space rent.

There’s really nothing to do at this point but go back to the Golden Gun.

Maybe Percy will have some ideas.

I mean, she’ll definitely have ideas, but maybe she’ll have a good one, too.

I start in that direction, bypassing the motorcycle as I go.

Maybe walking will clear my head.

Of course, walking doesn’t really help, but at least I won’t run the risk of crashing. The way I’m feeling right now, it’s best not to operate heavy machinery.

I navigate the streets of Bangkok with relative ease now. This area, at least, is one I know. This is a good thing, because I’m so deep in thought, my body is functioning solely on auto-pilot.

By the time I reach the Golden Gun, I’m no closer to a solution.

Still, I smile as I walk into the room, seeing the gang all there.

It seems like no matter how shitty things get, their presence always helps."
B07B8X67HP1,B07B8X67HP,"I’ve made up my mind, though.

Now I just need to get my body to comply.

I’ve made some mistakes in the last twenty-four hours—to put it lightly.

Mistakes that I’ll just have to learn to live with.

Keeping them a secret from Eggs, however, is one mistake too many. So I’ve decided to come clean.

To unburden myself, as they say.

The fact that I’ll just be transferring the burden onto him isn’t lost on me. But it’s a hell of a lot better than the alternative.

I can’t lie to him for the rest of our lives.

I dismount the bike, legs shaking as I do, and head for the restaurant like a woman bound for the gallows.

This is going to hurt.

I don’t slow, though, not even to take a breath. If I pause now, I may never find the courage to continue.

Instead, I pull the door open, heading towards my fiancé and the toughest conversation of my life.

Eggs looks up from his phone the moment I enter the room, a strange, almost quizzical expression on his face.

I assume it’s due to my little disappearing act.

He doesn’t know the half of it."
B01J1P40640,B01J1P4064,"in order to claim his title, had he not felt the urge for a hard ride after spending days locked in a carriage, he would never even have met her!

And what a tragedy that would have been! A tragedy he wouldn’t even have been aware of!

Never before had he laid eyes on a woman who managed to stir his soul with a single curl to her lips. A woman who challenged him. A woman he could see riding by his side.

Chuckling, Connor nodded his head to her before he reluctantly kicked his gelding and they sped off down the drive.

Still, despite her unusual allure, Connor couldn’t help but wonder how he had ever fallen for that twig of a girl!

* **

A shiver ran down Henrietta’s back that echoed into every fibre of her being as that man’s soul-searching eyes swept over her, touching places that were quite improper for him to notice.

He was a stranger, a foreigner even, and yet, he acted as though they were intimately acquainted. Very intimately.

When his black beast sped down the drive, Henrietta’s eyes stayed with them until they disappeared from view, and she wondered if she would ever see him again."
B01J1P40641,B01J1P4064,"However, when he pulled up the reins, a curtain was pulled back from one of the windows in the parlour and before he knew what was happening, clear, blue eyes looked into his.

Angry, blue eyes, to be exact.

Connor could not hide a smile as he saw the confusion on her face as she searched his, clearly worrying about why he had come and possibly how he had found her.

A part of him wanted to go to her and lay everything open; however, he knew she would be furious and not yield easily. Better leave that to her uncle. He would speak to her later and explain himself…when they were alone.

As she stood by the window, glaring down at him, Connor’s eyes swept over her, comparing what he saw to the memory he treasured. While the deep azure gown accented her eyes, it also made her look pale; however, part of that could possibly be attributed to the shock at seeing him invading her home. Although he had often pictured her in his thoughts with her hair flowing over her shoulders, Connor thought he liked her better with her hair pinned up, revealing her graceful neck.

Holding her gaze, he marvelled at the twists and turns of fate. Had his father not died when he had, had Connor not been delayed to travel to England"
B06XTXGJMK0,B06XTXGJMK,"He’d dreamed of returning from Blackwood Abbey and presenting himself to his father in triumph, proving he’d become every inch a man and more. He’d longed for it, that sense of revenge.

And yet he’d fought it, too. The world might believe him to be the devil he’d been called, but a part of him, buried deep within the recesses of his own heart, wanted to prove he was different from Silas Blackbourne; that the evil in the old man’s mind hadn’t warped his, as well.

It had, of course. How could it not? A ten-year-old boy sent to live in the wilds of northern England for something he couldn’t control? How a parent could simply rid themselves of a child like that, Damon didn’t know. He himself had grown quite attached to the cook’s daughter, the little girl he’d held when she was just a babe. He’d watched her grow up, moving from winsome toddler to young schoolgirl, delighting in her milestones along with her mother. He missed her, that young girl, and she wasn’t even his child. How could his parents have sent him away?

He knew their answer. Knew his father had been convinced Damon was possessed, had had an evil in him."
B06XTXGJMK1,B06XTXGJMK,"mirrors to his, flashed at him as he descended the stairs. It was always a shock to see her; were she not obviously much younger, she and he might have been mistaken for twins.

Thank goodness he had taken after his mother in looks. Had he looked like his father, that big barrel of a Viking descendant, nightmares would have dogged him every time he looked in the mirror. Cassie had their father’s blonde locks, but her blue eyes spoke of their mother’s influence. Those ice-blue eyes were considered a hallmark of the family, for all four of the Blackbourne siblings had them.

These two women are why I am here.

Damon descended the stairs, the side of his mouth cocked up in his customary grin. He had missed them in his own way. What would it have been like to grow up together? To have had a family he could count on? Though these past months had allowed them to get to know each other, the connection was too new for him to put much faith in it.

Cassie had had her first Season two years ago at eighteen, but she’d refused every offer because she wanted to wait for her sister, who was two years her junior."
B01IA6FM760,B01IA6FM76,"(Francie wasn’t there, his stomach hurt, and his other cousins barely talked to him), but he assumed that everyone else was having a good time. After the festivities ended, however, as he and his parents were on their way home in the blue car, he was caught by surprise when his mother started bad-mouthing Uncle Lew to his father. He couldn’t follow everything she said, but the anger in her voice was unusually harsh, a bitter harangue that seemed to have something to do with his uncle owing his father money, and how dare Lew splurge on Cadillacs and mink coats before paying his father back. His father took it calmly at first, but then he raised his voice, which was something that almost never happened, and suddenly he was barking at Ferguson’s mother to stop, telling her that Lew didn’t owe him anything, that it was his brother’s money and he could do anything he goddamned pleased with it. Ferguson knew his parents sometimes argued (he could hear their voices through the wall of their bedroom), but this was the first time they had fought a battle in front of him, and because it was the first time, he couldn’t help feeling that something fundamental about the world had changed."
B01IA6FM761,B01IA6FM76,"His father’s oldest brother had suffered his ups and downs as a gambler over the years, consistently losing more than he won but winning just enough to keep himself from drowning, and now, with the smart money all on Cleveland, it would have made sense for him to follow the herd, but the Giants were his team, he had been pulling for them through good seasons and bad since the early twenties, and for once he decided to ignore the odds and bet with his heart rather than his brain. Not only did he put his money on the underdogs but he wagered they would win four in a row, a hunch so preposterous and delusional that his bookie gave him odds of 300 to 1, which meant that for the modest sum of two hundred dollars, the sharp-dressing Lew Ferguson walked off with a pot of gold, sixty grand, an enormous amount back in those days, a fortune. The haul was so spectacular, so startling in its ramifications, that Uncle Lew and Aunt Millie invited everyone to their house for a party, a celebratory blowout with champagne, lobster, and thick porterhouse steaks that featured a viewing of Millie’s new mink coat and a spin around the block in Lew ’s new white Cadillac. Ferguson was out of sorts that day"
B01ER6Z7RI0,B01ER6Z7RI,"anyway—not only allowed me to concentrate on my career, but it also meant I seldom had to take care of London on my own, so I never really learned how challenging it could be. Because Vivian made it look easy, I thought it was easy for her, but over time, Vivian became moodier and more irritable. Basic household chores also took a backseat, and I often came home to a living room littered from wall to wall with toys and a kitchen sink filled with dirty dishes. Laundry piled up, carpets weren’t vacuumed, and because I’ve always disliked a messy house, I eventually decided to bring someone in twice a week to clean. During London’s toddler years, I added a babysitter three afternoons a week to give Vivian a break during the day and I began watching London on Saturday mornings, so Vivian could have some Me Time. My hope was that she would have more energy for us as a couple again. To my mind, it seemed that my wife had begun to define herself as Vivian and a mother and that the three of us together were a family, but that being a wife and part of a couple had gradually become an inconvenience to her."
B01ER6Z7RI1,B01ER6Z7RI,"She was conscientious and loving, a natural nurse unfazed by diarrhea or vomit, and a model of patience. Vivian read London hundreds of books and could play on the floor for hours; the two of them went to parks and the library, and the sight of Vivian pushing London in a jogger-stroller was a common one in our neighborhood. There were other activities and scheduled playdates with neighborhood kids, preschool classes, and the usual doctors’ and dentists’ appointments, which meant that the two of them were always on the go. And yet when I think back on those first years of London’s life, the image of Vivian that most comes to mind is the expression of absolute joy on her face, whether holding London or watching our daughter gradually discover the world. Once when London was about eight months old and sitting in the high chair, she happened to sneeze. For whatever reason, London found that highly amusing and began to laugh; I offered a fake sneeze, and London’s laughter became uncontrollable. While I found the experience delightful, for Vivian, it was more. The love she felt for our daughter eclipsed everything else, even the love she felt for me.

The all-consuming nature of motherhood—or Vivian’s view of it,"
B000FC2K7E0,B000FC2K7E,"He let out a long breath, spoke silently to himself, the teacher lecturing the recruit. Calm down. Focus to the front. His eye flicked, caught some movement, and he froze again, the voice in his head silent. He stared again, the shadows dancing, then motionless, a trick of the eye. He tried to see the barbed wire, cursed silently. How can I see anything? Dammit! They could be pouring through, a hundred men, right in front of me. If they’re quiet, I won’t know until they’re right here, crawling over the sandbags! He held tight to his breathing, the voice in his head again: Barbed wire, you bloody idiot. Bells. You’ll hear the bells. He blinked hard, his eyes suddenly watering. No! He wiped with his sleeve, fought the blurriness. His eyes locked on the blackness again, the strain now slicing through his skull, dull pain working up the back of his neck. He massaged the ache with his hand, blinked again, could feel cramps creeping into his feet, his legs. He tried to flex his knees, ease the tightness, the voice shouting at him: Greenie! Do your duty! Behind him, another voice, soft, and he ignored it, thought, All right! I can do this!"
B000FC2K7E1,B000FC2K7E,"The barbed wire. It was the first time he had seen no-man’s-land, but there was really nothing to see. He held his eyes wide, tried hard not to blink, heard nothing but the quick thumping in his ears, his own heartbeat. He took a deep breath, tried to calm himself, every part of him straining to see and hear something, anything. Long minutes passed, the anticipation eating at him, his hands gripped tightly around the rifle. His foot moved slightly, touched the row of Mills bombs at his feet, and he rehearsed it in his mind, the sound of the bell, watching a large hulking shadow moving close, waiting for Duke to move first, to be sure. Then, one motion, reach down, grip the bomb, pull the pin, fling the bomb up and over the sandbags. His heart was racing again, come on! I can do this! I’m ready! He felt as awake as he had ever been, his eyes like two searchlights, probing the dark, any movement, his ears catlike, ready for any small sound. He could hear breathing, not his own, and his heart jumped, his body frozen, focused, realized now it was Duke, only a few feet away."
B001GUXJQU0,B001GUXJQU,"A minute later he moved out from the cover of the bushes and made it quietly to the back door. He slipped off his muddy boots and set them next to the door. He didn’t want to leave traces of his visit. Good private investigators were invisible. Lee held the light under his arm while he inserted the pick in the door lock and activated the device.

He used the pick gun partly for speed and partly because he didn’t crack enough locks to be that proficient at it. A pick and tension tool required constant use to allow the fingers the level of sensitivity required to detect the proximity of the shear line, the subtle descent of the tension tool as the lock’s tumblers began to do their little jig. Using a pick and tension tool, an experienced locksmith could pick the lock faster than Lee could with his pick gun. It was a true art and Lee knew his limitations. Soon, he felt the deadbolt sliding back.

When he eased open the door, the silence was broken by the low beeping sound of the security system. He quickly found the control pad, punched in six numbers and the beeping sound immediately stopped. As Lee closed the door softly behind him, he knew he was now a felon."
B001GUXJQU1,B001GUXJQU,"He would see it through at least until something happened to make him change his mind. And Lee could run very fast when he needed to.

Getting into the house wouldn’t be all that difficult, particularly since Lee had the pass-code. He’d managed to get it the third time he’d been here, when the two people had come to the cottage. He had already confirmed the place was wired, so he had come prepared. He had beat the couple here and waited while they did whatever they were doing inside. When they had come out, the woman had entered the pass-code to arm the system. Lee, hiding in the same copse he was in now, just happened to have a bit of electronic wizardry that snatched that code right out of the air like a fly ball neatly falling into a glove. All electrical current produces a magnetic field, like a little transmitter. When the tall woman had punched in the numbers, the security system had thrown off a discrete signal for each digit, right into Lee’s electronic mitt.

Lee checked the cloud cover once more, slapped on a pair of latex gloves with reinforced fingertip and palm pads, readied his flashlight and took another deep breath."
B06XFKXS1J0,B06XFKXS1J,"He sat in on meetings all day, and met with the two founders again before dinner to discuss his impressions, and they were pleased with what they heard. He added balance to the team, and he had a solid financial point of view. The meetings on Friday were even better. He liked the working environment as well. They were occupying a remodeled warehouse south of Market that had been made into offices, and they already had a fleet of young people working for them, full of dynamic ideas and energy. It was invigorating and exciting just being there, compared to what he did every day, although the concepts weren’t entirely unfamiliar to him. Undeniably there was risk, but everyone involved seemed sensible and experienced. They were a surprisingly cohesive group, and Blake fit right in. They renewed their offer to him before he left, more convinced than ever that he was the right man for the job, and he was too. They had managed to dissipate all his reservations about it in two days. He sat staring into space, lost in thought, and wide awake for most of the flight back to New York. It was the best forty-eight hours he had spent at work in years. He felt like a new man."
B06XFKXS1J1,B06XFKXS1J,"Both were younger than he was by a dozen years, and had impressive track records and histories. He knew they were originally geeks and had become brilliant businessmen. Both were Harvard MBAs. They were idea men who liked starting companies, selling them, and moving on. They wanted him to run the company while they developed the concept to its fullest until they sold it or it went public, whichever was most lucrative. They had all the money they needed to make it a success, and listening to their plans was as thrilling as he’d feared it would be, once he knew who was involved.

He couldn’t sleep that night, and had a breakfast meeting the next day with the half dozen people who headed up various departments. They were all innovative men and women who’d had successful roles in other companies. The two founders wanted only stars involved, and considered that Blake could be one as CEO, and they liked that he had both feet on the ground. Their business plan was almost flawless, and the opportunity to make a vast amount of money was immense, especially for Blake, as CEO, with the stock options and participation they were offering him."
B00PSFI5FY0,B00PSFI5FY,"If asked he’d have probably said that things were back to normal with us, but it was far from normal for me.

He reached for my hand and held it the whole journey. He'd been making a huge effort all week, but I still felt cold to his touch.

The children were sitting across the aisle from us. Every time we went round a bend Emma squealed with delight, grabbing hold of Jacob, who laughed hysterically at his big sister. Everyone in the entire carriage cracked up laughing at them too.

We walked from the train station at Camden Town. The wind had picked up a bit, but it was still warm. By the time we arrived at the zoo's entrance, in Regents Park, we were sweltering hot.

We got in a queue behind a busload of Japanese tourists. Michael groaned, rolled his eyes, and looked at his watch. But the well-organised tour guides cleared the crowds, getting us through the gates and in front of the reptile house within a few minutes.

The one and only time I'd been to the zoo was as a schoolgirl with my class. I could still remember my excitement at seeing all the fantastic wild animals I'd only read about in books."
B00PSFI5FY1,B00PSFI5FY,"It was obvious that something was very wrong, but I'd ignored it, hoping things would settle down again.

Now I knew the reason for his attitude, and I can't say I was too surprised.

Just last night, before we left home, Michael called me an embarrassment, because I’d refused to change out of my jeans. If dinner or a dance— the theatre even—had been our destination, then fair enough. But we were going to a house party, for Christ's sake, not a bloody fashion show.

In the cab on the way there, he'd sulked like a spoiled brat and continued to be horrible until we arrived at his friend's house. Then, as though someone had flipped a switch, my moody husband turned into Prince Charming once again.

Most women he met hung off his every word. To think that those same tired old lines had hooked me once upon a time—not anymore though.

His smarmy, cheesy patter worked a treat, especially on women of a certain age, but he'd always insisted flirting was as far as he ever went. And although I'd had my suspicions in the past, I'd never thought he would have the gall to do it right under my nose."
B00FJ352U60,B00FJ352U6,"The sisters debated this for a long time, both wary of proving their friends and family right by erupting in an argument on their first afternoon. Eventually, Malorie agreed to a coin toss, which ended in Shannon’s favor, an event Malorie still believes was somehow fixed.

Now, today, Malorie is not thinking about the little things her sister does that drive her batty. She is not quietly cleaning up after Shannon, closing cabinet doors, following her trail of sweaters and socks through the halls. She is not huffing, passively, shaking her head as she runs the dishwasher or slides one of Shannon’s unpacked boxes from the center of the living room, where it’s in both of their way. Instead, she is standing before the mirror in the first-floor bathroom, where she is naked, as she studies her belly in the glass.

You’ve missed a period before, she tells herself. But this is hardly consolation, because she has been anxious for weeks now, knowing she should have been safer with Henry Martin.

Her black hair hangs to her shoulders. Her lips curl down in a curious frown. She places her hands on her flat belly and nods slowly. No matter how she explains herself, she feels pregnant."
B00FJ352U61,B00FJ352U6,"Still, it’s difficult not to imagine the worst. What if someone else got to it first? Another woman, not unlike herself, living five houses in the other direction, using every day of four years to gather enough courage to flee. A woman who once stumbled down this same slippery bank and felt the same point of salvation, the pointed steel tip of the rowboat.

The air nips at the scratches on Malorie’s face. The children do not complain.

This is not childhood, Malorie thinks, leading them toward the river.

Then she hears it. Before reaching the dock, she hears the rowboat rocking in the water. She stops and checks the children’s blindfolds, tightening both. She leads them onto the wood planks.

Yes, she thinks, it’s still here. Just like the cars are still parked in the street outside their house. Just like the homes on the street are still empty.

It is colder, out of the woods, away from the house. The sound of the water is as frightening as it is exhilarating. Kneeling where she believes the boat must be, she lets go of the children’s hands and feels for the steel tip. Her fingertips find the rope that holds it first."
B072BFNTFS0,B072BFNTFS,"His eyes were shut, but even in the dark, I could see the shadows under them. It would’ve taken hours for the pain to subside enough for him to fall asleep.

I didn’t want to risk waking him by staying in the house and turning on the coffee machine, but I also didn’t want to face the day without a second coffee. I left a note saying I’d be nearby when he was ready for breakfast. Then I returned to the street below and remembered Connor had dropped me off. No car.

Figuring Zac wouldn’t mind my taking his, I called Harper to see if she was free for a break. She started at six a.m., so I thought she’d be about due for one, and I wanted to find out whether Connor had really asked her for date advice. The thought made me grin all over again.

Zac’s red BMW started up with a quiet purr, and I edged it out of the garage onto the street.

A block away from Harper’s mechanic workshop, I got a phone call and pulled over to answer it. It was an unknown number, and I wondered if it might be Zac from the landline in his loft."
B072BFNTFS1,B072BFNTFS,"Zachariah’s one-bedroom loft home was set above a double garage and studio space and was modest by A-list celebrity standards. Notwithstanding the infinity pool in the backyard where he liked to do forty laps every morning. More excitingly for me, it housed a real coffee machine. That alone was enough to make Zac a wonderful client in my books.

I knocked, then let myself in as I always did. Inside was dim and quiet. No lights. No television nor hum of the coffee machine. Zac must still be in bed recovering from that awful migraine. At least that’s what I was hoping. While they tended to last just a few hours, he’d told me they could last as long as twenty-four.

Not wanting to make any noise, I took off my shoes and tiptoed to the bedroom. While I waited for my eyes to adjust to the inky interior, my ears strained to pick up any signs of life. I was reassured to hear quiet, rhythmic breathing.

As long as it was Zac’s breathing.

When I could make out shapes sufficiently to avoid bumping into anything, I drew closer. Despite logic, my own pep talks, and the breathing thing, relief washed over me when I spotted him in the bed, his chest rising and falling."
B079MHDBZ20,B079MHDBZ2,"In fact, it meant remarkable prestige at a young age, it meant economic security, it meant leaving Pisa, it meant escaping a political and cultural climate that for months, I don’t know why, had exasperated him. It meant finally that in the fall, or at the beginning of the next year, we would get married and I would leave Naples. No one mentioned this last thing, instead they all congratulated Pietro and me. Even Nino, who right afterward looked at his watch, made some acerbic remarks on university careers, and exclaimed that he was sorry but he had to go.

We all got up. I didn’t know what to do, I uselessly sought his gaze, as a great sorrow filled my heart. End of the evening, missed opportunity, aborted desires. Out on the street I hoped that he would give me a phone number, an address. He merely shook my hand and wished me all the best. From that moment it seemed to me that each of his gestures was deliberately cutting me off. As a kind of farewell I gave him a half smile, waving my hand as if I were holding a pen. It was a plea, it meant: you know where I live, write to me, please. But he had already turned his back."
B079MHDBZ21,B079MHDBZ2,"It would have been difficult to tell him that my dark face, my muteness, could be explained precisely by the fact that he hadn’t remained completely absent, that he had intruded between me and Nino.

Nino, meanwhile, was making me even more unhappy. He was sitting next to me but didn’t address a word to me. He seemed happy about Pietro’s arrival. He poured wine for him, offered him cigarettes, lighted one, and now they were both smoking, lips compressed, and talking about the difficult journey by car from Pisa to Milan, and the pleasure of driving. It struck me how different they were: Nino thin, lanky, his voice high and cordial; Pietro thick-set, with the comical tangle of hair over his large forehead, his broad cheeks scraped by the razor, his voice always low. They seemed pleased to have met, which was unusual for Pietro, who was generally reserved. Nino pressed him, showing a real interest in his studies (I read an article somewhere in which you compare milk and honey to wine and every form of drunkenness), and urging him to talk about them, so that my fiancé, who tended not to talk about his subject, gave in, he corrected good-humoredly, he opened up. But just when Pietro was starting to gain confidence, Adele interrupted."

Along another part of the hallway, sitting on the boxy gray-carpeted seating built into the wall, were three hookers, working teens of the night. A variety pack: one black, one Asian, one white , they waited their turn before justice. The Asian looked nervous, probably needing a calming smoke or the sting of a needle. The others were vets, Fiske knew. They strolled, sat, showed some thigh, the jiggle of breast occasionally when some good old boys or young turks prowled by. Why miss some business over a little court thing? This was America, after all.

Fiske took the elevator down and was just passing by the metal detector and X-ray machine, standard equipment in virtually every courthouse these days, when Bobby Graham approached him, an unlit cigarette in his hand. Fiske liked the man neither personally nor professionally. Graham selected cases for prosecution based on the size of the headlines they would garner for him. And he never took on a case he would have to work real hard to win. The public doesn’t like prosecutors who lose."
B000SEFOKO1,B000SEFOKO,"Fiske looked at one group of young black men, crewcuts so severe they looked bald, pants pushed down to the crotch, boxers showing, puffy gang jackets, bulky tennies with no laces. Their open defiance of the criminal justice system was clear; they were imperiously sulky in their sameness.

These young men crowded around their attorney, a white guy, office-chunky, sweaty, expensive pinstripe soiled at the cuffs, slick-skinned loafers on his feet, horn-rim glasses twisting a little as he hammered home a point to his scout troop. He banged his fist into his meaty palm as the young black men, abdominals racked under their silk drug-trove shirts, listened intently, the only time they figured they would need this man, would bother to even look at him other than with contempt, or through a gun sight. Until the next time they needed him. And they would. In this building, he was magic. Here Michael Jordan could not touch this white man. They were Lewis and Clark. He was their Sacajewea. Shout the mystical words, Sac. Don’t let them do us.

Fiske knew what the suit was saying, knew it as if he could read the man’s lips. The man specialized in defending gang members on any crime they cared to commit. The best strategy: stone silence. Seen nothing, heard nothing, remembered nothing. Gunshots? Car backfire, most likely."

Putrid anger boiled over. Delta didn’t take prisoners. And neither did the former Baathists. Loyalists. Republican Guard hard core. And then came the infiltration and influence of the Iranians. Quds.

Reznick, Jerry, and other Special Forces soldiers had seen it all. The torture victims found dead. Bound and gagged. Eyes missing, limbs hacked off, gunshot wounds to the back of the head. Bodies thrown off buildings. On and on.

Jerry stirred for a few moments before drifting back into a fitful sleep. The embers of the fire were still burning.

Reznick sat in silence and stared at the flames.

Four

Just before dawn, headlights shone through the blinds of Reznick’s house.

As Jerry slept, Reznick drew his 9mm Beretta, pulled back the slide, and headed out the rear of the house. He crept around his home and down the side path. He spotted one SUV and an ambulance. He approached the SUV and yanked open the passenger door.

A middle-aged woman with a black bob haircut wearing bright-red lipstick stared at him, unfazed. Two heavyset men occupied the rear seats.

Reznick pressed the gun to the woman’s head."
B074CC429S1,B074CC429S,"Reznick sipped the scalding coffee, enjoying the caffeine buzz. A few more gulps washed down a Dexedrine, his drug of choice to keep him awake and alert.

The night wore on. He wondered if he should do something more worthwhile. Read a book, write an email to his daughter, watch an old movie. But he didn’t.

It was plain as day—his blood brother was starting to lose his grip on reality. Jerry needed someone to watch over him. Reznick thought back to the countless times he’d grabbed thirty minutes or maybe an hour in the night as they’d hunkered down in some shithole in Iraq. Jerry had watched over him like he’d watched over Jerry. That was the way it was. The firefights. The search-and-destroy missions in Baghdad. Fallujah. The ensuing mayhem. The deaths. And the seemingly constant suicide bombings. Both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State used that tactic to take strategic villages. The effects were inevitably devastating. But a suicide bomber could also be used as a diversionary tactic, sometimes as part of a secondary attack.

Then there were improvised explosive devices inside dead dogs, waiting to blow up soldiers, Iraqis, anyone. Sometimes armored convoys were attacked by roadside IEDs triggered remotely by cell phone."
B0738L5PMZ0,B0738L5PMZ,"Chris didn’t want to send Harp and Amé up to the car to forcibly pull the driver out, there was too much open ground to cover and it was too naked, too exposed. And they sure weren’t going to start pumping lead into it from here. Even if he made that threat, would the driver believe it? Could he even make it sound believable? Maybe he’d get his wish after all and they’d just sit here the rest of the day like Old West gunfighters in a duel, forever trapped at high noon; neither of them ever drawing.

Fuck me.

Sweat collected in his eyes. None of his options were good, all of them just different kinds of bad. His shirt stuck to him like a second skin—that high white sun hammering hard. It had been infernally hot for days, with no end in sight. The scrub all around was burned brown, skeletal, brittle and quick to turn to dust. Except for the yucca standing tall, crowned with its ivory flowers and marching into the distance toward the mountains, the world out here looked and felt lifeless. Like a hot breath would be all it’d take to set it aflame."
B0738L5PMZ1,B0738L5PMZ,"Harp never took his eyes off the Nissan, didn’t respond, but hitched up a thumb . . . okay.

In a perfect world, Chris would’ve put hands on the guy himself, but he didn’t have faith in his bad knee. It had never fully recovered after he’d reinjured it at the Far Six. You’ve never fully recovered. He pushed that cold thought away. But fortunately Harp had spent almost three decades on the Midland PD, many of those years as part of their SWAT team. Even though he and Amé had spent a lot of free hours together at the makeshift range near Chapel Mesa, and Harp claimed she’d developed a hell of a shooter’s eye, Chris still felt comfortable with Harp taking a tight shot more than anyone, far more than even himself. The chief deputy was the only person who had killed more men than Chris. That left Amé as the best choice, the only choice, to approach the driver if he ever showed himself.

Chris took another deep breath, steadied himself. He squinted past the shortened barrel of his A5 to the Nissan. Still there, still waiting.

Waiting for him to do something. Just like his two deputies."
B01912QBJQ0,B01912QBJQ,"She’d been in one of her best morning outfits ever: black lace Wolford tights, navy blue school uniform skirt (hemmed way up), Saina’s beat-up old cowboy boots, a new Surface to Air button-down topped with one of her dad’s old paisley Hermès bow ties from the eighties, a pair of thick tortoiseshell glasses with fake lenses—which no one had to know about—and, holding together her deliberately messy hair, a bright yellow silk sash tied in a knot. So much cooler than that poseur VainJane.com ’s outfits— Jane lived in Florida. How could anything really stylish ever happen there? How did every single outfit of Jane’s get so many comments, anyway? That girl thought that Louboutins were enough to make any outfit—so boring. Grace couldn’t understand it.

Anyway, Grace was sure that this outfit would be a hit, and she was about to post it to her blog, already anticipating the responses from her followers, when Julie had crept right up behind her, trying to be quiet. The teacher wasn’t even smart enough to realize that you couldn’t sneak up on someone who was using one of those computers because they’d be able to see the reflection of your stupid face on the screen.

As she’d reached out to tap Grace with one burgundy polished nail, Grace had turned and smiled.

And that was what she’d gotten a demerit for: Insubordination."
B01912QBJQ1,B01912QBJQ,"The pair, scallop edged and velvet upholstered, held court in front of a twenty-two-foot-high blank wall that backdropped his confession about Sabrina. Lovely, pregnant Sabrina. He’d whispered it to Saina, whispered it, and then tiptoed out the door like a thief.

Her first thought was that she’d always hated those chairs. Her second thought was that all the letters of her name were contained in Sabrina’s, as if Sabrina encompassed everything that she herself was and then, in all her goldness, offered up even more.

Saina couldn’t do anything to Sabrina and her maybe baby, so she’d gotten rid of the chairs instead. Just picked them up and placed them on the curb, where they’d at least have the chance to become part of someone else’s good-luck story. Soon, though, she couldn’t even stand looking at the empty wall where they once were; she started to wish them back, to wish him back. It hadn’t been enough to cast out the only piece of furniture they’d ever bought together, she had to strike the entire set on which they’d acted out their lives. So Saina had sold the whole damn thing and now here she was, manufacturing domestic bliss all by herself. Except. Well, except."
B0749GQT4K0,B0749GQT4K,"My fear for Darius ate through the rage that pulsed up with the power.

A solid wall of air wedged between Darius, and Dizzy and Callie, my subconscious clearly wanting the threat kept at bay even though logic said the dual mages weren’t an enemy. Back in control, I draped the spell that was torturing Darius with my colder magic, the effect manifesting as crystals of ice, frosting over the spell and wiping out the lovely sparkly affect. Another crack sounded from Darius. Fear pumped up my adrenaline.

My fire magic swirled beneath the ice, power pumping higher than I could comfortably control in normal situations. This time I didn’t balk. I used the fire to drill down into the spell as the ice slowly ate away at it from the outside. The intricate hex unraveled, fiber by fiber, getting angry as it did so.

I pulled out the fire and pushed the ice down into the frayed spell, the effect like water freezing within the cracks. The swell of magical violence stopped immediately. When I cracked the crystals of ice encrusting the spell, the whole shebang shattered like glass, falling to the floor before melting into nothingness.

I rushed forward."
B0749GQT4K1,B0749GQT4K,"So while it seemed like he was really into what we had going, and that he was genuine in the sweet nothings he said to me in the quiet hours we spent wrapped in each other’s arms, there was a very real possibility that he’d figured out how to manipulate me into getting exactly what he wanted.

A smart girl would’ve run away screaming. A sane girl would’ve kept her distance. Clearly I was neither of those, because I just couldn’t get enough. The man in him was like a disease without a cure— he ate away at me until I had no option but to submit. He was a sickness I loved to hate.

Even the vampire side of him had me on board. Dizzy was right: our practices had improved his already impressive abilities. He’d gotten faster. Stronger. More skilled. If he wasn’t better than Vlad at this point, he was as good, taking away Vlad’s upper hand physically. I doubted there was anyone in the world that could fight alongside me, complementing my abilities with his own, as well as Darius could. And if the two halves of my magic warred with each other, leaving me defenseless, I also doubted there was anyone who would protect me as viciously and ardently as he would. The girl side of me was totally into that. It was very hot."
B00JN7BNR00,B00JN7BNR0,"Its soaring black trunk was set with rough wooden pegs leading up to a substantial limb which extended farther toward the water. Standing on this limb, you could by a prodigious effort jump far enough out into the river for safety. So we had heard. At least the seventeen-year-old bunch could do it; but they had a crucial year’s advantage over us. No Upper Middler, which was the name for our class in the Devon School, had ever tried. Naturally Finny was going to be the first to try, and just as naturally he was going to inveigle others, us, into trying it with him.

We were not even Upper Middler exactly. For this was the Summer Session, just established to keep up with the pace of the war. We were in shaky transit that summer from the groveling status of Lower Middlers to the near-respectability of Upper Middlers. The class above, seniors, draft-bait, practically soldiers, rushed ahead of us toward the war. They were caught up in accelerated courses and first-aid programs and a physical hardening regimen, which included jumping from this tree. We were still calmly, numbly reading Virgil and playing tag in the river farther downstream. Until Finny thought of the tree.

We stood looking up at it, four looks of consternation, one of excitement."
B00JN7BNR01,B00JN7BNR0,"This was the tree, and it seemed to me standing there to resemble those men, the giants of your childhood, whom you encounter years later and find that they are not merely smaller in relation to your growth, but that they are absolutely smaller, shrunken by age. In this double demotion the old giants have become pigmies while you were looking the other way.

The tree was not only stripped by the cold season, it seemed weary from age, enfeebled, dry. I was thankful, very thankful that I had seen it. So the more things remain the same, the more they change after all—plus c’est la même chose, plus ça change. Nothing endures, not a tree, not love, not even a death by violence.

Changed, I headed back through the mud. I was drenched; anybody could see it was time to come in out of the rain.

• • •

The tree was tremendous, an irate, steely black steeple beside the river. I was damned if I’d climb it. The hell with it. No one but Phineas could think up such a crazy idea.

He of course saw nothing the slightest bit intimidating about it. He wouldn’t, or wouldn’t admit it if he did. Not Phineas."
B00KUQIU7O0,B00KUQIU7O,"That was why I hadn’t heard the Dragon’s footsteps. I crept anxiously down the hall, and peered through the first door. I backed out hastily: the room was full of long tables, strange bottles and bubbling potions and unnatural sparks in colors that came from no fireplace; I didn’t want to spend another moment inside there. But I managed to catch my dress in the door and tear it, even so.

Finally the next door, across the hall, opened on a room full of books: wooden shelves up and up from floor to ceiling crammed with them. It smelled of dust, and there were only a few narrow windows throwing light in. I was so glad to find the library that I didn’t notice at first that the Dragon was there: sitting in a heavy chair with a book laid out on a small table across his thighs, so large each page was the length of my forearm, and a great golden lock hanging from the open cover.

I froze staring at him, feeling betrayed by the advice in the book. I’d somehow assumed that the Dragon would conveniently keep out of the way until I’d had a chance to put down his meal."
B00KUQIU7O1,B00KUQIU7O,"I even baked an apple, with the spices: my mother had taught me to do that for our Sunday supper in winter, and there were so many ovens I could do that at the same time as everything else cooked. I even felt a little proud of myself, when everything was assembled on the tray together: it looked like a holiday, though a strange one, with just enough for one man.

I took it up the stairs carefully, but too late I realized I didn’t know where the library was. If I’d thought about it a little, I might have reasoned out that it wouldn’t be on the lowest floor, and indeed it wasn’t, but I didn’t find that out until I’d wandered around carrying the tray through an enormous circular hall, the windows draped with curtains and a heavy throne-like chair at the end. There was another door at the far end, but when I opened that I found only the entry hall and the huge doors of the tower, three times the height of my head and barred with a thick slab of wood in iron brackets.

I turned and went back through the hall to the stairs, and up another landing, and here found the marble floor covered in soft furry cloth. I’d never seen a carpet before."
B01G61PEBQ0,B01G61PEBQ,"Tongues wagging, the frightened but curious neighbors gawked as the police questioned Mrs. Minden about her discovery.

Shortly afterward, Gambelli arrived at the scene and immediately conferred with the coroner. No apparent wounds but the body showed signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, which was strange to the coroner because the tailpipe was not blocked in any way.

Further, he’d said, his crime scene technicians had inspected the undercarriage of the car and the exhaust system appeared intact. So there was a dilemma. How did Mr. Dobson die from carbon monoxide poisoning given the visible facts?

To Gambelli, stalking the car from every angle, there were only two possible solutions to this dilemma. Either Dobson died somewhere else and someone placed him in the car afterward, or someone stopped up the tailpipe of his car long enough to kill him before removing whatever plugged the exhaust system. Regardless, it looked more like murder than suicide.

After the iPad found on the front seat next to Dobson had been searched by the crime scene technicians and the appointment with Anlon discovered, Gambelli called Stevens and sent her to find Cully.

Leaning forward, Anlon played with the residue floating at the bottom of his coffee cup as he answered Stevens’ last question."
B01G61PEBQ1,B01G61PEBQ,"He might have been asleep to the average passerby, but the neighbor thought it looked out of character for Dobson.

She walked her Labrador every morning through the same Stockbridge neighborhood and not once had she seen Matthew Dobson’s car parked in the spot it now occupied in his driveway in the seven years she’d lived there. The well-maintained black Mercedes E Class was always parked underneath the cover of his carport.

But this morning it sat halfway up his driveway, the dawn dew coating the windows. As she approached the car, she noticed him sitting inside, hunched over the steering wheel. Knocking on the window, she received no response. No movement. She tried to open the car door, but it was locked. Concerned, she knocked more forcefully on the window and called out his name but still no response. Finally, she pulled out her cell phone and reluctantly called 911.

When the fire truck and ambulance arrived, they carefully jimmied open the front passenger door and the EMT felt for a pulse. Her fingers had barely touched his flesh when she knew he was dead. Cold as ice, she realized immediately even through the latex gloves she’d donned. Then the police arrived, followed shortly by the coroner.

By now, other neighbors had gathered beyond the yellow police tape."
B01FXB7CTM0,B01FXB7CTM,"We’d had to taste every relevant poison, by itself and in a variety of foods, to memorize the subtleties of its unique scent and flavor. We’d also had to forgo the antidote so we’d be able to recognize the distinctive symptoms. Some things can’t be learned by textbook.

Some things can only be learned by subjecting yourself to eight months of stomach cramps, projectile vomiting, and diarrhea.

The average person wouldn’t survive this teaching method, but all Shade trainees have the rare gene mutation PSH337PRS, which increases resistance to toxic substances.

The Taste Society didn’t tell us how they got ahold of this confidential genetic information that we’d never knowingly been tested for (well, I had some idea, but mine was a unique case). Some of us had speculated about it during training and decided it probably involved underhanded dealings with pathology labs all over the world—paying them to test all blood samples for the gene mutation in addition to whatever blood work had actually been requested. That would explain the secrecy around it.

Shades were also supposed to have above-average senses of taste and smell to assist our identification abilities. I figured we must be chosen for our above-average skills in screwing up our lives as well. Desperation was at least as important as the gene mutation in this line of work."
B01FXB7CTM1,B01FXB7CTM,"In a matter of minutes, my hair was wet enough that it was starting to kink, even with the expensive serum. At least I managed to keep my face out of the worst of it. After washing the rest of me with whatever I found in the shower, I felt a hundred times better.

Except that I didn’t have any spare underwear.

It was a tough choice between going free as an eagle, or borrowing a pair of Connor’s, but I figured I’d feel marginally less uncomfortable wearing his underwear than none at all. Especially in a skirt.

Serves him right for putting me in his bedroom , I thought as I rummaged through his underthings. He must have had half a dozen guest rooms in the house he could’ve stashed me in.

His briefs were folded and arranged by color. Definitely a neat freak. If anyone who saw Connor’s underwear drawer also saw the shopping bags still piled in the middle of my bedroom floor, they’d know immediately our pretend relationship was doomed.

Fully dressed save for my heels, which seemed like too much effort, I left the bedroom and entered the grand hallway once more. I was relieved to see someone had taken the vase away."
B016UEKRSY0,B016UEKRSY,"Martha silently mouthed the refrain once more and they all laughed. So far nobody had ever discovered them, and this was all part of the fun. Martha put her glass down and looked at the others out of the corner of her eye. Should she tell them about her dream? No, first she must get them on the same wavelength as herself, then she might be able to persuade them all to go along with her plan. They were a close-knit

group of friends and in their late fifties they had decided they would live together in their old age. So now, surely, they could make a new decision together. After all, they had so much in common. When they had become pensioners, the five of them had performed at hospitals and parish halls with their choir, The Vocal Chord, and they had all moved into the same retirement home. For a long time Martha had tried to get them to pool their funds and buy an old country mansion down in the south instead. She thought this option sounded much more exciting than a retirement home. She had read in the paper how old mansions were extremely cheap to buy and several of them even had moats."
B016UEKRSY1,B016UEKRSY,"—Christina, who loved Belgian chocolate, and Anna-Greta, the old lady who looked so old that all the other old ladies paled in comparison. They looked at each other. Martha usually had something special on the cards when she invited you in for a glass of liqueur. It hadn’t happened for quite a while, but now it was evidently time.

Once they were in her room, Martha retrieved the bottle, tidied away her half-finished knitting from the sofa and invited her friends to sit down. She threw a glance at the mahogany table with the freshly ironed floral-patterned cloth. She had wanted to replace the old table for a long while but it was big and solid and there was room for everybody around it so it would have to do for now. As she put the bottle on the table she caught sight of her old family photos on the chest of drawers. Framed behind glass, her parents and sister smiled out at her in front of her childhood home in Brantevik, a small fishing village in Österlen. If only they could see her now . . . they would not approve. They were teetotalers. Defiantly, she set out the liqueur glasses and filled them to the brim."
B00Q102M5Y0,B00Q102M5Y,"That’s the whole point of it, sort of thing. You only need to be almost asleep. And in those last few seconds when your eyes are closing, when the mists come rolling in across the boundary between what you think and what you just know , that’s when you set off. You ride into the Land-of-Almost-Awake on the backs of cloud animals, because that’s the only way of getting there. The cloud animals come in through Granny’s balcony door and pick her and Elsa up, and then they fly higher and higher and higher until Elsa sees all the magical creatures that live in the Land-of-Almost-Awake: the enphants and regretters and the Noween and wurses and snow-angels and princes and princesses and knights. The cloud animals soar over the endless dark forests, where Wolfheart and all the other monsters live, then they sweep down through the blindingly bright colors and soft winds to the city gates of the kingdom of Miamas.

It’s difficult to say for sure whether Granny is a bit odd because she’s spent too much time in Miamas, or Miamas is a bit odd because Granny’s spent too much time there. But this is the source of all of Granny’s amazing, monstrous, magical fairy tales."

MONKEY

Mum picked them up at the police station. You could tell that she was very angry, but she was controlled and full of composure and never even raised her voice, because Mum is everything Elsa ’s granny is not. Elsa fell asleep almost before she’d fastened her seat belt. By the time they were on the highway, she was already in Miamas.

Miamas is Elsa and Granny’s secret kingdom. It is one of six kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake. Granny came up with it when Elsa was small and Mum and Dad had just got divorced and Elsa was afraid of sleeping because she’d read on the Internet about children who died in their sleep. Granny is good at coming up with things. So when Dad moved out of the flat and everyone was upset and tired, Elsa sneaked out the front door every night and scampered across the landing in her bare feet into Granny’s flat, and then she and Granny crawled into the big wardrobe that never stopped growing, and then they half-closed their eyes and set off.

Because you don’t need to close your eyes to get to the Land-of-Almost-Awake."
B074KLM7M30,B074KLM7M3,"I got there just as it drew back a few feet, preparing for another attack, and leapt up and spun, my foot extending. I hit it hard, with a crunch, and heard it impact the wall as I landed, my eyes immediately seeking it out. It was lying on the floor a few feet away, the wings still … but already starting to flicker and move again.

Tian darted out, a fresh knife in her hand, but I stopped her before she got too close to the stunned creature, knowing full well how dangerous rust hawks could be. Even stunned, their talons worked reflexively, and the only way to survive a scratch from them was through amputation of the limb. But if it hit the face or chest… death was guaranteed. I passed Tian back over to Maddox and then moved over to the rust hawk, quickly bringing my foot up and down to smash the thing.

The resulting squish was gross, but satisfying, and a fresh survey of the room showed me that the other two were down as well, Grey, Eric, and Quess in the process of boot-stomping the final one.

I exhaled, relieved to see everyone relatively uninjured. But it was better to be safe than sorry, and I needed details."
B074KLM7M31,B074KLM7M3,"Grey moved in next to me to add a stomp of his own, then darted off. I followed his motion and saw him heading for Zoe and Eric. Quess was in the process of spearing a rust hawk with a metal bar, so I ignored him for now and focused on Maddox and Tian.

Maddox was in the same position in which I’d found Grey, her arm up and holding back the vicious creature. Its mouth flaps were wide open, however, and it was attempting to bite the dark-haired young woman, the ring of muscle that controlled its mouth puckering open and closed as it grabbed at her. She grunted and flinched her head back, trying to get it off of her before it managed to bite or scrape her.

Tian was behind her, the younger girl shielded by the older girl’s body. Her blue eyes were wide and filled with fear, yet as I approached, she reached around with one hand and quickly jammed something small and silver into the creature’s side.

The rust hawk gave a shrieking gasp, the lethal talons snapping at her as she withdrew her hand, leaving a tiny knife embedded in its side. Yellow fluid seeped from the wound onto the floor… but the creature was far from dead."

Certainly, when the eleven visiting canoes departed the temple and stood out to sea, each breaking off from the column for its own destination, it seemed that the days of Bora Bora’s greatness had vanished, for it was a dispirited group that occupied Wait-for-the-West-Wind. King Tamatoa acknowledged that in the game of power at the temple, he had permanently lost. All strength now lay with the High Priest, and abandonment of the island to Oro was the only sensible course. Teroro, surveying his depleted ranks, brooded on revenge, but had to recognize that the priest had outwitted him and had stricken down enough of his men to demoralize the rest. The crewmen sensed that their chiefs were disorganized and that ultimate power now lay with the High Priest, but they did not know by what political contrivances the power would be transferred; while the junior priests were so excited by the obvious victory of Oro that they had volunteered, while still on Havaiki, to assassinate both Tamatoa and Teroro and thus to settle the island’s problems once and for all.

To their surprise, the High Priest had not assented to this; in fact, he had condemned his overeager assistants and had reasoned:"
B00FO60AZK1,B00FO60AZK,"And in that instant he saw her framed against palm trees, with long black tresses glistening in the fires, and on some surging impulse he leaped to his feet, whirled into the dancing area and positioned himself before her, swinging his body in the frenzied postures of the even more erotic Bora Bora hula.

Now the beautiful young girl acted as if she had never seen her new partner before. Dancing impersonally, her eyes far away, she led the drums to faster rhythms until in mounting fire her entire body quivered and a soft glow of perspiration reflected from every angle of her golden brown skin. She bent her knees and danced close to the ground. Then, in the most characteristic passage of the Havaiki hula, she spread her knees as if entertaining a man in love, whereupon the drums retarded their beat to allow her movements to become slow and madly provocative. She closed her dark eyes and held her head far back. With one hand she caught the ends of her hair and passed them between her teeth.

Over her a savagely aroused Teroro danced until with a fiery leap he sprang high into the air, descending with his toes not inches from hers."

I pawed through the drawers, finding the usual junk. Pencils and pens. A drawer filled with instruction booklets and warranty cards for household appliances. Another drawer devoted to old issues of National Geographic. The magazines were dog-eared, and I could see Fred down here, escaping from Mabel, reading about the vanishing rain forests of Borneo.

A canceled RGC check had been carefully placed under a paperweight. Fred had probably made a copy to take with him and had left the original here.

There are parts of the country where people trust banks to keep their checks and to simply forward computer-generated statements each month. The Burg isn’t one of those places. Residents of the Burg aren’t that trusting of computers or banks. Residents of the Burg like paper. My relatives hoard canceled checks like Scrooge McDuck hoards quarters.

I didn’t see any more photos of dead bodies. And I couldn’t find any notes or sales receipts that might be connected to the pictures."
B0017I1IZK1,B0017I1IZK,"Neither was especially appealing, but I decided on my mother.

My parents live in a residential pocket of Trenton nicknamed the Burg. No one ever really leaves the Burg. You can relocate in Antarctica, but if you were born and raised in the Burg you’re a Burger for life. Houses are small and obsessively neat. Televisions are large and loud. Lots are narrow. Families are extended. There are no pooper-scooper laws in the Burg. If your dog does his business on someone else’s lawn, the next morning the doodoo will be on your front porch. Life is simple in the Burg.

I put the Buick into gear, rolled out of the apartment building lot, headed for Hamilton, and followed Hamilton to St. Francis Hospital. My parents live a couple blocks behind St. Francis on Roosevelt Street. Their house is a duplex built at a time when families needed only one bathroom and dishes were washed by hand.

My mother was at the door when I pulled to the curb. My grandmother Mazur stood elbow to elbow with my mother. They were short, slim women with facial features that suggested Mongol ancestors . . . probably in the form of crazed marauders."
B00P5557I00,B00P5557I0,"I’d spent the afternoon at Salon Antoine having my hair and makeup done, and had eaten almost nothing for two days before so my dress would drape properly. It was a beautiful pomegranate-red silk, the same material as my shoes. It matched my ruby engagement ring, and all of it set off my green eyes. Ellis had given me the dress and shoes a few days earlier, and before the party I had presented myself to him like a flamenco dancer, twirling so the skirt would take flight. He professed his delight, but I felt a familiar pang of sorrow as I tried, yet again, to imagine exactly what he was seeing. My husband was profoundly color-blind, so to him my ensemble must have been a combination of grays. I wondered which ones, and how many variations there were, and whether they had different depths. I couldn’t imagine a world without color.

Hank dropped into a chair, leaving one leg dangling over its arm. He pulled his bow tie open and undid his cuffs and collar. He looked like a half-drowned Clark Gable.

I shivered into his jacket, holding it closed from the inside.

Hank patted his chest and sides. He stopped suddenly and lifted an eyebrow."
B00P5557I01,B00P5557I0,"It was as if a rainbow had burst into a million pieces, which were now dancing across the marble, silks, and damask. We watched, transfixed. I glanced nervously at Ellis’s face, and then back at the ceiling.

An enormous cork landed next to General Pew, our host at what was easily the most anticipated party of the year, bouncing outrageously like a bloated mushroom. A split second later a single crystal the size of a quail ’s egg fell from the sky and dropped smack into his cocktail, all but emptying it. He stared, bemused and tipsy, then calmly took out his handkerchief and dabbed his jacket.

As everyone burst into laughter, I noticed a footman in old-fashioned knee breeches perched near the top of a stepladder, pallid, motionless, struggling to contain the biggest bottle of champagne I’d ever seen. On the marble table in front of him was a structure of glasses arranged so that if someone poured continuously into the top one, they would eventually all be filled. As a rush of bubbles cascaded over the sides of the bottle and into the footman’s sleeves, he stared in white-faced horror at Mrs. Pew.

Hank assessed the situation and apparently took pity on the fellow."

The flurried sidewalk dampens his paws as he sniffs around a fire hydrant. Her? Her? A street vent. Her? The trunk of a tree that in warmer months brags cherry blossoms. Her? A stretch of fog-colored siding, then a blunt interruption—the cement steps of the Red Lion Diner.

Inside at the counter , Officer Len Thomas finishes his breakfast. This final bite, the corner of toast dipped in the bit of ketchup piled with the last of the eggs, is the culmination of ten minutes of planning. Napkin dispensers on the counter: gorged, gleaming birds. He chews thirty times, gives up after sixteen, dabs his mouth with the napkin, and with a succinct gesture signals for the check.

The waitress, who had to promise him twice that she understood what dry meant, watches a television that hangs in the corner. A famous actress is coming to town. The waitress does not see Len’s gesture or hear the whistle he adds when he performs it again. She is officiating the marriage of two bottles of ketchup; overturning one and balancing it on the mouth of the other so it can empty its shit."

Pedro is an open-air pooch, not prone to evenings at home. His joints are nimble and his snout superb. He spent the previous night following the scent of a bitch, pink notes and hydrangea and dung. The pursuit led him out of the meat and coffee smells of his neighborhood to the minty trash of Fishtown. Flirting around the periphery of his brain is an idea both completely vivid and at the same time so malleable that it is not only an image but a hope. When he moves from one street to the next he feels he is moving more toward himself. He is lonely and knows he is lonely. He is in love but is not sure with whom.

As the dog awakens, the city awakens. Crust on its windshields and hungry. Snorting plumes of frustration in the harbor. Scratching its traffic on the expressway. Bone cold and grouchy, from the toes of its stadiums to the strands of its El. One by one each Main Line town revs its city-bound trains. Against the light of dawn, their track lamps are as worthless as rich girls.

Good morning, the city says. Fuck you."

According to Grandma Mazur, Evelyn had lived in the house when she’d been married to Steven Soder and had stayed there with Annie when Soder moved out. Eddie Abruzzi owns the property and rents out both units. Abruzzi owns several houses in the Burg and a couple large office buildings in downtown Trenton. I don’t know him personally, but I’ve heard he’s not the world’s nicest guy.

I parked and walked to Evelyn’s front porch. I rapped lightly on her door. No answer. I tried to peek in the front window, but the drapes were drawn tight. I walked around the side of the house and stood on tippy toes, looking in. No luck with the side windows in the front room and dining room, but my snoopiness paid off with the kitchen. No curtains drawn in the kitchen. There were two cereal bowls and two glasses on the counter next to the sink. Everything else seemed tidy. No sign of Evelyn or Annie. I returned to the front and knocked on the neighbor’s door.

The door opened, and Carol Nadich looked out at me."

I rolled in just as my mother was pulling the roast chicken out of the oven. My father was already in his seat at the head of the table. He stared straight ahead, eyes glazed, thoughts in limbo, knife and fork in hand. My sister, Valerie, who had recently moved back home after leaving her husband, was at work whipping potatoes in the kitchen. When we were kids Valerie was the perfect daughter. And I was the daughter who stepped in dog poo, sat on gum, and constantly fell off the garage roof in an attempt to fly. As a last ditch effort to preserve her marriage, Valerie had traded in her Italian-Hungarian genes and turned herself into Meg Ryan. The marriage failed, but the blonde Meg-shag persists.

Valerie’s kids were at the table with my dad. The nine-year-old, Angie, was sitting primly with her hands folded, resigned to enduring the meal, an almost perfect clone of Valerie at that age. The seven-year-old, Mary Alice, the kid from hell, had two sticks poked into her brown hair."
B01MXPF3TT0,B01MXPF3TT,"She kept flying him out, whenever she could afford a ticket, and Ralph looked a little feebler every time but never as awful as that first time, when his back was hunched and his fingers gnarled, and he was quieter, as if the fall had cleared away a part of his brain, too. He had recovered, and it was Miss Beckett who gave her reasons to worry— she called to say Ralph was moody, or Ralph was crying, or getting thinner, or Ralph was stuck inside because there was no one to shovel ice off the stoop. Her father never told her these things himself, but she had assumed he was safe, even if he had lost things. A person could live with misery.

But now Penelope could see his blood; she could picture blood crusted onto Ralph’s forehead. An idea she had managed to submerge since that first accident began to rise up in her; it settled on the rim of her conscience: her father could die while she was away.

Penelope stood, her head still clogged from the drinks, and she found her clothes. She dressed again in her fake leather skirt and brown boots, her T-shirt the faded color of wine."
B01MXPF3TT1,B01MXPF3TT,"Dr. Elias told her about the fall and calmly recounted Ralph’s injuries—broken fingers, knuckles, an eye-socket fracture, a bruised hip, likely concussion, and a few slipped discs in his spine, but he was fine. Penelope made it to the break room before her feet went out from under her, and Una and Freddie had done their best to calm her down from where they were. Freddie had even suggested putting Mirella on the phone, although he knew they hadn’t spoken in years, not since Penelope left for Pittsburgh. Penelope had shouted that no, she didn’t want to speak to Mirella, especially not now, not ever again. She had hung up, resolved to call back when her father was awake.

She had told herself that if her mother weren’t there, she would have flown to see Ralph, but then Mirella left for good, and still Penelope couldn’t bring herself to fly back. Instead she called every day and sent flowers and chocolates. When Ralph was out of his temporary wheelchair, she flew him out to Pittsburgh and saw with her own two eyes that he had survived one disaster and then another. The sight of him sealed up some of the guilt inside her."
B079NM2HL50,B079NM2HL5,"The air is frigid as I exit the arena, and my skin tightens like someone’s slid ice cubes down the ridges of my spine. Heading for my truck, I don’t notice the figure standing next to it until I’m feet away, jangling my keys against my leg and looking up from my cell phone.

I’d recognize that red hair anywhere.

What the hell is Gwen doing here?

My stride slows, and she must hear the tread of my heavy boots because she glances up from her phone with a strained expression. The loose curls of her hair are frizzier than normal. Even her clothes, which are usually perfectly tailored, look disheveled today.

Her slim, knee-length skirt is off-center, the row of buttons not aligning with her belly-button. Her flouncy shirt is half-tucked into the skirt. And, hell, the woman is wearing flats.

Gwen James is a stiletto kind of girl.

I haven’t seen her in anything else since Accounting 201.

Be casual, man.

Right. Be casual. How’s that even possible when all I want to do is muss Gwen up even more? With my fingers. My tongue. My cock.

Except for my older brother, who’s more likely to hit me up after the game in the hope for some cash. Since I’ve earned myself a solid spot on the first line during the last year, Dave has come to only one game.

He spent all three periods hitting on my teammates’ wives and girlfriends.

It was his first and only time sitting with the families. If he comes to watch me anymore, it’s not on my dime and I’m not aware of it.

After a quick shower, I pull on a pair of jeans, a worn Blades T-shirt, and my favorite leather jacket. Once everything is stowed away in my locker, I’m heading out the door. Usually I’ll catch up with some of the guys, maybe grab some lunch at this badass Italian place just around the corner from the training facility. I’m not feeling it today—between Dave hounding me for more money and the whole Gwen showdown from last night, the need to kick back with my teammates is nonexistent.

Nope.

Not today."
B078GPQXTM0,B078GPQXTM,"I had stirred up a hornet’s nest by finding the pot grow, and a week before the trial was scheduled to start, our house was firebombed. It had been the last straw in a crumbling relationship, and the next day I found myself in a judge’s chambers for an emergency custody hearing.

Maybe I should have fought harder, but Janet’s attorneys’ argument made sense to me as well as the judge. If they hadn’t gotten me this time, there would likely be a next. Both my family and I were in danger.. I suspected they were in Orlando with Janet’s sister but had no proof of that. Part of my decision to come to Miami had been the proximity to where I thought they were; the other was the lure of the water.

I’m reclusive by nature and had no problem living in a neighborhood of two houses on an island five miles from the mainland. It all sounds romantic, but in reality, even for me, it could be boring. Fishing got me through most of those times. As I looked at Justine, I wondered how this tendency of mine to seek the perimeter of civilization would affect our relationship. It was exactly this that had caused the rift between Janet and me."

Using a pair of surgical shears, Sid started to remove the wetsuit. Cutting in a straight line from her neck to her legs, he peeled away the neoprene and started to examine what was left of her skin. If you had told me what I would be looking at before I saw it, I would have been worried, but it was so clinical it didn’t really faze me. First, all the blood had long since left her body, leaving the torso china white. It just didn’t look like a person anymore.

We rolled her back over and Sid cut off the arms of the wetsuit. He removed the remaining pieces and placed them in a large clear evidence bag. With that off to the side, he continued by making the standard diagonal incisions across her chest. Devoid of blood, the cavities seemed sterile, and I was losing interest, watching Justine more than the autopsy. Unlike her, I liked live bodies. My mind started to drift to the other two live women in my life.

It had been months since I had seen or heard from my ex-wife, Janet, or our fourteen-year-old daughter, Allie."

We’ll live a life of luxury, although we’ll have to wait until old Mr. Brampton-Boyd passes away to inherit Brampton Hall, and since he prefers to spend his time in India, who knows when that may be. Venetia jokes that he only stays there to avoid his wife, bossy Mrs. B., and if I were him I’d be tempted to do the same.

About the War

This war has been going on far too long — it’s been well over six months now. Life has been insufferable. Everyone’s busy, there’s no food, no new clothes, no servants, no lights after dark, and no men around. We have to lug gas masks everywhere, and plod into air raid shelters every time the sirens go off (although they haven’t very often so far). Every evening we have to draw thick black curtains across every window to stop the light from alerting Nazi planes to our whereabouts. The crackling of the news broadcasts on the radio is interminable, with people forever shushing and banning me from playing the piano."

I live in an antiquated village full of old buildings that always smell of damp and mothballs. There is a green with a duck pond, a shop, a village hall, and a medieval church with an overgrown graveyard. The church is where we used to have choir until the Vicar decided we couldn’t go on without any men. I’ve been pestering him to change his mind, but he’s simply not listening. In the meantime I’ve been trying to set up a choir at the school. I used to go to a boarding school, but they evacuated it to Wales and Mama didn’t want me to go. So now our butler, Proggett, has to drive me five miles to school in Litchfield every day. It’s not a bad place, except no one wants to join my choir.

I have one vile sister, Venetia, who is eighteen, and I used to have a brother until he was bombed in the North Sea. We live in the big house of the village, Chilbury Manor, which is terribly grand but freezing in the winter."
B01B0NGD7O0,B01B0NGD7O,"Blood poured between the fingers that covered his mouth. He looked at me with hatred, but I disappeared into the forest before I saw if he followed me.

Just a few hours ago this trail had comforted me. Now every branch seemed to tear at my face, every rock caused me to stumble. It had been a dozen years since I ran through the castle chasing Nadea, Runir, and Nanos. Then I didn't have breasts, I was not wearing a tattered dress, and I never forgot my shoes next to a creek. I clutched my stomach where Jiure had punched me. It was tender and bruised.

I screamed as I stepped on a thorn and felt it cut through my right foot. I took a few steps on it and cried through the pain. The barb forced me to stop, lean against a tree, and dig through the blood on the bottom of my soft feet. After what seemed like an eternity, I found the thorn and pulled it out without screaming again. Then I continued to run through the forest toward the farm house. Each step spread my blood upon the dirt and drove pain up into my leg."
B01B0NGD7O1,B01B0NGD7O,"I looked around the glade, there was no way anyone would hear me from this distant, sheltered spot, even if I could call out without him striking me again. I did not carry a weapon and I cursed myself for being so naïve as to think I did not need one. I looked nearby for something within arm’s reach I could use to stun him long enough so I could run away. I could run. I was smaller than Jiure and nowhere near as strong, but I could be faster. I had to be. My head hurt, but I was conscious and otherwise uninjured. If I could get him off of me long enough to rise, I would run. I felt around me with my free hand for a loose rock or a stick, anything to use as a weapon against this beast. My fingers grasped nothing but the soft wet moss.

Jiure fumbled with his belt ties with his right hand while he held me down with his left. His face was frantic with excitement, lust, and rage. My stomach knotted in terror, driving the air in and out of my body in a painful screech. He let go of my shoulder and kneeled upright a little more so both of his hands could access his belt."

He closed the door behind him and locked it again.

Hayley knew she wasn’t to disturb him when he was making work-related calls, but nevertheless, he didn’t want to take any chances. There was no way he would be able to explain to her the rationale for what happened in the other parts of his compartmentalized life, and when their relationship came to an end, as it undoubtedly would sooner rather than later, he didn’t want any loose ends left behind.

Boris brought his desk computer out of sleep mode, entered a password, and clicked onto Skype, which he knew would automatically encrypt the call he was about to make.

He scrolled down his list of contacts until he came to a certain name, then pressed the call button.

After a couple of rings, the video screen opened, and gradually, the flickering picture stabilized. Boris could see a man with short dark hair wearing a pair of sunglasses. The sound came on and Boris could hear background noise."

But she might be able to put some context around everything Petar had said and help him out. Given her longer experience in the region, she would probably have a better idea than him about how to navigate her way through the labyrinth of government bodies and sources of information in these parts. It was certainly worth a try.

Johnson got off the bus when it stopped outside the Valamar Lacroma hotel. Instead of going to his room, he turned left down a road, past two other large tourist hotels, the Neptun and Royal Palm, and onto a pathway running along the rocky coastline. After a few hundred yards he came to the Cave Bar. Tucked underneath the cliff, the bar was built into a cave that extended deep into the cliff face and had an outdoor seating area right next to the water.

He sat down well away from the few other customers and ordered a beer, still feeling spooked by the shooting.

Johnson waited until the beer arrived, then checked carefully around him for possible eavesdroppers, pulled out his phone and placed an encrypted call to Jayne, as was his habit with her.

She answered almost immediately."

However, she was surprised the day before to find that the middle of the day was most satisfactory as well.

So, this particular morning saw a bit of a delay before the master and mistress of Pemberley arose, dressed, broke their fast, and prepared to leave on the first leg of their trip to Liverpool. All their bags and trunks had been packed the day before, and Darcy had met with his steward for the last time before their departure. Two carriages were being utilized, mainly for the luggage. However, the Darcys had given his valet and her lady’s maid leave for the month to visit their families. The new husband and wife were finding that they liked helping the other dress and vice versa, and the hotels would have valets and maids for their convenience once they reached Ireland.

Darcy also hired outriders—as he always did—for the journey to Liverpool. Part of their travel would take them through the Peak District with several places that would be conducive to highwaymen. He would not take any chances that would allow Elizabeth to come to harm. He would always err on the side of safety."
B07B13SY961,B07B13SY96,"Neither Darcy nor Elizabeth noticed her entrance or her rapid exit from the room.

* * *

Later, when Darcy left to attend to business, Elizabeth spent the rest of the afternoon determining which dresses and accessories she would have packed for the trip. To her surprise, Mrs. Lamont had done such an outstanding job with just her measurements, there was little that needed to be altered. Those few dresses would go to the modiste, Mrs. Barkley, in Lambton with whom her husband had made arrangements beforehand.

However, they found they needed an extra day to finish preparations before leaving for Liverpool. Darcy was glad that he had alerted his ship’s captain, Robert Lowery, that they might be a day or so later if they were delayed. Captain Lowery was paid handsomely for being at Darcy’s beck and call and would reserve several days for their arrival. Darcy had warned him a month in advance that he was getting married and to expect to make a trip to Ireland before winter set in. And Darcy was delighted that his wife looked forward to their Irish adventures as much as he did.

Chapter II

Early on the day of their departure from Pemberley, Elizabeth awoke to her husband ardently kissing her."
B01N0M5GKR0,B01N0M5GKR,"It feels like a trap. Isn’t this something a predator would do? As soon as I’m close to the door, he’ll push me inside. He’ll force me to do things, and after the soundtrack to last night, I know no one would help me if I scream.

But when you’re down to two pairs of jeans, losing one is a big deal. I take a step closer, eyeing him the way I’d watch a snake on a hiking trail. There’s a hard edge in his eyes, like he’s seen death. Like he expects to see it again. I’m leaning away from him as I approach my door, ready to fight if he comes at me.

Instead he watches me, arms folded over his massive chest. It’s not an attack, but he’s not leaving me in peace either. His gaze feels intent, more serious than the wandering interest of a random homeless person.

I manage to shut the door. The heavy lock clicks into place.

This time when I look at him, it’s with wry gratitude. I still don’t trust the man, but there’s an intimacy to his intrusion to my morning peace, a coded message in the way he stands and watches."
B01N0M5GKR1,B01N0M5GKR,"I gave it to him, but it wasn’t enough.

Now I’m determined to get back my family’s home.

Sunlight enters the motel room through a vertical slat between heavy curtains, splitting the room into two halves. An unmade bed on one side, a nightstand with a dusty Bible. The table and chair on the other side, with the haphazard pile of clothes and books, artifacts from a former life. A rectangle of light hits the mirror, and I use the reflection to brush my teeth and comb my hair into something half-respectable. Where I’m going there are tailored suits and high-end manicures. I’ve got a Smith University T-shirt and my favorite pair of jeans, thin armor in the fight of my life.

I shove all my cash into my back pocket, wrapped around my room key, unwilling to leave it behind for even a few hours. I doubt there’s daily housekeeping at the Rose and Crown, and if there were, they might not steal, but I can’t take any chances. My worldview has narrowed from tuition payments and charity auctions to the price of a hot dog at the corner store.

Opening the door, bright light blinds me.

I stumble over a large warm body blocking my path."

It didn’t seem a day for death, somehow, but death had come nevertheless.

She sighed and turned away. Returning to the lane outside, she saw that Gemma had started her enquiries with the houses farthest north, which meant that she’d probably told Frank to take those to the south. As far as Hillary could see, the entire hamlet consisted of just this one street, and the cottages that lined it. There was no sign of a pub, or a church, or, of course, that rarity of rarities nowadays, a village shop.

With a sigh she decided to take the house next door on the left. This house was built of red brick, which had mellowed to pink over the ages, and had neatly trimmed but uninspired lawns at the front and side. There was no answer to her knocking. She then tried the neighbour on the other side, and as she was walking up the flagged path, the front door of the house opened even before she reached it. An old lady with a mop of curly white hair stood there anxiously, looking at her out of wide watery-blue eyes."
B079Z1WXTY1,B079Z1WXTY,"Right.’ She let Barrington lead the way, and a moment later, stepped into a small parlour.

Like most country cottages, the windows weren’t huge, and the light was inclined to be a little dim, but the woman who rose from a chair had been sitting by the window itself, and Hillary could see at once what Barrington had meant.

She looked ill. Very ill indeed.

She must have been about five feet ten, just about Hillary’s own height, but she seemed much taller. It took Hillary a few seconds to realise why that was, then saw that it was because she was so thin: she gave the impression of being a beanpole. The ridges and nobbles of her collarbone were visible above her white cardigan, and the sleeves hung baggily over what were obviously stick-thin arms. She was wearing a dark blue skirt that came to just above her bony knees, revealing shins so sharp they looked as if they could slice bread.

She couldn’t have carried a spare ounce of fat anywhere on her frame. She had dark hair, cropped uncompromisingly short, and large blue eyes which stared out of a gaunt face that reminded Hillary uncomfortably of those photographs of holocaust victims. Dark exhausted bags sat under her eyes."
B07466FFJF0,B07466FFJF,"But they would soon learn that the storm had devastated the whole of the Northeast, not just Albany. The official count of the dead would total four hundred, with thousands more injured, and a hundred unaccounted for. In Albany, twenty-three people died, and five had gone missing, among them Emma and Claire.

By the next morning, their driver, Harold, had managed to dig out their sleigh from the carriage house, and he drove them to the police station on Dove Street, located several blocks from the former Sutter home.

The precinct house seemed to be in the process of disintegrating. The dull red bricks emanated a shabby weariness that cast a deep pall on the otherwise well-kept neighborhood. Until now, Mary had never once had cause to visit the station, and the narrow vestibule, where little daylight penetrated, did nothing to dispel an impression of suffocating gloom. A lanky policeman hunched at the front desk, a kerosene lantern flaring on a hook above his head, its sooty ghost smoked into the wall. No gas jets burned in this hulking building, for it was too old for such modern conveniences. Inside it was so cold that you could see your breath."
B07466FFJF1,B07466FFJF,"The two families separated only when Bonnie married David. Then, a few years later, both families moved back to Albany.

The weight of this deep and enduring bond pressed on Mary and William the next morning as they ventured out again, following the path that they had forged the previous day. The city was already coming back to life. Many people were daring the cold, shoveling great mounds of snow, but mostly accomplishing only a rearrangement of the white stuff. Frustrated, people set bonfires in an attempt to melt it quickly, but that succeeded only in creating lakes of ice too treacherous to negotiate. A few businesses had opened. Enterprising chestnut roasters had fired up their braziers and were doling out small rations in paper cones for a penny. A dry goods store shuttered the day before was doing brisk business in sacks of flour and cakes of butter. A baker had shoveled his sidewalk early in the morning and was proferring hot rolls. Mary and William bought both rolls and chestnuts and consumed them standing on a corner before pressing on to Elm Street, where they knocked on the doors of David and Bonnie’s neighbors and had the same conversation again and again."
B01AZMYFOE0,B01AZMYFOE,"My lofty bed was about a six-hour jog to the north of the capital of Nia and a two-week run from the village of Merrium, where the princess hid. I had decided to leave the horses with Jessmei and our adopted family for a variety of reasons. I moved faster through the forests on foot, and therefore, avoided the main roads. I also felt that I owed Greta and Rayat for our time at their home. Jessmei agreed and figured that the gift of the steeds, plus my help around the ranch, was fair compensation for our stay.

I opened my pack, grabbed a handful of jerked beef, and slowly chewed on it. The tough, sinewy meat helped wake up my mouth so I could focus on my task. I had traveled at an easy-paced jog for the last two weeks, sleeping for six hours every night before journeying onward toward Nia. I caught a rabbit or two almost every day, so my travel rations hadn't suffered. Even as I ate in silence, I heard several rodents scurry about the forest floor. I was the perfect hunter, and it would be almost trivial to catch and cook any of the game that roamed these forests."
B01AZMYFOE1,B01AZMYFOE,"Our friendship and love got us through the hardship, and then we had focused on what had really mattered: killing our enemies.

But that ache lay in my distant memories. Perhaps I remembered him because of the loss Jessmei just experienced. Thoughts of her made my heart sink in pain. I wanted to be with her now, to comfort and help her get through this. But we had finally agreed that I should journey back to Nia alone. She was understandably clingy and scared, but I had assured her that I would return to her. Though she was scared, she was not selfish enough to insist I remain with her after the initial shock wore off. Princesses were accustomed to sacrificing their needs for those of their country and family. She had lived her whole life resigned to the fact that she would be married to someone she did not love, or even know, just to pad Nia’s coffers. Losing me when she needed familiarity and comfort came naturally to her and she bore our parting with grace. Her initial passionate and uninhibited displays of agony had subsided and she regressed to the composed, if less cheerful, girl she had been.

I untied myself from the large oak tree in which I slept and checked my surroundings."
B076HKN1J20,B076HKN1J2,"After checking soldiers weren’t around, she would lift me up to trace the petals of the flower and its curving stalk. For years she’d lifted me, until one day I could stand on my tiptoes and touch it myself. Now, whenever I passed this place, I continued the tradition, stroking the welded flower with fondness.

Leaving the Money Coil and my welded flower, I wiped perspiration from my hairline and began retracing my steps to reach the shelter of The Crane’s Nest on the other side of the Inbetween. Mistress Moons, the sun’s rays burned with muggy heat this morning.

At this time of day, the laneways were about the busiest they ever got, and I smiled and nodded at nearly everyone. I’d known them my whole life —seemed rude not to say howdy. Hyrriet from House Hy glared at me, and I pretended not to see her pristine ankle-length skirt and perfectly ironed aketon which she’d drawn in at the middle with a wide leather belt. Hers had been the last potato bush I’d killed. I swear I’d done everything right, but two days later, Mum told me they’d found it shriveled up.

I dodged through the crowd and knocked at the back door of Dyter’s, tapping my foot as I waited."
B076HKN1J21,B076HKN1J2,"And second, we weren’t leaving Zone Seven until morning, which meant I’d be seeing a rebel leader tonight. He probably had a scar on his cheek—and muscles.

I lifted a hand to my eyes as I scanned the sky for the Drae. Nowhere to be seen.

Facing toward the king’s castle in the distance, I darted through the hodgepodge peasant housing of the Penny Wheel on my way to the House of Tal. I went through the Inbetween, and soon the grand stone houses of the Money Coil were ahead of me. I slowed when I reached the Tals’ house —the largest of them all. I left the second basket at their door after pounding on the heavy entrance for a full minute.

The barren garden from last night stretched before me, the grand fountain at its center.

This time, with no winged foe above me, I stopped at the fountain that had been dry my entire life. Pausing here was habitual because a tiny welded flower was inlaid in the side of the concrete fountain—the sole bit of beauty in the otherwise functional and practical space. I don’t know how it caught my eye as a toddler, but Mum said I’d pester her from dawn up to dusk about visiting the flower."
B000FCK65W0,B000FCK65W,"She had had the McCarthy book only twice. The librarian recommended these two books over and over again. Maybe they were the only ones she herself had read; maybe they were on a recommended list; maybe she had discovered that they were sure fire as far as eleven-year-old girls were concerned.

Francie held the books close and hurried home, resisting the temptation to sit on the first stoop she came to, to start reading.

Home at last and now it was the time she had been looking forward to all week: fire-escape-sitting time. She put a small rug on the fire-escape and got the pillow from her bed and propped it against the bars. Luckily there was ice in the icebox. She chipped off a small piece and put it in a glass of water. The pink-and-white peppermint wafers bought that morning were arranged in a little bowl, cracked, but of a pretty blue color. She arranged glass, bowl and book on the window sill and climbed out on the fire-escape. Once out there, she was living in a tree. No one upstairs, downstairs or across the way could see her. But she could look out through the leaves and see everything."
B000FCK65W1,B000FCK65W,"Some of the reading had been wonderful; the Louisa Alcott books for example. She planned to read all the books over again when she had finished with the Z’s.

Saturdays were different. She treated herself by reading a book not in the alphabetical sequence. On that day she asked the librarian to recommend a book.

After Francie had come in and closed the door quietly behind her—the way you were supposed to do in the library —she looked quickly at the little golden-brown pottery jug which stood at the end of the librarian’s desk. It was a season indicator. In the fall it held a few sprigs of bittersweet and at Christmas time it held holly. She knew spring was coming, even if there was snow on the ground, when she saw pussy willow in the bowl. And today, on this summer Saturday of 1912, what was the bowl holding? She moved her eyes slowly up the jug past the thin green stems and little round leaves and saw…nasturtiums! Red, yellow, gold and ivory-white. A head pain caught her between the eyes at the taking in of such a wonderful sight. It was something to be remembered all her life."
B0042JSNXG0,B0042JSNXG,"They passed through the tollbooth checkpoints and parked just outside the Technical Area, a group of buildings surrounded by yet another high wire-mesh fence with two strands of barbed wire running along the top. Connolly glanced up at the watchtowers, where bored MPs gazed out toward the mountains. It was an indifferent concentration camp, too cheerful to inspire any alarm. Girls in short dresses and sweaters, presumably secretaries, passed through the fence, barely flashing badges at the young guards. The two largest buildings were long barracks of offices, connected by a second-story covered passageway over the main road, which gave the town its own form of grand portal. It was late afternoon, and buses were filling with day laborers for the trip back home, down the mesa. Connolly noticed a busload of Indian women, with their stern faces and braided hair, pulling away toward the gate. In the most secret place in the world, there was maid service.

Connolly and his bags were deposited at the security office with Lieutenant Mills, tall, pencil-thin, and prematurely balding in his twenties, who smiled nervously and kept glancing away, as if he wanted to examine his new colleague from an angle before meeting him head on."
B0042JSNXG1,B0042JSNXG,"The landscape changed as they climbed, sagebrush and stunted junipers giving way to taller piñons and alpine trees. The air smelled fresh, as if it had been rubbed with astringent, and the bright blue sky went on forever. Connolly felt the alertness of higher altitude, awakened from Santa Fe’s timeless nap. There was traffic on the road now, trucks grinding up the steep grade or jerking and halting their way back down, and everything moved quickly. The entire hill was on the march. As they approached the east gate, the activity increased. Cars waited to be passed through security, and beyond the fence Connolly could see a giant water tower and the instant city, a jerry-built ant farm of dull green army-issue buildings, Quonset huts, and barrack apartments. They were still building it. The air itself seemed obscured by dust and tangles of overhead wires, noisy with construction and running motors. Men, mostly civilians, darted through the unpaved dirt streets with the quick steps of people who had somewhere to go. Connolly’s first thought was that a whole college had somehow been dropped accidentally into an army camp. While Santa Fe dreamed on below, up here in the high, cool air, everything was busy."
B016PX6EZ00,B016PX6EZ0,"His brain plunged so suddenly into whether his mother would still be there when they got home that he forgot to look at the meter to answer his own question about costs.

His father dropped heavily onto the seat next to him, slammed the door, and gave the cabdriver their address.

Then they were moving. And then the experience of that night was over, except to the extent that it never would be.

Ethan was afraid his father would talk to him on the way home. Try to explain. Want to pull it out onto the table for examination. Or maybe he would light into Ethan for being stupid enough to run out into the city night.

He made up his mind that whatever he was asked, or told, or no matter how he was chastised, he would remain silent. He owed his father nothing. And he had no intention of paying the man more than he was owed.

Ethan had worried for no reason. They rode home in silence. Utter, crushing silence.

Still, Ethan trembled.

Five Days Before That Worst Night

Chapter Two : Catch

Three months and five days before his father disappeared

Ethan dragged Glen down the hall to his room by the sleeve of his friend’s hoodie."
B016PX6EZ01,B016PX6EZ0,"Ethan tries not to look back on that night. At least, as much as human nature allows. But it’s a funny thing about your darkest moments. They have a life of their own. They come around because they’ve got you pinned. Because they can. The harder you try to push them back into the shadows, the stronger they grow. They draw power from your resistance.

If it had been cold in that police station the trembling wouldn’t have been so humiliating. But an ancient furnace bellowed heat right onto Ethan’s side. He hunched over himself on that hard wooden bench and felt sweat break out on his forehead, run down his back. It was overheated in that place.

But still Ethan trembled.

He looked up to see a uniformed officer looming over his bench. He jumped, startled, enough that he knew the officer could see, would know. The cop was obviously no threat to him, which made his reaction humiliating. But when you’re already swimming in a sea of humiliation deep enough to drown you, it doesn’t matter much if somebody throws in another bucketful. It’s not worth it to stop and pay attention to that when you need to keep paddling."
B079L2JNWK0,B079L2JNWK,"What fun it would be to truly possess the identity of another for just a night, to get a taste of what a man must feel. She knew she could never make her way into a gentlemen’s club or a gambling hell. But there were private parties which women attended. Not typically young, unmarried ladies, however, but women. She realized what might happen if anyone found out, but perhaps it was worth the risk…

She jumped when the door to the library opened. It was the butler, Jenkins, advising that her presence was required in the drawing room immediately.

Her mother wanted to see her. Well, that should make this day more interesting. She walked through the expansive halls lined with portraits of her ancestors, the former earls and their families, many of whom had walked these very same corridors. What were their hopes and dreams? Their reasons to be? Was it simply to wander this house themselves, have more children and continue to populate the family line? It was very likely, at least for the women of the family.

She put aside her musings as she entered the drawing room, where her mother sat waiting for her amongst the overstuffed, impossibly uncomfortable furniture."
B079L2JNWK1,B079L2JNWK,"She had little money of her own to spend, no more than a small allowance for frivolities. It hardly seemed fair when she had a more than generous dowry awaiting the husband who never seemed to be coming.

If only she were a man. Then she could come and go as she pleased, to the clubs and the bars and the gambling hells where she knew she would not just spend money, but win it. She had a way with numbers, and anyone who had ever played cards with her soon refused to again as she was near to unbeatable but for games of chance. She remembered the numbers and suits of the cards — they flowed through her head as they were dropped onto the card table. In games such as whist, she knew what had been thrown and what was to come. She knew what sequences were available, and what others were likely holding onto by the hands they played.

Why was it that a gentleman could throw away every last pound, while if she were ever caught stepping foot into such a place she would be ruined? It was so very unfair.

The more she thought of the possibilities of gambling, the more it stirred something inside of her."
B003WUYR8Q0,B003WUYR8Q,"How crazy can she possibly be? Suppose she had let me win—what would have been lost? Why a knife, why the threat of murder, why is such total and annihilating victory necessary—when only the day before she set down her iron on the ironing board and applauded as I stormed around the kitchen rehearsing my role as Christopher Columbus in the third-grade production of Land Ho! I am the star actor of my class, they cannot put a play on without me. Oh, once they tried, when I had my bronchitis, but my teacher later confided in my mother that it had been decidedly second-rate. Oh how, how can she spend such glorious afternoons in that kitchen, polishing silver, chopping liver, threading new elastic in the waistband of my little jockey shorts—and feeding me all the while my cues from the mimeographed script, playing Queen Isabella to my Columbus, Betsy Ross to my Washington, Mrs. Pasteur to my Louis—how can she rise with me on the crest of my genius during those dusky beautiful hours after school, and then at night, because I will not eat some string beans and a baked potato, point a bread knife at my heart?"
B003WUYR8Q1,B003WUYR8Q,"Do I want to be pushed around and made fun of, do I want to be skin and bones that people can knock over with a sneeze, or do I want to command respect?

Which do I want to be when I grow up, weak or strong, a success or a failure, a man or a mouse?

I just don’t want to eat, I answer.

So my mother sits down in a chair beside me with a long bread knife in her hand. It is made of stainless steel, and has little sawlike teeth. Which do I want to be, weak or strong, a man or a mouse?

Doctor, why, why oh why oh why oh why does a mother pull a knife on her own son? I am six, seven years old, how do I know she really wouldn’t use it? What am I supposed to do, try bluffing her out, at seven? I have no complicated sense of strategy, for Christ’s sake — I probably don’t even weigh sixty pounds yet! Someone waves a knife in my direction, I believe there is an intention lurking somewhere to draw my blood! Only why? What can she possibly be thinking in her brain?"
B009NESIEE0,B009NESIEE,"At her most famous dinner party she hired a sprinkling of actors to pose as staff and one as an unfortunate guest who was then dramatically poisoned during the first course. It was then up to the remaining guests to solve the mystery before the police arrived or they themselves were eliminated through one heinous end or another.

It was just this kind of daring enterprise that had catapulted her and, by default, her husband, businessman and tobacconist Phillip Maxwell, to the top of the London social scene.

Grace had never been invited to one of Vanessa’s parties before; to say they didn’t travel in the same circles was putting it kindly. Grace’s husband Roger knew Phillip Maxwell professionally and had known Vanessa before either of them were married. But Grace, coming from Oxford, was still an outsider.

Mallory, however, had been twice before; a distinction she both relished and pretended not to notice. She’d been the first to fall into the water at the famous midnight pool party and charmed everyone with the nonchalance with which she proceeded to wear her sopping wet gown, transparent and clinging to her admirable figure, for the rest of the evening.

Tonight, however, was a relatively simple affair by comparison. As loyal members of the Tory Party, the Maxwells were hosting a campaign fund-raiser aimed at securing Anthony Eden as prime minister."
B009NESIEE1,B009NESIEE,"It was a time of mysterious, yet dramatic metamorphosis. One minute there was nothing but storms and rain; a moment later a field of daffodils appeared, exploding triumphantly into a fanfare of colour.

Grace pressed her fingertips against the cold glass of the window. This was not, as her husband Roger put it, their real house. He had more ambitious plans for something grander, closer to Belgravia. But Grace liked it here; being in the centre of Bloomsbury, close to London University and King’s College, it reminded her of Oxford, where she’d lived with her uncle until only a few years ago. It was filled with activity; businesses and offices, and students rushing to class. In the street below, a current of office workers, wrapped in raincoats, heads bent against the wind, moved in a steady stream towards the Underground station after work.

Grace leaned her head against the window frame.

It must be nice to have a job. A neatly arranged desk. A well-organized filing cabinet. And most of all, purpose.

Now that she was married, her days had a weary open-endedness about them; she floated like a balloon from one social obligation to another.

Roger took each engagement very seriously."
B00BRVU6ZK0,B00BRVU6ZK,"A part in an independent movie came his way, playing himself, really.

But he found that once the camera rolled being himself wasn’t at all easy.

His usually flippant delivery became leaden and—most embarrassingly—he froze, was literally incapable of remembering a single line of the script, take after mortifying take.

So his career was stillborn.

He got a couple of photographic shoots— no lines to forget—posing on the decks of yachts with pretty girls, or stepping out of luxury cars in tuxedos, but somehow the camera just did not love him, as his agent told him when he snipped all ties.

So Forrest Forbes started to gamble.

He’d always been a dabbler— it was in his blood — but now he played with desperation.

Desperation and very little skill.

He lost.

He lost badly.

Lost so badly that he ended up having the pâté kicked out of him in that downtown alley.

And now he is on a train rattling north toward one of those horrible coastal feeder-towns, all new money and Spanish kitsch, he is sure.

He sighs and polishes off his drink as his stop is called.

When Forrest steps out onto the platform he sees Eric Royce waiting for him, waving a languid hand."
B00BRVU6ZK1,B00BRVU6ZK,"He was born into a very old Boston family, silver spoon firmly in place when he exited the birth canal.

The eldest of three children he was sent to Andover and Harvard just like his father and grandfather before him.

His father, Forrest Bennett Forbes II, seemed interested only in blowing the wealth accumulated by his father, FBF I, an austere Yankee industrialist who had served two terms in the Senate.

By the time he was ten Forrest had skied at Gstaad, holidayed in Monaco with the Grimalidis and had ridden on an elephant with an Indian princeling.

When he reached his early twenties—even though he’d scraped together a useless degree from Harvard —he’d been encouraged to play just as his father played.

His was a world of women, horses, racing cars and yachts.

Then in Forrest’s thirtieth year (on a day in late 2008) his father called him to his office.

Forrest—tanned as teak from a month in Morocco— assumed that the older man was going to tell him that it was time for him to curb his life of leisure, to at least feign some interest in the family business.

The elder Forrest Forbes, standing by the window, held up a decanter of fine brandy."
B0022Q8CSC0,B0022Q8CSC,"She let her right hand drop from his neck and reached down to guide him. Her hand closed around an enormous, blood-gorged pole of muscle. It pulsated in her hand like an animal and almost weeping with grateful ecstasy she pointed it into her own wet, turgid flesh. The thrust of its entering, the unbelievable pleasure made her gasp, brought her legs up almost around his neck, and then like a quiver, her body received the savage arrows of his lightning-like thrusts; innumerable, torturing; arching her pelvis higher and higher until for the first time in her life she reached a shattering climax, felt his hardness break and then the crawly flood of semen over her thighs. Slowly her legs relaxed from around his body, slid down until they reached the floor. They leaned against each other, out of breath.

It might have been going on for some time but now they could hear the soft knocking on the door. Sonny quickly buttoned his trousers, meanwhile blocking the door so that it could not be opened. Lucy frantically smoothed down her pink gown, her eyes flickering, but the thing that had given her so much pleasure was hidden inside sober black cloth."
B0022Q8CSC1,B0022Q8CSC,"Not for one moment did he show surprise at the wedding gift being presented to him personally. He understood.

The money in the envelope was sure to be more than anyone else had given. Brasi had spent many hours deciding on the sum, comparing it to what the other guests might offer. He wanted to be the most generous to show that he had the most respect, and that was why he had given his envelope to the Don personally, a gaucherie the Don overlooked in his own flowery sentence of thanks. Hagen saw Luca Brasi’s face lose its mask of fury, swell with pride and pleasure. Brasi kissed the Don’s hand before he went out the door that Hagen held open. Hagen prudently gave Brasi a friendly smile which the squat man acknowledged with a polite stretching of rubbery, veal-colored lips.

When the door closed Don Corleone gave a small sigh of relief. Brasi was the only man in the world who could make him nervous. The man was like a natural force, not truly subject to control. He had to be handled as gingerly as dynamite. The Don shrugged. Even dynamite could be exploded harmlessly if the need arose. He looked questioningly at Hagen."
B015VACH4U0,B015VACH4U,"The proceedings would last a month and end with Abeeku’s chief ceremony. The women of the village prepared food from sunrise to sunset; drums were made out of the finest wood, and the best singers were called upon to raise their voices. The funeral attendants began dancing on the fourth day of the rainy season, and they did not rest their feet until the ground had completely dried.

At the end of the first dry night Abeeku was crowned Omanhin, chief of the Fante village. He was dressed in rich fabrics, his two wives on either side of him. Effia and Baaba stood next to each other as they watched, and Cobbe paced the crowd. Every so often, Effia could hear him muttering that she, his daughter, the most beautiful woman in the village, should be up there too.

As the new chief, Abeeku wanted to do something big, something that would bring attention to their village and make them a force to be reckoned with. After only three days in office, he gathered all of the men of the village to his compound. He fed them for two days straight, got them drunk on palm wine until their boisterous laughing and impassioned shouting could be heard from every hut."
B015VACH4U1,B015VACH4U,"The soldier had died from fever, leaving his wife and two children much wealth to do with as they pleased. Effia prayed for the day all of the villagers would call her Effia the Beauty, as Abeeku called her on the rare occasions when he was permitted to speak to her.

Millicent’s mother had been given a new name by her white husband. She was a plump, fleshy woman with teeth that twinkled against the dark night of her skin. She had decided to move out of the Castle and into the village once her husband died. Because the white men could not leave money in their wills to their Fante wives and children, they left it to other soldiers and friends, and those friends paid the wives. Millicent’s mother had been given enough money for a new start and a piece of land. She and Millicent would often come visit Effia and Baaba, for, as she said, they would soon be a part of the same family.

Millicent was the lightest-skinned woman Effia had ever seen. Her black hair reached down to the middle of her back and her eyes were tinged with green. She rarely smiled, and she spoke with a husky voice and a strange Fante accent."
B07C8FJ8HM0,B07C8FJ8HM,"By the time he climbs on the bed with me, I’m so wet and impatient that I grab his hand and shove two of his fingers inside me. I tighten my grip on his fingers and he works harder, moving faster. He can tell I am close.

I tremble beneath him, my muscles clenching as an orgasm rocks through me. Once he withdraws his fingers, he fists his cock. Positioned between my legs, he eases into me slowly, giving me time to adjust to his size. My body relaxes along with his, and then he picks up the pace and grips my hips. He fucks me—just like I had asked.

Sloan lifts one of my legs over his shoulder and pushes further inside me. I tighten my grip on him, a brush of heat spreading from my cheeks to my toes, as an intense orgasm builds. He shows no sign of completion, pumping faster with each thrust, beads of sweat trickling down his forehead. We lock eyes, another earth-shattering orgasm dominating my body. He thrusts into me a few more times before he leans down to kiss me, slow and passionate. After Sloan leaves a trail of kisses along my chest, he slides out of me, still hard and ready for more."
B07C8FJ8HM1,B07C8FJ8HM,"I look up at him, as if I need a reason to have sex with this yummy hunk of man. He closes and locks the door behind us, my anxiety now kicking up another notch.

Sloan comes up from behind me and sets his hands on my hips, pulling my back into his chest. He’s hard and digging his erection into my ass cheek. Dipping his head down to kiss my neck, he moves his hands up to my breasts, cupping them over my dress. I am so done. My nipples harden from his simple touch. There’s no way I can walk away now.

He unzips me, his fingers on my skin, sending a chill down my spine as he helps me out of my clothes. The dress drops to the floor at my feet, leaving me exposed, bared to a man I don’t even know. Everything about this night is uncharacteristic for me. Even my dating profile wasn’t me.

My bra and panties are next, falling to the carpet along with my dress. Sloan spins me around so that our eyes meet, and appraises every inch of my naked body. He flicks his tongue across his bottom lip, his subtle gesture dampening my panties."
B000TO0TDK0,B000TO0TDK,"Smith took time to examine these symbols and try to translate them. The first group he could not grok at all. It might be one of those formal sounds these people used . . . yet it had been spoken with force, as if it might be a last communication before withdrawal. Perhaps he had so deeply mistaken right conduct in dealing with a woman creature that it might be ready to discorporate.

He did not want the woman to die at that moment, even though it was its right and possibly its obligation. The abrupt change from rapport of water ritual to a situation in which a newly won water brother might be considering withdrawal or discorporation would have thrown him into panic had he not been consciously suppressing such disturbance. But he decided that if it died now he must die at once also—he could not grok it any other wise, not after giving of water.

The second half contained symbols he had encountered before. He grokked imperfectly the intention but there seemed to be a way to avoid this crisis—by acceding to the suggested wish. Perhaps if the woman took its clothes off neither of them need discorporate. He smiled happily."
B000TO0TDK1,B000TO0TDK,"Or at his arrival in this crushed space? He was suddenly assaulted by lights and sounds of that arrival, feeling it with mind-shaking pain. No, he was not ready to embrace that configuration —back! back! back beyond his first sight of these others who were now his own. Back even before the healing which had followed first grokking that he was not as his nestling brothers . . . back to the nest itself.

None of his thinkings were in Earth symbols. Simple English he had freshly learned to speak, less easily than a Hindu used it to trade with a Turk. Smith used English as one might use a code book, with tedious and imperfect translation. Now his thoughts, abstractions from half a million years of wildly alien culture, traveled so far from human experience as to be untranslatable.

In the adjoining room Dr. Thaddeus was playing cribbage with Tom Meechum, Smith’s special nurse. Thaddeus had one eye on his dials and meters. When a flickering light changed from ninety-two pulsations per minute to less than twenty, he hurried into Smith’s room with Meechum at his heels.

The patient floated in the flexible skin of the hydraulic bed. He appeared to be dead."
B076CQLTF30,B076CQLTF3,"I felt like a rich kid, not a skint one from the East End.

Tony would have loved this. He was a bit of a bugger but I suddenly missed him. I missed his bony knees and holey jumper and the fact that he didn’t seem to give a damn what anyone thought of him. And the way he loved Mum with a fierceness that was sometimes hard to understand and which had got worse since Daddy went away to war. I stared out the window at the little houses and the people walking along the street, the women queuing outside the butcher’s. There weren’t any bombsites or damaged houses – maybe there wasn’t a war on in this place. It was hard to believe that only this morning me and Olive had been saying goodbye to Mum in Rannly Court and now we were in a big posh car heading to our new home. It felt funny sitting behind this man and woman who we didn’t really know, but it didn’t feel uncomfortable or scary. The lady kept turning round to smile at us and ask if we were all right, and to point out things that she thought we might be interested in."
B076CQLTF31,B076CQLTF3,"Whoever picked these two was going to have to give them a jolly good scrub down, because it looked as if their faces had never been within a mile of water. By the way they were scratching at their heads, they were going to need de-lousing an’ all.

After we’d eaten, Olive fell asleep beside me. I stared out the window at the unfamiliar countryside. Little rivers ran between green fields, and cows and sheep dotted the hillside. It was a different world, a softer world. A world that I had known nothing about until now. My whole life had been spent around the tenements and streets of Bermondsey. I’d only ever seen cows and sheep in the butcher’s window and they were dead. I felt a stirring of excitement in the pit of my stomach and just for a moment I found myself almost looking forward to what was coming next.

We had to change trains twice and both times groups of children were led away to their new homes. Eventually we reached our destination, and the train slowed and stopped as we pulled into the station. I rubbed at the steamed-up window with my cardigan sleeve to try and see where we were, but all the signs had been painted over.

Our carriage door opened and a woman stuck her head inside."
B00FO60B040,B00FO60B04,"Deftly the flying reptile snapped its beak and caught its prey, which uttered high shrieks as it was carried aloft. For some moments the little animal hiding in the ginkgo watched the flight of its enemy as the reptile dipped and swerved through the sky like a falling feather, finally vanishing with its catch.

The little watcher could breathe again. It was unlike the great reptiles, for they were cold-blooded and it was warm. They raised their babies from hatching eggs, while its came from the mother’s womb. It was a pantothere, one of the earliest mammals and progenitor of later types like the opossum, and it had scant protection in the swamp. Watching cautiously lest the flying hunter return, it ventured forth to renew its inspection of the lagoon, and after a pause, spotted what it had been looking for.

About ninety feet out into the water a small knob had appeared on the surface. It was only slightly larger than the watching animal itself, about six inches in diameter. It seemed to be floating on the surface, unattached to anything, but actually it was the unusual nose of an animal that had its nostrils on top of its head. The beast was resting on the bottom of the lagoon and breathing in this inventive manner."
B00FO60B041,B00FO60B04,"There was a ripping sound as the crocodile tore off a strip of flesh, and a sharp guttural click as the wounded dinosaur responded to the pain. Then peace returned. The dinosaur could be heard for some moments retreating. The disappointed crocodile swallowed the meager meal it had caught, then returned to its loglike camouflage, and the furry little animal returned to its earlier preoccupation of staring at the surface of the lagoon.

Its attention was poorly directed, for as it watched, it became aware, with a sense of terrible panic, of wings in the darkening sky, and at the very last moment of safety it threw itself behind the trunk of a ginkgo tree, flattened itself out, and held its breath as a large flying reptile swooped down, its gaping, sharp-toothed mouth open, and just missed its target.

Still flat against the moist earth, the little animal watched in terror as the huge reptile banked low over the lagoon and returned in what under other circumstances might have been a beautiful flight. This time it came straight at the crouching animal, but then, abruptly, had to swerve away because of the ginkgo roots. Dipping one wing, it turned gracefully in the air, then swooped down on another small creature hiding near the crocodile, unprotected by any tree."
B00CX5BYCI0,B00CX5BYCI,"In my case, the second element I had control over is fire, meaning I was a lot older than my early thirties appearance suggested. This second form can never be the opposite to one already learned, so I could never learn earth or water magic, no matter how much I tried.

The second school of magic is called Omega magic. This magic is too powerful to be wielded by a novice. For this reason, any sorcerer wishing to use Omega magic is usually millennia old at least. It consists of mind, matter, shadow, and light. As with the Elemental school, each magic corresponds to a different color, although I wasn’t powerful enough to use any of the four types.

Over the years, I’d heard rumors of a third school. Blood magic. But I’d never found anyone willing or knowledgeable enough to talk about it at length. The only thing I did learn— it scares the shit out of people.

Without Francis, I’d probably still be living on the streets, using just enough magic to keep myself alive. But even after the discovery of what I was, I’m wary of using too much magic; the idea of having the feeling of being able to do anything with magic was not one I wished to repeat."
B00CX5BYCI1,B00CX5BYCI,"The windows on the warehouse exploded out, embedding the glass deep in the nearest tree trunk a few dozen feet away from where I sat. Originally, I thought I’d gone mad, but over the next few days I used magic over and over again. Just a little here and there, but eventually I started to hear voices. They told me to keep using magic, to let it flow out of me. That shook me enough to stop using it altogether as I started my search for who, and what, I was.

Francis had been the man to not only tell me about the world I live in— and I couldn’t possibly thank him enough—but also make me aware of exactly what I was, a sorcerer.

He explained that a sorcerer’s magic is bound to two different schools. The first is Elemental—water, earth, fire, and air. Most users of magic start in this school; the magic I’d used in my target’s bedroom was air, hence the white glyphs, which crossed over my arms. Each type of magic corresponds to a different color glyph—white for air, orange for fire, green for earth, and blue for water.

Sorcerers start by learning one form of magic in the Elemental school. But over time, anywhere from decades to centuries, they can learn a second."
B07556VD4Y0,B07556VD4Y,"He’d been kind to her, and if there was indeed over a week left of this journey, she may need to lean on that kindness again. Instead, she thought about what she knew. She knew that the Valia kindred were the oldest society in Ellest, and had perhaps been here even longer than the royal family. They were a warrior clan, who trained their young in combat and survival from the age of five. She had heard that the weak, unconventional and disobedient were exiled to the outskirts of their territory, to work the essential but lesser jobs. That was just gossip, though. People feared the Valians, and fear created all kinds of stories.

When Bleak had still been spending a lot of time at the tavern in Angove, she’d heard drunken tales about how some believed the Valian leaders to be demigods, descendants of Rheyah the Huntress. Or at least they had been in the past. Their magic was passed down through generations, although still outside the laws of the four continents. Some people blamed them for the mist that encroached on the realm, inch by inch, year by year. If Bleak had learned anything through her condition it was that people loved to blame, and that like all negativity, blame festered and rotted the good away.

She turned to Fiore."
B07556VD4Y1,B07556VD4Y,"As she went to cup the water, she realised her hands were shaking. Although her situation was hardly ideal, she wasn’t at that moment afraid. She held out her hands, palms down before her and watched them tremble in wonder. Hearing Fiore clear his throat behind her, she plunged them into the water. She stifled a cry of pain as the icy water stung her open wounds, but she held them in there.

Once her wrists were numb, she splashed her face and tried to rub at least some of the dirt away. She could hear Lennox’s thoughts nearby; she didn’t so much as roll her sleeves up to wash elsewhere. She stank, but perhaps in this case, that wasn’t a bad thing.

She sat, legs outstretched on the outskirts of the company, next to Fiore, who handed her a waterskin and a piece of stale bread. Bleak wolfed it down, the hard dough drying out her mouth. She received no more. Gods, she was starving. She sipped the water slowly, letting it soothe her fat, swollen tongue. She had to avoid relieving herself again until nightfall.

She wanted to ask Fiore more about the Valia kindred, but didn’t want to get him into any trouble."
B07BR7428H0,B07BR7428H,"He was reading something. And the more I watched him, the more I wanted to get to know him. Which was crazy because wasn’t he the reason I was here? Or would I have ended up right where I was regardless of the fact that his picture had been in my column?

I had to believe the latter.

Didn’t I?

I had to get out of here. I really was going crazy. Blaming some stranger for my woes. That wasn’t me. Then again, I didn’t look like me or feel like me.

Did I?

Just as I took my first step toward the door, my phone buzzed in my hand. I’d forgotten to place it in my purse after I spotted the mints. I didn’t want to know what the message said, but I read it anyway.

SIMON: Great eye. He’s a good catch. By the size of those camera bags, I’d say what’s inside is easily worth thirty grand each.

Dumbstruck, my head darted around the bar. I didn’t see Simon anywhere, but somehow he saw me.

How’d he know those were camera bags, anyway? Did he have a friend who also worked the x-ray machine, for Christ sake?"
B07BR7428H1,B07BR7428H,"My crush looked the same as he had in the picture, but different at the same time. Older. Cleaner cut. More professional.

His dark hair was slightly shorter, cropped close on the sides but longer on top. The hint of scruff was exactly the same, though. And just as appealing.

Dressed in tuxedo pants and a wrinkled white shirt, he had a duffle and two other bags in tow.

Stranded.

He was definitely stranded.

But was he coming or going?

My guess— he was going, so this wasn’t a layover. Besides, he’d been on Hunks of Atlanta, so he must be from here.

I lowered my gaze.

Although he was wearing tuxedo pants, I wouldn’t call them designer, and there definitely were no fancy shoes since he was wearing a pair of black and white Adidas.

No high-end luggage, either. Just a bunch of beat-up leather bags.

Sure, then I was able to survey a man. I almost laughed at myself. At how pathetic I was. Still, I liked that he didn’t fit the criteria for one of my marks. It made him off-limits, which was good.

Suddenly, I felt so alone. And he looked so very alone, too. Mad. Brooding. Upset. I watched him."
B00GU2RLMC0,B00GU2RLMC,"Nic had hired her so she must have seen something in the surly Miss Klock. Maybe next summer A.J. will work up the energy to fire Molly.

A.J. kicks the remaining customers out (he is most annoyed by an organic chemistry study group who have bought nothing but have been camped out in magazines since four— he’s pretty sure one of them clogged up the toilet, too), then deals with the receipts, a task as depressing as it sounds. Finally, he goes upstairs to the attic apartment where he lives. He pops a carton of frozen vindaloo into the microwave. Nine minutes, per the box’s instructions. As he’s standing there, he thinks of the girl from Knightley. She had looked like a time traveler from 1990s Seattle with her anchor-printed galoshes and her floral grandma dress and her fuzzy beige sweater and her shoulder-length hair that looked like it had been cut in the kitchen by her boyfriend. Girlfriend? Boyfriend, he decides. He thinks of Courtney Love when she was married to Kurt Cobain. The tough rose mouth says No one can hurt me, but the soft blue eyes say Yes you can and you probably will. And he had made that big dandelion of a girl cry. Well done, A.J."
B00GU2RLMC1,B00GU2RLMC,"She is just his most recent disappointment. She has had disappointments, too.

She is thirty-one years old and she thinks she should have met someone by now.

And yet . . .

Amelia the bright-sider believes it is better to be alone than to be with someone who doesn’t share your sensibilities and interests. (It is, right?)

Her mother likes to say that novels have ruined Amelia for real men. This observation insults Amelia because it implies that she only reads books with classically romantic heroes. She does not mind the occasional novel with a romantic hero but her reading tastes are far more varied than that. Furthermore, she adores Humbert Humbert as a character while accepting the fact that she wouldn’t really want him for a life partner, a boyfriend, or even a casual acquaintance. She feels the same way about Holden Caulfield, and Misters Rochester and Darcy.

The sign over the porch of the purple Victorian cottage is faded, and Amelia nearly walks past it.

Inside, a teenager minds the till while reading the new Alice Munro collection."
B07BMHM7CV0,B07BMHM7CV,"Crap, Dick is behind the desk, which means Devin left on time, which means it was brought to Dick’s attention that I wasn’t here on time, again. Devin hates me. I’d probably hate me too after an overnight shift, but I’ve never been rude to him. On the contrary, I try to kiss his ass. It doesn’t work, though.

I drop off my coat in the back room on one of the four hooks along the wall that’s covered in employee reminders and laws, including a memo about cleaning our hands after we use the bathroom. That flyer continues to concern me. Every day since it has been posted, I wonder who complained. Who realized this was an issue, and how many people forget to wash their hands after using the bathroom? My thoughts return to the present moment as I remember Dick is out front waiting for me.

I should not look him in the eye, but it’s hard to avoid when he’s staring at me with arms folded over his chest. I’ll just punch into the computer and pretend like he’s not there. All will be well, and he can go on his merry little way, checking up on housekeeping."
B07BMHM7CV1,B07BMHM7CV,"So here I am, the only person who would likely turn down a full ride at college in exchange for freedom. If I let Dad pay, it would only be an extension plan for his ownership of me, and there was no way I could feed into that any longer. I want to start my story at the beginning—my beginning, which means rejecting what looks easy and never turning back. In other words, having a smothering boyfriend at the beginning of my story is not going to work out too well. For him. I’ll deal with that shortly, though.

I use my paper map to search for the location of my dorm, finding it on the other side of the grassy quad. At least the dorms aren’t co-ed, which is pretty much the only thing working in my favor for this fresh-start thing I’m attempting. I realize I’ve done this to myself. Despite the fact that I’m not the— I want to be near you, next to you, taste you, breathe you in, and sniff your butt —demented part of the relationship I’m in , I haven’t taken the necessary move to break free from it. I was set to take off in my own direction to college … alone, but Teak insisted on going to the same university."
B00FH7987M0,B00FH7987M,"The torn end of the backstay flew past the spot where Lucia’s head had been seconds before and crashed against the porthole, sending huge teak splinters and broken glass flying, and breaking the cabin door. The cable rose in the air, shaking like an angry cobra, and crossed to the other side of the mast, where it tore off part of the storm sail we’d hoisted up. Then I realized Pritchenko wouldn’t need to cut the forestay. The hurricane had solved that problem for us.

As the boat perched sideways on the crest of a wave, an enormous gust hit us and we witnessed a sight few sailors have seen and lived to tell about. The mast of the Corinth II, weakened after hours in the storm, finally surrendered. With a crunch that set my teeth on edge, the crack gaped wide like a dark mouth and burst, splattering the deck with carbon-fiber pieces. The mast rose into the air, sucked up by the hurricane. The bow mast hung in the air for a few seconds, tied to it by the other shroud, like a strange X made by a crazed carpenter. With a jolt, the other shroud ripped, amid the swirling rain, and the mast fell into two gigantic waves that passed us on the right. We were safe by a hair. But the situation was still grim."
B00FH7987M1,B00FH7987M,"We were at the top of a huge wave when alarming sounds came from the mast. Pieces of carbon fiber peeled off lengthwise, leaving a hole in the mast as wide as my finger. The rigging howled and threatened to collapse. The sailboat heeled sharply as it rode the crest of the wave. With a roar, it rushed down the slope in a waterfall of foam.

For a couple of seconds, the wind stopped. The Corinth II was protected in the thirty-foot-high gap between two huge waves. All was surreally calm. I could plainly hear the raindrops falling onto the deck. That lull was what Lucia had been waiting for. She calmly slung the HK over her shoulder, aimed at the mount holding the backstay to the hull, and pulled the trigger.

The HK sprang to life in Lucia’s hands, though she could hardly control its powerful recoil. A string of holes appeared in the rear deck and pieces of teak, fiberglass, and hot metal rained down on us. Two of the bullets hit the spot where the stay was attached to the hull. When the bullets tore into the steel cable, drawn taut by the enormous power of the wind in the sail, it snapped like a twig and unraveled before our eyes."
B00CCPIITQ0,B00CCPIITQ,"The pot was growing heavy in her hands, and she could hear the rain hissing down outside, and the gutters dripping, and Mrs. Hill still talking, low, urgent, insistent, the words themselves teasingly unclear. It was a cardinal sin to eavesdrop; Mrs. Hill herself had impressed this upon both Sarah and Polly in their training, but this was just too much. Sarah set the pot down on the bare boards, slipped out of the servants’ corridor and crept, breath held, along the main hall.

A hand on the cool wood of the library door, she listened. She still could not hear what was being said; she could only hear that something was; so it wasn’t really eavesdropping, was it? And still Mrs. Hill talked, and talked, and the longer she talked the stranger it became that she was still talking. Mr. B. would lend you a book, but he didn’t want to hear what you thought about it. He’d say thank you for any service you performed, but he wouldn’t even catch your eye. How could she have so much to say to him, and why—and this was the truly baffling thing —was he just letting her go on saying it?"
B00CCPIITQ1,B00CCPIITQ,": this change was certainly to be welcomed. Mr. Hill had become, quite suddenly, old. Last winter had been a worrying time: the long drives, the late nights while the ladies danced or played at cards; he had got deeply cold, and had shivered for hours by the fire on his return, his breath rattling in his chest. The coming winter’s balls and parties might have done for him entirely. A nice young man to drive the carriage, and to take up the slack about the house; it could only be to the good.

Mrs. Bennet had heard tell, she was now telling her husband and daughters delightedly, of how in the best households they had nothing but menservants waiting on the family and guests, on account of everyone knowing that they cost more in the way of wages, and that there was a high tax to pay on them, because all the fit strong fellows were wanted for the fields and for the war. When it was known that the Bennets now had a smart young man about the place, waiting at table, opening the doors, it would be a thing of great note and marvel in the neighbourhood."
B00FAFJU8S0,B00FAFJU8S,"Feeling a bit peckish, I opened the fridge. It was empty, and it hadn't been when I’d left the house. I closed it and scratched my head, thinking it was strange. The wards I'd cast were still up and working when I'd come in. The dog’s food bowl was still full, along with the water.

I shook my head and went to the living room, grabbing up the remote and flipping on the TV while sinking blissfully into the couch. Mister Fancy Pants sat at my feet, wagging his tail happily. He looked bigger now and more alive now than he had when I'd brought him home.

He turned his head and leveled me with clear blue eyes. I patted his head and his eyes closed, like he really liked head pats and scratches and wanted more. I felt something ripple inside the room, and instantly went on guard. My heart raced as the thought of the Fae who had killed my parents flashed inside my mind. I reached into the cushion, pulling out one of the handguns. This wasn’t happening.

I felt someone sift in behind me. I turned and took aim, but Ristan was faster. He disarmed me and swore."
B00FAFJU8S1,B00FAFJU8S,"The band began playing Buckcherry's Sorry, and it took everything inside of me to hold the tears back. I stood before I knew what I was doing, and walked towards the stage. He looked good, even if he was undead. His dark hair was pulled back and hidden in a ponytail. His skin was a little lighter, and he lacked a pulse, but he was still Adrian. He was still the first boy I'd ever loved.

I sang silently along with the lyrics, his lips moving with a cocky grin as he sang. I stopped at the edge of the stage and watched as he moved to stand directly in front of me. I hadn't expected him to stop in front of me, but he did. The microphone was still in his hand, held up to his mouth so it didn’t disturb the song he was still singing. His free hand reached out and grabbed mine. I closed my eyes so he wouldn't see the flinch that came with his icy touch. I tried to pull away, but he held me in place as the song slowed and then stopped.

He leaned his face close to mine as if he would kiss me, but instead he kissed my cheek and pulled me against him."
B074WP8GZ10,B074WP8GZ1,"I wasn’t sure exactly what I’d say when they started questioning me, but I knew I needed to deny, deny, deny.

Whatever the hell the truth was, I wasn’t ready to admit it to my brothers, let alone to myself. I was the responsible one, the oldest, the one who didn’t fly by the seat of his pants. Somehow in all of my making the right decisions and choices, I’d ended up in a relationship that no longer brought me happiness. And to be honest, I hadn’t been happy in years.

Yet Shelby still stayed and never complained. God, that woman was a saint. What kind of man falls out of love with a saint?

Glancing at the clock, I noted the time and headed out of the office and into the nearly empty bar. Almost everyone had left, including Jess and her friend.

Claudia and Britney, however, were right where I’d left them.

I wasn’t sure if I was relieved that Claudia hadn’t left without saying good-bye, or nervous that she was still here. I stared at her profile, memorizing the way her hair moved as she did, wondering what it would feel like in my hands. Was it as soft as it looked? What did it smell like?"
B074WP8GZ11,B074WP8GZ1,"Hiding from Claudia, hiding from whatever these feelings were, hiding from my brothers.

Hiding from the truth.

Since we’d opened the bar, I’d never spent time hanging with any of the customers. Unlike Nick, who lost all control of his balls whenever Jess walked through the doors, I didn’t want to mix my personal and professional life. I’d convinced myself that they shouldn’t cross over, and told Shelby that as well.

Thank God she listened and stayed away most of the time. She was a middle-school teacher and was always busy planning lessons or grading papers, and went to sleep at a decent hour like regular people. On the rare occasion that she had stopped in the bar, I tended to hole up in the office, wishing she’d leave.

Fuck, that made me sound like a real asshole. And you know what? Maybe I was. I didn’t know anymore.

I wasn’t sure of anything after tonight, and I hadn’t even technically done anything wrong. But I had acted out of character, and Ryan and Nick both knew it.

I could tell they couldn’t wait to give me shit about it by the way they were both casting glances at me. Ryan especially."
B005723JSQ0,B005723JSQ,"So I thank him again and head to a nearby sofa, full of adrenaline. I have a phone and I have a plan.

It only takes me five minutes to write out my new mobile number on twenty separate pieces of hotel writing paper, with POPPY WYATT — EMERALD RING, PLEASE CALL!!!! in big capitals. To my annoyance, the doors to the ballroom are now locked (although I’m sure I can hear the cleaners inside), so I’m forced to roam around the hotel corridors, the tearoom, the ladies’ rooms, and even the spa, handing my number out to every hotel worker I come across and explaining the story.

I call the police and dictate my new number to them. I text Ruby—whose mobile number I know by heart—saying:

Hi! Phone stolen. This is my new mobile number. Cn u pass to everyone? Any sign of ring???

Then I flop onto the sofa in exhaustion. I feel like I’ve been living in this bloody hotel all day. I should phone Magnus too and give him this number — but I can’t face it yet. I have this irrational conviction that he’ll be able to tell from my tone of voice that my ring is missing."

And he hurt my shoulder. Bastard. Maybe I could sue him for millions. If they ever catch him, which they won’t.

Ficus … newspapers … bin …

Bin.

Wait.

What’s that?

I stop dead in my tracks and stare into the bin, wondering if someone’s playing a trick on me or I’m hallucinating.

It’s a phone.

Right there in the litter bin. A mobile phone.

1 His specialism is Cultural Symbolism. I speed-read his book, The Philosophy of Symbolism, after our second date and then tried to pretend I’d read it ages ago, coincidentally, for pleasure. (Which, to be fair, he didn’t believe for a minute.) Anyway, the point is, I read it. And what impressed me most was: There were so many footnotes. I’ve totally got into them. Aren’t they handy? You just bung them in whenever you want and instantly look clever.

Magnus says footnotes are for things which aren’t your main concern but nevertheless hold some interest for you. So. This is my footnote about footnotes.

B01MUKXO8S0,B01MUKXO8S,"They needed the kind of incontrovertible proof that only someone intimately familiar with the subtle skeletal distinctions between not only races, but the various ethnicities and geographic variances within those races could provide. If they could prove that Boko Haram was targeting a specific ethnicity or religion, then a formal tribunal could be assembled, without which there could be no direct intervention, at least not without the majority of nations on board, and that wasn’t about to happen as long as military action would be perceived as a war against Islam in this climate of political correctness.

The problem was that until the civilized world acknowledged that it was at war with extremism, the forces aligning against it would continue to rally the disenfranchised to their cause.

Sometimes it seemed to Jade as though she inhabited two different worlds. Back home she taught osteology and genetic mutation within the safe environs of the University of Colorado Medical School. It was often staggering to think that while we were all the same on the inside, it was the almost trivial variations in genetic expression that divided humanity, and man’s very nature that pitted him against those he identified as different when there was otherwise such beauty in the world."
B01MUKXO8S1,B01MUKXO8S,"Despite the formal declaration of a state of emergency and the creation of several new infantry divisions, the number of extremists continued to grow, fueled by the prospect of marauding the countryside in hordes straight out of the Middle Ages. A trail of scorched earth followed them from one village to the next as they expanded their territory. To date, they’d murdered more than 25,000 people and displaced millions in the process of securing 50,000 square miles of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad. They needed to be stopped and forced to stand for their crimes against humanity before their numbers swelled to the point that they no longer could be.

Jade skidded down the dirt mound and into the pit, where the remains of bloated men, women, and children lay, discarded and seething with black flies. She removed her camera and digital voice recorder from her bag and began the laborious process of documenting the nature of the wounds and the various causes of death. Those near the bottom had been butchered in the most horrific ways, while those nearer the top had been shot point-blank in the back of the head. Whether the executioners had already sated their taste for killing or had simply needed to expedite the process was a matter of speculation.

While her skills as a forensic anthropologist were overkill at this juncture, they were crucial in establishing a case for genocide."

She was about to warn her hosts, when Toby came in on the cello. It would be rude to interrupt the child; she’d wait until the end. She’d expected him to be rubbish, assuming that Louisa was a deluded, selectively deaf mother who couldn’t hear the screeching tune being murdered on the half-size instrument. But Toby could play. He wasn’t Jacqueline du Pré but he was better than the kids who performed solos at the school where Helen used to teach. And they had been teenagers; this was a boy of eight. When he finished she clapped as enthusiastically as the other guests.

Louisa announced that they would play the last part again so that Toby’s brothers could join in. She hit the piano keys harder this time. Leo, the middle child on the violin, hadn’t inherited his brother’s talent. Napoleon retreated to the dining room to escape the highpitched whining. Louisa nodded at Murdo but he continued chewing his tambourine. He joined in the applause at the end."

But it could be the blood-cherry cheesecake. Or the matted, pink-black belly fur of the dead dog. Or the gaping crew-neck sweater oozing its obscene innards onto the parquet floor. Or Gary.

She sits on the edge of the bed, her arms cradling her knees. If she could focus on the cello, the rest might fade. She must grab the sticky instrument; drag it into view; admire the thickening stains on the polished wood; remember the small, expert hand that once pressed against the fingerboard; and strain to hear the soothing sound of his playing. But it won’t be enough to block out the other images. Seventeen days so far and nothing has dimmed.

She stands up and paces the floor, her joints grating from lack of exercise. They let her walk in the yard at the back of the police station, but the snow piled at the fence reminded her of the cell so she asked to go back in. White room. White loo in the corner, no seat or lid. The only stab of colour is the green button by the door. She presses it."
B077699J4D0,B077699J4D,"Gramps wove pieces of Paris in his successful import export business of fine French wine and cheese.

When my mom left for college, Gramps and Nana sold the house, cars, and the import / export business, then moved to Paris. I can tell they love it here; it’s home sweet home to them. Nana said she was heartbroken when they learned the Love Lock Bridge fence would be taken down two years ago. So Gramps went out, bought chain-link fence material, and made a replica of the famous fence with only one lock on it—theirs. He gave it to her for their anniversary and apparently she cried a pool of elated tears for a good fifteen minutes.

Yeah, I too would totally be that guy.

If I had a wife to love as much as Gramps loves Nana.

The town car GPS commands an authoritative Turn left, and then one mile ahead, your destination will be on the right, pulling me back to now.

Dutifully following directions, I turn left, trailing along, and spot the large gray and white building, Chateau De Grenelle, ahead. The place alone is an intimidating five grandiose stories of unmistakable wealth. The type of residence that sits on New York’s Park Avenue."
B077699J4D1,B077699J4D,"You see, Gramps has decided to take a break from the business. He and Nana want to head to the villa they bought in the South of France. Nana has her heart set on opening up an art gallery near the villa and Gramps doesn’t want her there alone. The original plan was to sell the business, but Gramps said he’d much rather it stay in the family. So, Gramps took me under his wing, teaching me the little intricacies about his limo service. I’ve shadowed Gramps, allowing myself to absorb all I can about the business, been out with other drivers learning routes and the beautiful streets of Paris, getting to know a few clients, and most of all…grasping the concept of being subservient, since part of my duties will be driving a client around. Subservience is a totally new concept for me. In my previous life, I was used to being served. I was the one being driven around. The one who had places to go and people to see.

Kind of, anyway.

I must say, I’ve done an excellent job fleeing my old life and honestly I don’t even know who I am anymore.

An amused expression quirks up the side of Nana’s mouth as she studies me."
B00LZWV8JO0,B00LZWV8JO,"So, all the Russians except for Bo were old hands at this, and once they had exchanged brief greetings with Dinah they glided through the middle of the Hub, looking about curiously since some of them hadn’t seen it before, and then through the hatch into the Zvezda module, which was like home to them. They exchanged clipped remarks in Russian of which Dinah understood about 50 percent. Everyone who worked on Izzy had to have at least working knowledge of Russian.

Rhys Aitken was an engineer who had made a career of building strange new constructs, usually for wealthy clients. Until seventeen days ago, his mission had been to lay groundwork for the addition of a second, larger torus, built around a newer Hub aft of the existing one and intended for space tourists. This was part of a public-private partnership between NASA and Rhys’s employer, a British billionaire who had been one of the early movers in the space tourism industry. Rhys had a new mission now, but he was still a perfect fit for the job.

Dinah went back through the orbital module and peered through the hatch at him, lying there patiently motionless in his couch."
B00LZWV8JO1,B00LZWV8JO,"In the three couches, where humans were supposed to ride, were the two other scheduled cosmonauts, Yuri and Vyacheslav, and the Brit, who was named Rhys.

Bolor-Erdene, Yuri, and Vyacheslav took their first chance to unstrap and move up through the orbital module into the Hub. Rhys requested that he be given a moment.

Dinah went into the Hub to greet the other four. In normal times

these moments were at least a little bit ceremonious, with the new arrivals being greeted with hugs, or at least high fives, as they glided through the hatch, and photographs taken. The impending deaths of everyone on Earth cast a bit of a pall over this occasion, but Dinah felt she should at least say a few words to each of them.

Bolor-Erdene urged Dinah to address her as Bo. She was obviously of Far Eastern stock, and yet there was something in her eyes and cheekbones that did not look precisely Chinese. Dinah’s preliminary googling had already told her that Bo was Mongolian.

Yuri and Maxim were coming to ISS for their third and fourth times, respectively. Vyacheslav seemed to be a last-minute substitution for a younger cosmonaut who would have been making his first trip to the ISS. Vyacheslav had done two previous stints."
B000FBFMZM0,B000FBFMZM,"The keen-eyed Menion led, picking out the best path, relying heavily on his sense of direction in the semidarkness. Shea followed close behind him, and Flick brought up the rear, glancing occasionally over his shoulder into the still forests. They stopped only three times to rest and once more for a brief lunch, each time quickly resuming their march. They spoke infrequently, but the talk was lighthearted and cheerful. The day wore quickly away, and soon the first signs of nightfall were visible. Still the forest stretched on before them with no indication of a break in the great trees. Worse than this, a heavy graying mistiness was once again seeping into view in gradually thickening amounts. But this was a new kind of mist. It lacked the inconsistency of the lowland mist; this was an almost smokelike substance that one could actually feel clinging to the body and clothes, gripping in its own peculiarly distasteful fashion. It felt strangely like the clutching of hundreds of small, clammy, chilled hands seeking to pull the body down, and the three travelers felt an unmistakable revulsion at its insistent touch. Menion indicated that the heavy, foglike substance was from the Mist Marsh, and they were very close to the end of the forest."
B000FBFMZM1,B000FBFMZM,"They ate a quick breakfast, and then Flick prepared to climb one of the towering oaks. He pulled on the heavy, flexible boots and gloves, which Shea then coated with a thick pasty substance from a small container. Menion looked on quizzically, but his curiosity changed to astonishment as the stocky Valeman grasped the base of the great tree and, with a dexterity that belied both his bulky size and the difficulty of the task, proceeded to climb rapidly toward the summit. His strong limbs carried him upward through the tangle of heavy branches and the climbing became slower and more difficult. He was briefly lost from sight upon reaching the topmost branches, then reappeared, hastening down the smooth trunk to rejoin his friends.

Quickly the climbing gear was packed and the group proceeded in a northeasterly direction. Based on Flick’s report of the sun’s present position, their chosen route should bring them out at a point along the east edge of the Mist Marsh. Menion believed that the forest trek could be completed in one day. It was now early morning, and they were determined to be through the Black Oaks before darkness fell. So they marched steadily, at times rapidly, in single file."

I’m not close enough to get a good photo, I know, but anything’s better than nothing. I zoom in slightly – too much and it will be blurry, the camera on this phone isn’t great. Just as I tap the screen to take the photo, he looks up. He looks up and over at me. I hear myself gasp and before I even think about it I’m out of the park and walking up towards the shops. I put my phone back in my pocket with shaking hands. He wasn’t supposed to look at me. He wasn’t supposed to see me. That wasn’t meant to happen. Shit.

But then I realise I need to go back. I need to talk to him. I’ve waited so long and there he is, I can’t just run away, can I? What if I never see him again? I think about what Freya said this morning about walking over and mounting him. Of course I’m not going to do that, but maybe I could go over and just talk to him. Yes. That’s what I should do. Oh god."
B075V8272L1,B075V8272L,"He’s sitting on the right bench, halfway down the side where I just walked. He must have been behind me because he definitely wasn’t there when I passed. Everything about him is exactly as I expected it to be: black boots, jeans, a black T-shirt and a black pea coat, rectangular black glasses. His dark hair is swept back from his forehead and his face is turned up to the sun. I lean against the tree and stare at him. I know he doesn’t look over because I’ve seen this before. I know I can just watch him, that he’ll sit there, head back, eyes closed, legs crossed at the ankle.

I’ve waited for this moment for so long that I thought it would feel much weirder than it does. It actually seems completely natural. I don’t even feel particularly nervous. In fact, I’m almost giddy with happiness, so much that I almost want to laugh out loud. How many times have I walked up to this park to look for him? How many times have I talked about this to my friends? It’s become a running joke now. They won’t believe I’ve really seen him.

I stand up straight. Actually, they really won’t believe it. They’ll think I’ve completely lost the plot."

Chapter 5

Howie dashed along platform five of Liverpool Street station, hopped on the 10.45am Eastern Express service to Romford, and located his reserved seat in the first-class carriage. But there was a problem – the seat wasn’t empty. A muscular, shaven-headed young man wearing a colourful tracksuit and skull stereo – a bizarre cross between a motorcycle crash helmet and a 1970s glitter ball – was slouched across it. As the young man tapped his fingers and feet, oblivious to anything non-musical, Howie double-checked his reservation. Yes, 42B – this was definitely his reserved seat. And that was definitely a younger, fitter, much physically stronger man sitting where he should be.

As he stood in the gangway, pondering what to do, Howie could hear and feel the vibrations of the music pulsating through the skull stereo. It was so loud, he could make out the lyrics from five metres away. And he recognised the song instantly – it was Fly Pelican, Fly by a bunch of tone-deaf anarchists called Super-Mega Electro Thrash, whose lead singer and keyboard player he’d once had the misfortune of spending an evening with."
B072MJXKNL1,B072MJXKNL,"And no one ahead of her seemed to want to make any kind of physical contact with the inconsiderate bunch of filthy, yellow-hatted forty-somethings who were just standing there, munching away, ignoring the shouts from the crowd and causing a temporary dam across the River Strand.

A minute passed. Britt could feel pressure from the bodies behind as the builder blockage continued to stem the pedestrian tide. Her lungs were being compressed and the air was being squeezed out of them. She was drowning in people. It was time for emergency action.

Britt wrapped her arms around the two large men in suits standing either side of her, shouted an order to push and shoved all her weight into the crowd ahead. The suited men were initially reluctant to join her so she repeated her cry and shoved again – even harder than before. As the suits and others followed her example the tactic began to work. After a third battle cry and thrust, the crowd gained enough momentum to send the construction workers flying forward, their screams stifled by the cheese and pickle sandwiches stuffed in their mouths. Seconds later, the builders were being swept along by the surge. The dam had burst. Britt was finally moving again.

Seconds later, she was scrambling right towards Waterloo Bridge. The crowds were thinner here, so progress was easier."
B01DC3GNCK0,B01DC3GNCK,"Forcing a somewhat pleasant expression on his face, Frederick joined them in the study for a glass of brandy and a cigar. Talk soon circled around to the war, and Frederick once again did his best to retreat into the shadows, hoping to be overlooked.

Unfortunately, it didn’t work.

Although the men’s questions were of a more technical nature, they were no less insensitive. Gritting his teeth, Frederick tried to stay calm as he felt the blood pulsing in his veins. If he could only show these fools that war was neither a game nor a business endeavour!

Before he could explode, his brother placed a hand on his shoulder, steering the conversation back to the Midnight Ball that was to take place in three days. Especially the younger, unmarried gentlemen were eager to discuss the attending ladies, and soon Frederick was able to escape the room in much the same fashion as before.

Shaking his head, he wondered how much more of this he could take before losing his mind.

In the hall, he came upon his mother. As unease seized his heart, he quickly scanned his surroundings for a potential flock of chattering ladies following close on her heel.

A gentle smile came to his mother’s face."
B01DC3GNCK1,B01DC3GNCK,"An anguished moan escaped his mouth, and he rubbed his hands over his face. The one person who would have understood what it felt like to be thrust back into this life was dead. His remains buried somewhere on the continent. Lost and forgotten.

No one who had not walked to the edge of the world and almost fallen off would understand the despair that lived in his heart, poisoning him a little more each day until one day there would be nothing left of him.

Then he would be truly dead.

Frederick hoped that day would come sooner rather than later.

Chapter Three − The Loss of a Friend

Trapped in a drawing room with his mother and his sister-in-law as well as a handful of female visitors, Frederick was ready to shoot himself.

Standing to the side of the armchair Maryann currently occupied, he did his best to blend into the background as the ladies, most of whom had not called on Maryann or his mother in a long time, chatted on eagerly. Again and again, he found adoring eyes sweep over him in a scrutinising manner as though trying to unearth his secrets.

And yet, worse than the stares were the rather uneducated and insensitive questions they asked."

Whatever. I’m sure Brown will get info on this Jared guy like she always does. Then she’ll share it with me, and I hope it’s some good, dirty stuff, like he’s actually a hermaphrodite or an ex-con, or maybe even a stripper. Then I can be grossed out by him, and the embarrassment won’t be mine any longer, but his. I’ll just feel sad for him and his stupid, perfect hair and stupid, perfect blue eyes …

At exactly 5:30 p.m., I pack up my stuff and start heading out to the parking lot. I rarely work late because … well, I hate my job. Why stay late at a place you hate? I don’t have much to get home to though, no plans tonight, per usual. Tonight, I just want to get out of my work clothes, get into some sweats, and relax in front of the television. I need to do something mindless.

Been searching for stuff on the new guy, have come up with nothing yet. Very mysterious. Do you have anything? Meet me downstairs in ten. -B

I wrote her back and made up some excuse for not meeting up with her. I just want to stay in my office and not see anyone today, namely, new guy and Mr. Calhoun. Also, the more times I talk to Brown, the more chances I have of her remembering the stapler and then she’ll grill me about it until I give in.

If I didn’t know Brown better, I’d assume she was trying to find out more info because she was attracted to Jared. But Brown isn’t like that. She just likes to go digging in other people’s business. It’s her thing. Plus, she has a boyfriend that she claims to be totally in love with. I’ve only met Matt a few times when he’s come to a company party or has met Brown for lunch. From what I can gather about him, he’s quite perfect for her, just as good-looking as she is, and also bubbling over with self-esteem.

Summer is over, and I can't recall its even having arrived. I'm stalling again. I don't want to go. My father hasn't ever been there for me. Why should I now have to be there for him? It's not like he'll notice me anyway, what with him being in a coma and all.

But I know I'll go, for the same reason Brad calls me every year with halfhearted invitations to various holiday meals. Because that's what you do. When you have a younger brother living on his own in Manhattan, you call him around the holidays, bursting with artificial familiarity and contrived bonhomie. And when your father has a life-threatening stroke in his sweet spot, you shelve seventeen years of bad blood and drive out to be there. Not to necessarily help, or even offer support, but simply because it's where you belong. Blood will separate, if need be, but its call is primordial, and it won't be refused.

I'm not speaking metaphorically. Just about every highway leaving the island of Manhattan to the north can get you there. You can take the Harlem River Drive to the Cross Bronx Expressway, which becomes the New England Thruway, and ride that all the way up to Bush Falls. Or you can take the Henry Hudson Parkway to the Saw Mill to the Cross County to the Hutchinson River Parkway, then get on the Merritt Parkway, which winds its way in a serpentine trail through the southern half of Connecticut. From the Merritt you pick up I-91, which will take you all the way out to Hartford and just past it to the Falls: more highways, less traffic. Or you can combine the two routes by taking the Merritt and then switching to the Thruway via the I-287 interchange. Despite this veritable smorgasbord of highways, I haven't once, in the last seventeen years, seen fit to take any of them to Bush Falls.

She begins to read his small gnarled handwriting.

There is a whirlwind in southern Morocco, the aajej, against which the fellahin defend themselves with knives. There is the africo, which has at times reached into the city of Rome. The alm, a fall wind out of Yugoslavia. The arifi, also christened aref or rift, which scorches with numerous tongues. These are permanent winds that live in the present tense.

There are other, less constant winds that change direction, that can knock down horse and rider and realign themselves anticlockwise. The bist roz leaps into Afghanistan for 170 days—burying villages. There is the hot, dry ghibli from Tunis, which rolls and rolls and produces a nervous condition. The haboob—a Sudan dust storm that dresses in bright yellow walls a thousand metres high and is followed by rain. The harmattan, which blows and eventually drowns itself into the Atlantic, Imbat, a sea breeze in North Africa. Some winds that just sigh towards the sky. Night dust storms that come with the cold."

She is very quick, her tennis shoes skidding on the numbers she has drawn into each rectangle, one foot landing, then two feet, then one again, until she reaches the last square.

She bends down and picks up the piece of metal, pauses in that position, motionless, her skirt still tucked up above her thighs, hands hanging down loose, breathing hard. She takes a gulp of air and blows out the candle.

Now she is in darkness. Just a smell of smoke.

She leaps up and in midair turns so she lands facing the other way, then skips forward even wilder now down the black hall, still landing on squares she knows are there, her tennis shoes banging and slamming onto the dark floor—so the sound echoes out into the far reaches of the deserted Italian villa, out towards the moon and the scar of a ravine that half circles the building.

He quickly grabbed all of the paperwork he would need, stuffed it into folders and closed and locked his computer. There was only one way that Nacht were allowed to confirm their… uniqueness. He really hoped she wasn’t hungry.

Nathan looked around the bank, but mostly watched the large television that had CNN running. He heard quick footsteps approaching so he pivoted his head to find out what was happening. He didn’t expect anything bad, but he wasn’t a fool, either.

B00IOBQ9VQ0,B00IOBQ9VQ,"These apprentices have the pleasure of watching boats pass while they work, and even glimpse naval ships in the distance headed to Corfu and Cyprus. All day, boatmen tether their gondolas at Master Fumagalli’s boat ramp, waiting in line to have their oars and rowlocks repaired, waxed, replaced.

I hand over my father’s design for the spice merchant’s new gondola, for which he has charged Signor Fumagalli to make the rowlock and oars. The oarmaker rakes his sawdust-covered palms down the front of his leather apron and inspects the drawing through squinted eyes. My father and the oarmaker have never signed a written agreement; there is no need. Signor Fumagalli is like an extension of our family. Signor Fumagalli’s grandfather was once apprenticed to my great-grandfather, but the connections between the two families go back longer than that. The oarmaker has often told me the story of hearing my first cries from our boatyard when I came into the world. This is why, he says, he considers me his nephew even though we are not related by blood. My father laments that the oarmaker has no children; otherwise I am certain that he would have already arranged to marry me off to the oarmaker’s daughter instead of to Annalisa Bonfante."
B00IOBQ9VQ1,B00IOBQ9VQ,"Signor Fumagalli specializes in making fórcole, the rowlocks that secure the oar and allow a boatman to steer his gondola even in the narrowest and most crowded canals. Like my father, Signor Fumagalli is the undisputed master of his trade, a perfectionist who could imagine no other way to spend his days than using his hands to create a masterpiece from a humble block of wood. But the comparisons between the two men end there. Where my father behaves like a despot most of the time, Master Fumagalli possesses a generous soul. Instead of closely guarding his trade secrets, he shares his craft enthusiastically with everyone he meets. Not that anyone else on earth would have the skill to copy the master’s work. His studio teems with visitors, but somehow amidst the chaotic comings and goings, Signor Fumagalli finds the discipline to craft oars and rowlocks that the inspectors hold up to their guild members as examples of the best of their trade.

As I cross the threshold of the remero’s studio, I see the master at his workbench, where he is inspecting a block of walnut, running his hands along the grain as if he were stroking a dog. His eyes are closed."

I could still feel his brown eyes and his electric, electrifying energy—but what had his attentions meant? Was he babysitting me, as Kate’s old friend? Was he still gone on Kate? Was she in love with him? Would I even see him again?

My mind was suddenly such a hive of unanswerable questions that I had to smile at myself. Wasn’t this exactly what I had wanted coming to Chicago, something new to think about? I turned to face the mirror over the bureau. Hadley Richardson was still there, with her auburn waves and thin lips and pale round eyes— but there was something new, too, a glimmer of potential. It was just possible the sun was on its way. In the meantime, I would hum Nora Bayes and do my damnedest to make believe.

Whatever they were, they were living their lives, out there doing it, making their mistakes. Somehow I’d gotten stuck along the way —long before my mother’s illness— and I didn’t know how to free myself exactly.

Sometimes, after playing an hour of passable Chopin, I’d collapse onto the sofa or the carpet, feeling whatever energy I’d had while playing leave my body. It was terrible to feel so empty, as if I were nothing. Why couldn’t I be happy? And just what was happiness anyway? Could you fake it, as Nora Bayes insisted? Could you force it like a spring bulb in your kitchen, or rub up against it at a party in Chicago and catch it like a cold?

Ernest Hemingway was still very much a stranger to me, but he seemed to do happiness all the way up and through. There wasn’t any fear in him that I could see, just intensity and aliveness. His eyes sparked all over everything, all over me as he leaned back on his heel and spun me toward him. He tucked me fast against his chest, his breath warm on my neck and hair."

At the back door, she slipped her stockinged feet into the fake Earth shoes on the porch and headed down the spongy driveway.

The house across the street was long and low to the ground, a rambler-style in an L shape that faced away from the road. Moss furred the shingled roof. The ivory sides were in need of paint, and the gutters were overflowing with leaves and sticks. Giant rhododendron bushes hid most of the windows, runaway junipers created a green spiky barrier that ran the length of the house. No one had tended to the landscaping in years.

At the front door Kate paused, drawing in a deep breath.

Balancing the casserole in one hand, she pulled off one oven mitt and knocked.

Please let no one be home.

Almost instantly she heard footsteps from inside.

The door swung open to reveal a tall woman dressed in a billowy caftan. An Indian-beaded headband circled her forehead. Two mismatched earrings hung from her ears. There was a strange dullness in her eyes, as if she needed glasses and didn’t have them, but even so, she was pretty in a sharp, brittle kind of way."

When she heard tires crunching slowly across gravel, she went back downstairs, washed the dishes, gathered her stuff, and left the house. Outside, the sun was shining, but last night’s rain had studded the driveway with inner-tube-sized potholes. No doubt the old-timers down at the hardware store were already starting to talk about the flooding. Mud sucked at the soles of her fake Earth shoes, making her progress slow. So intent was she on saving her only rainbow socks that she was at the bottom of the driveway before she noticed the girl standing across the street.

She was gorgeous. Tall and big-boobed, she had long, curly auburn hair and a face like Caroline of Monaco: pale skin and full lips and long lashes. And her clothes: low-rise, three-button jeans with huge, tie-died wedges of fabric in the seams to make elephant bells; cork-bottomed platform shoes with four-inch heels; and an angel-sleeved pink peasant blouse that revealed at least two inches of stomach.

Kate clutched her books against her chest, wishing she hadn’t picked her pimples last night. Or that her jeans weren’t Sears Rough Riders."
B01MECUIU40,B01MECUIU4,"They wore similar tan walking shoes, and even the silver wire-rimmed glasses perched on similarly long, thin noses were the same. They looked like a pair of birds, twittering quietly to each other. Clearly they were birders looking to check off a few more species on their life lists. Their appearance and mannerisms were so alike, it was almost as if they had abandoned trying to be individual entities at some point and were now fused into one being.

Watching the older couple share a packet of complimentary in-flight cookies, Nina felt a small pang of—what? Regret that she wouldn’t be sharing cookies with Darren in her golden years? Nostalgia for the ten lost years of her marriage? Maybe, but she also felt something else—relief. Thank God it would not be Darren and her sailing into the sunset. She was no longer responsible for his happiness or his dirty socks. She glanced over at the newlyweds. Thank her lucky stars, also, that she was not just setting out on married life with a guy who thought it was appropriate to wear a baseball cap on an airplane. Nina sniffed. She checked her emotional temperature. No, she did not regret a thing. She felt a tingle of adventure she hadn’t felt in years."
B01MECUIU41,B01MECUIU4,"the boy in a clean and ironed white shirt and pressed navy-blue pants, and the two little girls in fancy party dresses, their hair done up in elaborate braids tied with brightly colored ribbons. They sat quietly on the edges of their seats, looking all around them.

A few rows ahead of Nina sat a couple who looked to be in their early twenties, both a little overweight and very pale, huddled close together and looking out of the small porthole window at the water below. Honeymooners, Nina thought. The young woman wore a flowered dress with a bright-pink cardigan over it and shiny, pink heeled sandals. New clothes bought for this trip, Nina guessed. The woman’s new husband was dressed in blue jeans and a faded black T-shirt with a beer logo on it, a baseball cap with another corporate logo on it, and dirty white sneakers. This was the girl’s idea, thought Nina. She probably spent hours searching for the perfect destination for her dream honeymoon. He just showed up.

Across the aisle from the young pair, a tiny white-haired couple also huddled together. They were looking at a field guide. They were probably about fifty years older than the honeymooners and were dressed in identical khaki shirts, pants, and hats, each wearing a sort of canvas fishing vest with lots of pockets."
B07444W6KK0,B07444W6KK,"At Ashley’s suggestion, every one of them had donned sunglasses, but the biting airflow still made his eyes water so he mostly kept them shut.

His stomach told him that the dragon had begun to descend, so when he felt his sister shifting about in front of him, he opened his eyes. They were below the cloudbank and still over the endless plain. Ian had told them that the open grassland bisected Fairie’s main supercontinent. The northern half was Winter’s realm, all forests and mountains. The southern jungles and marshes belonged to Summer. The dividing belt of flatland was a neutral zone, and their destination lay in that zone, a hundred or so miles west of the portal rocks.

The sight that greeted Mack’s eyes was a massive white city smack dab in the middle of flat green. Below the clouds, the air wasn’t as cold and his sunglasses gave him enough protection to pick out details as Trygon began to circle.

The city was a perfectly symmetrical circle of white marble with main thoroughfares laid out from the center like spokes on a bike’s tire. The connecting streets between the spokes were gentle arcs that formed concentric circles around the massive round hub building that occupied the exact center of the city."
B07444W6KK1,B07444W6KK,"If Declan couldn’t make something, say a water-spelled ring, Mack could easily trade for it from one of the water witches. Trading was easy. Most of the witches would give him stuff just for inside info on Declan. Anything he told them was already cleared by Declan, so he wasn’t going behind his buddy ’s back. And he’d avoided talking to Erika since the incident. Not a big deal; he just figured it was wiser to avoid the temptation of letting his fast, wiseass mouth dig him a hole. But the unexpected side effect was that Declan followed suit. Every witch in the school noticed that consequence. Hard to get with the most powerful male witch in the world if he wouldn’t talk to you, look at you, or spend more than a few seconds near you on behalf of his roommate, although truth be told, not a one of them had a chance to begin with. Not over Stacia.

So the end result was Erika going out of her way to be nice to Mack just to earn the right to at least talk to Declan. But Mack had never forgotten the shit spell and never forgot that magic amulets can’t protect you from everything.

Anyway, dragon riding was cold."
B00IH487I80,B00IH487I8,"I felt hot tears rush to my eyes, but I refused to allow them to fall. Instead, I raised my eyes to a huge chandelier that had crystals hanging from it that reflected the candlelight into every imaginable color of gorgeous, dancing prismatic patterns. It was beautiful, and could easily be a focal point while I endured the Horde King’s attention.

I would have to endure him long enough for him to think I was subdued. Hopefully he would forget all about me once he had his way, and I could leave this place and never look back. First, I had to gain his trust to ditch the chains, since, like the necklace, they probably kept me from sifting.

There was nothing else inside the room; not at first glance, anyway. I could just make out shelves, but couldn’t bring the items on them into focus. I was squinting when Alazander sifted in.

He stopped briefly to examine me, and then held his hand up, and a glass goblet rimmed in gold and filled with a light blue liquid appeared in it. He smiled and took a long sip before he brought it down and held it against my lips."
B00IH487I81,B00IH487I8,"The room was dark, and the walls were a light gray stone. Huge glass chandeliers hung from the high ceilings on metal poles that held them firmly in place above the tables, and threw soft flickering light against the stone and assembly of the Horde creatures that were present. All I could guess was that it was some sort of great hall or a gargantuan meeting hall of some kind. I was still wrapped in the electrical hold of the king as he shouted off orders in a language that I couldn’t understand. This was odd, as so far I had understood all of the different dialects that the High Fae spoke in Faery. I seemed to be included in those orders as I was quickly pulled away from him by two of his guards, who took me down a long winding stairway that led to a richly decorated room.

The room leapt to life as the door was opened and I was pushed through the doorway by one of the guards. The stone walls of the vast room sparkled like crystal was embedded in it, and reflected the many candles that were scattered throughout the room. I stumbled but easily caught my balance and turned toward the guards."
B079MGWXK60,B079MGWXK6,"I didn’t know her well; we had never spoken to each other, although we were constantly competing, in class and outside it. But in a confused way I felt that if I ran away with the others I would leave with her something of mine that she would never give back.

At first I stayed hidden, around a corner, and leaned out to see if Lila was coming. Then, since she wouldn’t budge, I forced myself to rejoin her; I handed her stones, and even threw some myself. But I did it without conviction: I did many things in my life without conviction; I always felt slightly detached from my own actions. Lila, on the other hand, had, from a young age — I can’t say now precisely if it was so at six or seven, or when we went together up the stairs that led to Don Achille’s and were eight, almost nine—the characteristic of absolute determination. Whether she was gripping the tricolor shaft of the pen or a stone or the handrail on the dark stairs, she communicated the idea that whatever came next—thrust the pen with a precise motion into the wood of the desk, dispense inky bullets, strike the boys from the countryside, climb the stairs to Don Achille’s door —she would do without hesitation."
B079MGWXK61,B079MGWXK6,"You could die if you chewed American gum and inadvertently swallowed it. You could die if you banged your temple. The temple, in particular, was a fragile place, we were all careful about it. Being hit with a stone could do it, and throwing stones was the norm. When we left school a gang of boys from the countryside, led by a kid called Enzo or Enzuccio, who was one of the children of Assunta the fruit and vegetable seller, began to throw rocks at us. They were angry because we were smarter than them. When the rocks came at us we ran away, except Lila, who kept walking at her regular pace and sometimes even stopped. She was very good at studying the trajectory of the stones and dodging them with an easy move that today I would call elegant. She had an older brother and maybe she had learned from him, I don’t know, I also had brothers, but they were younger than me and from them I had learned nothing. Still, when I realized that she had stayed behind, I stopped to wait for her, even though I was scared.

Already then there was something that kept me from abandoning her."
B00BIV49FC0,B00BIV49FC,"He was a very young man with soft brown hair that looked as though it had been cut with the aid of a soup bowl, and a gentle, kind-eyed face. He had an unworldly air about him, like some dedicated novice, and Olivia found it hard to believe that he had successfully come so far along the rat race of his chosen profession without getting his throat cut.

They stood by the table at the window of her office, where he had laid out a selection of his past work for her inspection: two dozen or so large, glossy colour prints hopefully displayed for approval. Olivia had studied them minutely and decided that she liked them. In the first place, they were lucid. Fashion photographs, she always insisted, must show the clothes, the shape of them, the drape of a skirt, the texture of a sweater, and this came across with a punchy impact that would catch any eye. But as well, the pictures breathed with life, movement, enjoyment, even tenderness.

She picked one up. A man with the build of a full-back jogging through surf, blinding white track suit against a cobalt-blue sea. Tanned skin, sweat, the very smell of salty air and physical well-being."
B00BIV49FC1,B00BIV49FC,"Very old, very tall, growing frail, leaning on a silver-handled stick , he had stood on the platform by the open window and kissed Penelope goodbye. His white hair had lain long on the tweed collar of his Inverness cape, and on his twisted, deformed hands he wore woollen mittens from which the useless fingers protruded, white and bloodless as bones.

At the very last moment, even as the train started to move, Penelope had snatched Nancy up into her arms, and the old man had reached out a hand and laid it against Nancy’s rounded baby cheek. She remembered the cold of his hand, like marble against her skin. There was no time for more. The train gathered speed, the platform curved away, he stood, growing smaller, waving his great broad-brimmed black hat in a final farewell. And that was Nancy’s first and last memory of him, for he died the following year.

Ancient history, she told herself. Nothing to get sentimental about. But extraordinary that any person, nowadays, should want to buy his work. The Water Carriers. She shook her head, uncomprehending, and then abandoned the conundrum and turned happily to the comforting unrealities of the Social Diary.

OLIVIA

The new photographer was called Lyle Medwin."
B077BFHZGM0,B077BFHZGM,"I was reasonably certain the land in Verald would survive while I was away, but a bit of extra pumpkin soup never hurt. I made a mental note to ask the king how he was going to keep his subjects fed. Everyone had just been taking what they wanted thus far, but with the king now coronated, he’d soon have to establish order.

As I began my climb up the mountain pass to the castle, I pulled down my sleeves to cover the blue scales. The iridescent gem-like additions to my body hadn’t disappeared since I awoke, and they weren’t the only noticeable difference. My mind must’ve been playing tricks because my teeth seemed awfully sharp, and my sense of smell was quite a lot better. Happy birthday to me.

I chuckled nervously, feeling dizzy. Those things probably meant nothing. My being Drae still wasn’t certain. My gaze fell to my arms, the scales beneath my shirt calling my bluff.

Reaching the castle gates, I halted and sat on a mound of grass directly outside them. I crossed my legs in my ankle-length, practical, brown skirt, smoothing my deep-blue aketon over the top. Assuming I’d need to wait here for a while, I sank my hands into the ground and sent my Phaetyn mojo out."
B077BFHZGM1,B077BFHZGM,"Harvest Zone Seven was filled with fields of blue flowers, the shape of the metal one my mother took me to during my childhood. In the moonlight, my vibrant blooms glowed. Thinking about them, I wondered if maybe it hadn’t been that hard for the Phaetyn prince and emperor to find me. The pressure of my emotions built behind my eyes as I moved between the thick stalks of blossoms, but I shoved the feelings back, instead concentrating on the soft petals as I trailed my fingers over them. Those blooms I touched flared with light, standing to attention as I passed.

They were Tyrs as I’d named them. Tears to everyone else who didn’t know about the man I’d fallen in love with while captive. A gentle, kind, caring soul who I’d believed I could’ve spent the rest of my life with. If he’d been real.

I sighed, walking across the Market Circuit, the ring road that went through all twelve Harvest Zones. I entered into the quota fields on the other side of that, trudging through a field of pumpkins. Not one to miss an opportunity, I spat on my hands and touched the pumpkins as I passed, willing them to be huge tomorrow."
B01FZZHXR20,B01FZZHXR2,"His ass would hurt too much and his gut would grow too soft.

He always got the regret, but it would subside after a day or two. These first hours were the hardest for him, and that was why he volunteered to drive the first shift. He needed to get the regret out of the way. In six more hours, he would sleep, and when he woke again, the feeling would be gone.

He grabbed for his coffee mug, but stopped when he remembered it was empty. He had made the same mistake numerous times since he had swallowed the last tepid drop.

Simon was still snoring in the bunk in the back, so Larry was left alone with only his thoughts to keep him company, and he never really much enjoyed his own company. He didn't feel like listening to music, so after the preacher had finished, he just switched off the radio. He tried conversing over the CB, but he only found one person willing to chat. His handle was Chugs. Larry found him obnoxious and inaccessible, and soon changed the frequency.

Larry's thumb twitched against his thigh, and then the steering wheel, and then his thigh again. He couldn't stand it anymore."
B01FZZHXR21,B01FZZHXR2,"He was making one final check of the route that they would be taking from Bumfuck, South Carolina to San Diego, California. It would be the farthest trip that Larry or Simon had ever made since joining the trucking profession.

Microchips.

Goddamn millions of microchips, delivered by ship to a Carolina port and placed on the semi-truck trailer that the two brothers, Larry and Simon Pluckett, would navigate across the United States.

Larry hated computers. He hated the Internet. He even hated his phone, though he saw the value in having it. So, the fact that Larry would be moving a truck full of microchips such a distance almost made him want to turn down the job. However, he swallowed his pride. The fact was that they needed money, and this job was going to pay them enough to get by for at least three months. He and his brother had not had the greatest run of luck as of late, and what little cash they had stashed away had dried up faster than an earth worm in the Carolina sun.

Goddamn microchips.

As he folded up his map, satisfied that the route he had chosen was the best possible, Larry noticed Simon finishing off his mug of coffee. He checked his own travel mug and found it almost empty."
B06XC7RVBV0,B06XC7RVBV,"Blood, tears, noise, and despite all that, all I could think about was dessert.

I should’ve asked for sprinkles.

For a moment, when I return, I think she is gone; she is well hidden in the shadows. Only her reflection on the window betrays her. I am admittedly a bit shocked, but only just; I did, after all, buy two cones. I like to be prepared for any eventuality, including the unlikeliest.

Somehow I manage to fumble a key in the lock, open the door, and slide in without tipping the cones. She hardly reacts except to reach up and feebly take her ice cream from my hand. And now she has her vanilla, and I have my orange sherbet, which I can safely eat without dying since it is egg-free. The list of things I am unable to eat is almost as long as the list of people I have killed. Likely longer.

I turn on the light and watch her little pink tongue carve icy little troughs, trying to think of words. Sentences. Conversation. For a few minutes, there is nothing but licking and the little panting gasps between licks as we catch our breaths."
B06XC7RVBV1,B06XC7RVBV,"They will search their databases and find no match, because I do not exist there. Over the next few weeks, they will look for patterns, but I will not do what I just did ever again. I will not revisit the scene of the crime, no matter what. I am not in this for fame, or infamy. This is what I do. And so I will probably get away. As I have before. And, hopefully, will again.

Still, a healthy paranoia keeps me checking mirrors for flashing lights, which is how I notice her watching me in the rear view, jagged arcs down her cheeks, dark smears interrupting the current where her hands have tried to wipe it away. Everything is just gray on gray in the evening light, but every time a car passes there is a moment when everything is all lit up in red, like a warning. A vivid reminder that while they might not be looking for me, they will be looking for her. She is a liability. A ticking bomb full of baby teeth.

We exit at 234 and I migrate south. There is a long light at Lomond, and with two minutes of silence to fill I peek in the mirror. Words, words. Say something."
B06Y17N4YG0,B06Y17N4YG,"If you are a reporter and you are good at it, it’s not an avocation you are pursuing. It’s your mission, your you.

Journalism, as Bill has always seen it, is the solid core of the universe surrounded by nebulae; feathery, cold, unexplored, a soft, vertical wilderness. As these images start to spin around him, he is coming to terms with being ejected into that realm of disconnected irrelevance, the vast kingdom of uselessness. It’s a good thing Bill isn’t prone to crying— he considers displays of emotion unmanly. Had this not been the case, he might have started to cry and never stopped.

Things sucked for Bill from the outset of his career, or his mission, or whatever it is, or was. His curse: when he was in his prime, Americans could accept an immigrant in almost any role—a doctor, especially in an obscure abbadaba subspecialty, an engineer, even a Web security consultant— but not as an investigative journalist. Bill could reach the top tiers, never achieving the pinnacle. Something about the ever-so-subtle remnants of his Russian tonality and his so-unpronounceable and so-unspellable name—a name he sometimes, for the sake of user-friendliness, abbreviates as KZB and WKZB—made the doorkeepers bar the entrance to the club."
B06Y17N4YG1,B06Y17N4YG,"At thirty, shortly after joining the Post, he stopped making references to castrations with dull, rusted blades. By forty, he mellowed a bit more and stopped likening the art of writing stories to the act of shoving broomsticks—indeed, entire brooms—up the recti of people who had betrayed the public trust: corrupt government officials, avaricious CEOs, data-cooking scientists.

At one point, Bill proposed developing a scale for measuring impact in inches shoved, and in 1998, a group of interns presented him with just the broomstick he proposed. It was a fond gift for what amounted to contributing to delinquency of newsroom minors.

This broomstick was to be aimed at proverbial, as opposed to corporeal, assholes. In the newsroom parlance of the post-Watergate era, a broomstick salute seemed to be a fitting punishment. A good investigative story is a weapon, the enemy is the enemy, and denying humanity of the enemy is a requirement in all combat, including the combat that is journalism.

For nearly two decades Bill kept the broomstick hidden behind a filing cabinet near his desk, a time-capsule-preserved artifact from the days he thought such things were funny. He moved and rehid the broomstick when the Post relocated to its techy new quarters."
B01I0X2YR00,B01I0X2YR0,"Hordes of people who didn’t belong were sure to invade a crime scene, minutes after the police had been called in. Maniacs of all sorts and flavors owned police radios, from newspeople to plain amateurs who got a thrill out of seeing dead bodies. She’d asked someone about it, one of the profilers from Quantico. He’d said that seeing death is, in a weird way, a celebration of one’s life, of being alive. It’s the reason some couples have sex after attending funerals. A sick world, that’s what it was. Yeah.

Reluctant crowds parted, brought to compliance by the red and blue strobes on her car, and she managed to park in parallel with the coroner’s van. The body was still there; good. If she hurried a little, she could maybe catch it as it was found, before the coroner loaded it into the van.

She hopped out of her SUV and slammed the door, then approached the police line with a spring in her step, ignoring the soft sand that had already filled her shoes. Two detectives, most likely the first at the scene, approached the line from the other side. She ran her long, thin fingers through her shoulder-length, blonde hair, then pulled out her badge."
B01I0X2YR01,B01I0X2YR0,"A couple of terrible seconds later, he was on his way to the cordoned area, walking with his back almost straight, even if he moved a little slower than usual.

The lifeguard tower was already surrounded by yellow police line on improvised stakes stuck in the sand. The first respondent team had been fast, doing their jobs at securing the scene. Michowsky stopped at the line, hesitant. Bending to go under the line as he usually did was out of the question. He decided to go around it, seeing that the line didn’t extend all the way into the water. He walked as quickly as he could and managed to go around the line just as the coroner’s van pulled in, its wheels half-buried into the soft sand.

He reached the lifeguard tower and caught the first clear view of the victim. He almost gasped. The victim’s posturing was shocking, making her appear alive. Completely naked, she was kneeled on the sand, slightly bent forward, but her back was straight and her head upright. She was strikingly beautiful, even in death. He shook his head bitterly. Sometimes his job made him sick, disgusted with life, with the monsters of mankind."
B01N9PTM350,B01N9PTM35,"The schoolmaster’s name had been Mr. Musial, and when he introduced himself Ella had misheard him, and although she never spoke his name she always thought of it as Musical. Mr. Musical had been short and thin and well dressed like Goldberg’s brother, but unlike Goldberg’s brother, Mr. Musical had a violent limp that wrenched his face into a grimace when he walked. Ella and Wesley had heard that he’d served in the Civil War, and she’d imagined that he’d been a hero and had suffered his injury in battle, but in reality an angry horse had taken a bite from his thigh and gangrene had set in; he’d lost the leg just above the knee and had never even shot the rifle he’d never learned to load. The schoolchildren did not know, no one in the small community actually knew, but Mr. Musical’s leg was made of wood from the hip down, his knee joint nothing but a shiny metal socket that swung wildly no matter how slowly he walked or how much he struggled to control his gait.

A chair sat in front of Goldberg’s brother’s desk, but he did not ask Ella to sit down so she did not sit. He pushed himself back from his desk and put his hands in his lap. His thin lips formed a straight line."
B01N9PTM351,B01N9PTM35,"They drank whiskey and slung rifles across their backs.

Two days later the governor called in the National Guard. Women were beaten. Soldiers pressed guns to men’s heads. The strikers’ first headquarters had been destroyed by a nighttime mob. The union commissary attacked, the food stores ruined.

The first leaflets had begun trickling through the mill in early April, carried by whispers and subtle passes from hand to hand. Ella had held on to the first one she’d seen, had kept it with her ever since. Another leaflet had come through American just a few days ago. Union members were being forcibly removed from the Loray village on Monday, May 6, just two days away. All workers in the surrounding area were invited to a rally on Sunday evening. The union would even pick you up, take you there.

Ella looked again at the list of union demands. She had a decision to make.

Goldberg’s brother’s voice spoke from behind the door, and Ella wondered if, godlike, he’d been able to sense that her mind had just wandered from her job at American to the strike at Loray. She folded the leaflet and slipped it into her pocket, slid the pencil back behind her ear."
B071PC3T8C0,B071PC3T8C,"I watch Des—wings and all—as he saunters out of the room, a towel wrapped low around his waist.

Once he gets to the far side of the bed, his towel drops to the ground, and holy virgins and saints, that backside is everything.

I wrap my own towel the best I can around myself, accidently plucking a few of my feathers in the process, my eyes fixed on the Bargainer. I am absolutely creeping on this man right now and I have zero regrets.

He glances over his shoulder at me, his pale hair slicked back. I should be embarrassed that he caught me blatantly ogling him, but his own expression heats at whatever he sees in mine.

We still haven’t done anything together—naked espresso-drinking and macaroon-eating aside—and the need to rectify that situation is beginning to grow.

I wring out my hair as I pad into his bedroom, the hanging lanterns above us glowing softly.

I’m about to head over to the fancy armoire already stocked with a million fae outfits for me when Des reaches into a dresser drawer near the bed and tosses me a black piece of clothing. I catch it, the material soft beneath my fingertips."
B071PC3T8C1,B071PC3T8C,"Des mounts the steps to his throne and takes a seat next to me, all while the bog continues to swallow the fairy.

I dig my fingernails into my seat as I hear the man’s cries. I have every reason to enjoy the justice of this moment, but now that the Fauna fae looks less like a villain and more like a victim, I find I can’t.

I don’t want to sit here and watch this. It’s too inhuman, too fae, too wicked. All at once it becomes too much.

I get up and, amongst the screams and the stares, I leave the room.

No one stops me.

Chapter 4

I stand out on the balcony connected to Des’s royal suite, the night sky glittering above me. After leaving his throne room, I wandered the palace grounds for a bit before eventually finding my way back here.

Far below me, I can make out fairies coming and going across the palace grounds. Beyond them is the city of Somnia.

I don’t know how long I’ve been leaning over the railing, watching this terribly foreign world pass me by. Long enough for me to question just about every life decision that led me here."
B01ARMFX2U0,B01ARMFX2U,"Fletcher was the baking godmother to my tearoom Cinderella and, without him, my little business would never have had a chance. Cassie had been the one who had suggested him when I was looking for a chef for the tearoom. She taught occasional classes at the dance studio in the village —another of her many jobs — and she’d met Fletcher when he came in to fix the broken ceiling fan. He was sort of an unofficial handyman in Meadowford—helping the local residents with odd jobs— but he was also known for being a brilliant baker. Cassie had insisted that I consider hiring him for the tearoom.

I’d been doubtful at first: after all, Fletcher wasn’t a trained chef and I’d been thinking of getting someone with a proper qualification. But when I’d tasted one of his scones, I hired him on the spot. Cassie was right, his baking was divine. And funnily enough, giving Fletcher the job had won me brownie points with the villagers, who had been bracing themselves for some snooty chef from London.

The arrival of a group of Chinese tourists put a stop to my reminiscing and I hurried to seat them and hand out menus.

B01ARMFX2U1,B01ARMFX2U,"He thought a moment, then nodded and stood up, shuffling to the back of the room to collect his things and the cat carrier. I’d been meaning to speak to him about the feasibility of continuing to bring Muesli to work every day—especially after the disaster this morning— so I followed him as he went to get her.

Muesli woke up as we entered the shop area and arched her back in a perfect cat stretch, then yawned widely, showing sharp white fangs in a little pink mouth. She looked none the worse for wear after her adventures that morning. She came trotting up to me with her tail in the air and rubbed herself against my legs. I wanted to be mad at her—if it hadn’t been for her, none of the fiasco would have happened—but looking down at that cheeky little face, with her bright green eyes and tiny, heart-shaped nose, I felt myself soften. Almost involuntarily, I crouched down and reached out to stroke her. Her fur was silky soft, a pale dove grey patterned with a series of darker grey stripes across her body, broken only by the white on her chest and paws. She climbed onto my lap, kneading with her front paws and purring like an engine."
B002GEDEKG0,B002GEDEKG,"And for the first time it occurred to Kristin that there was something about her mother that was not as it should be—that she was different from other women.

As she stood and pondered this, a maidservant came up to her and asked her to go up to the loft to her father.

But when she stepped into the loft room Kristin forgot all about tending to him, for across from the open doorway, with the light shining directly in her face, sat a small woman, whom she realized must be the witch —although Kristin had not expected her to look like that.

She seemed as small as a child, and delicate, for she was sitting in the big high-backed chair that had been brought up to the room. A table had also been placed in front of her, covered with Ragnfrid’s finest embroidered linen cloth. Pork and fowl were set forth on silver platters, there was wine in a bowl of curly birchwood, and she had Lavrans’s own silver goblet to drink from. She had finished eating and was wiping her small, slender hands on one of Ragnfrid’s best towels. Ragnfrid herself stood in front of her, holding a brass basin of water."
B002GEDEKG1,B002GEDEKG,"Tordis found Kristin asleep there in the corner late in the day, and she took her indoors. The child hadn’t eaten a thing since morning. Tordis kept vigil with Ragnfrid over Ulvhild that night, and Kristin lay in her bed with Jon, Tordis’s husband, and Eivind and Orm, her little boys. The smell of their bodies, the man’s snoring, and the even breathing of the two children made Kristin quietly weep. Only the night before she had lain in bed, as she had every night of her life, with her own father and mother and little Ulvhild. It was like thinking about a nest that had been torn apart and scattered, and she herself had been flung from the shelter and wings that had always warmed her. At last she cried herself to sleep, alone and miserable among all those strangers.

On the following morning when Kristin got up, she learned that her uncle and his entire entourage had left Jørundgaard—in anger. Trond had called his sister a crazy, demented woman and her husband a spineless fool who had never learned to rein in his wife. Kristin grew flushed with rage, but she was also ashamed. She realized that a grave impropriety had taken place when her mother had driven her closest kinsmen from the manor."
B000OCXIRG0,B000OCXIRG,"Ralph stood up and trotted along to the right.

Here the beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the landscape; a great platform of pink granite thrust up uncompromisingly through forest and terrace and sand and lagoon to make a raised jetty four feet high. The top of this was covered with a thin layer of soil and coarse grass and shaded with young palm trees. There was not enough soil for them to grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twenty feet they fell and dried, forming a criss-cross pattern of trunks, very convenient to sit on. The palms that still stood made a green roof, covered on the underside with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon. Ralph hauled himself onto this platform, noted the coolness and shade, shut one eye, and decided that the shadows on his body were really green. He picked his way to the seaward edge of the platform and stood looking down into the water. It was clear to the bottom and bright with the efflorescence of tropical weed and coral. A school of tiny, glittering fish flicked hither and thither. Ralph spoke to himself, sounding the bass strings of delight."
B000OCXIRG1,B000OCXIRG,"He became conscious of the weight of clothes, kicked his shoes off fiercely and ripped off each stocking with its elastic garter in a single movement. Then he leapt back on the terrace, pulled off his shirt, and stood there among the skull-like coconuts with green shadows from the palms and the forest sliding over his skin. He undid the snake-clasp of his belt, lugged off his shorts and pants, and stood there naked, looking at the dazzling beach and the water.

He was old enough, twelve years and a few months, to have lost the prominent tummy of childhood and not yet old enough for adolescence to have made him awkward. You could see now that he might make a boxer, as far as width and heaviness of shoulders went, but there was a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil. He patted the palm trunk softly, and, forced at last to believe in the reality of the island laughed delightedly again and stood on his head. He turned neatly on to his feet, jumped down to the beach, knelt and swept a double armful of sand into a pile against his chest. Then he sat back and looked at the water with bright, excited eyes."
B000OCXI580,B000OCXI58,"She cried out in triumph as the dark smoke of black magic streamed inside her, smearing and choking out what she had been, what she had vowed. What she had believed.

This, she thought as her cupped hands trembled at the force and the greed, was better. What had come before was pale and weak, a soft belly, compared to the strength and muscle of what was now.

She could do all and any. She could take and could rule. There was nothing and no one to stop her.

In a mad dance she spun across the sand, above it, her arms spread like wings, her hair falling in coils like snakes. She could taste the death of her sister’s murderer, the bright copper flavor of blood she’d spilled, and knew she had never supped so well.

Her laughter shot out like bolts, cracked the black bowl of the sky. A torrent of dark rain fell and hissed on the sand like acid.

He called her.

Somewhere through the wild night and her own fury she heard his voice. The faint glow of what had been inside her struggled to burn brighter.

She saw him, just a shadow fighting through the wind and rain to reach her. Love warred and wept in a heart gone cold."
B000OCXI581,B000OCXI58,"Ripley balled her hand as Nell walked away. Her skin still hummed from the contact. Sneaky little witch, Ripley thought.

She had to admire that.

Dreams came late in the night, when her mind was open and her will at rest. She could deny by day, close herself off, stand by the choice she’d made more than a decade before.

But sleep was a power of its own, and seduced the dreaming.

In dreams, she stood on the beach, where the waves rose like terror. They pounded, black and bitter, on the shore, a thousand mad heartbeats, under a blind sky.

The only light was the snake-whips of lightning that slashed each time she raised her arms. And the light that came from her was a furious gold edged with murderous red.

The wind roared.

The violence of it, the sheer, unharnessed power of it, thrilled her in some deep and secret place. She was beyond now, beyond right, beyond rules.

Beyond hope.

And part of her, still flickering, wept grievous tears for the loss.

She had done what she had done, and now wrongs were avenged. Death to death to death. A circle formed by hate. One times three."
B073HHG1Y80,B073HHG1Y8,"I was always unhappy when he left, because, frankly, the relatives who took me in Paris didn’t want to have anything to do with me. I don’t blame them. I was a difficult child. But he saw through that. They had a little garden in which there was a hose for watering the plants and the grass. I played there, or brooded. One day in late September he had to leave, and a taxi was waiting to take him to the station. He came downstairs and into the garden to say goodbye to me. He was wearing a beautifully tailored suit. What did I do? Because I didn’t want him to go, I sprayed him with the hose. He got soaking wet and cold, but he had no time to change because he had to catch the train. I was scolded like a murderer, but he intervened and said it was all right. The way he looked at me told me that he understood and still loved me. Two months later he was dead from melanoma. What did I know? I thought he had become sick because of the chill. I thought for years that I had killed him. I know of course that I didn’t. It doesn’t matter."
B073HHG1Y81,B073HHG1Y8,"A short, bearded man with glasses – the fashion after Freud – he stood at the soundproofed door to his office and looked at his prospective patient, who was older than he was, though not by much. Despite the fact that he was one of the few psychiatrists present in the city in August, Dunaif’s prestige in the profession was legendary. Ignorant of that, Jules had found him in the telephone book, his fourteenth call.

Dunaif stood in silence, studying Jules as one might study a painting. People see so many other people that they look at faces without seeing them. But so much is written in the face – of the past, of truth, hope, pain, love, and potential – that each man or woman deserves a Raphael, Rembrandt, or Vermeer to see and express it.

What did Dunaif see? He supposed that the man standing before him, like so many – but here it was carved to an unusual depth – carried within him and would not abandon the life of the past, his love of those who had come before, a store of vivid memories, and, not least, the wounds of history. A smart, brave, and defeated old man sitting in front of the doctor, reticent as he might be, was more interesting than listening to the sexual travails or career disappointments of a twenty-eight-year-old."
B0733C5L4T0,B0733C5L4T,"The black wooden door, immense and shining with glossy paint, had been pulled full back and, either side of it on the white stone steps stood a footman. The two footmen were dressed in the very finest livery, better even than the Earl’s own men wore. Lord Seaton’s men wore long tailcoats in heavy cream-coloured brocade. In truth, it seemed a little too heavy for the warmth of the afternoon, although it was unlikely that the comfort of Lord Seaton’s servants was of great concern to him.

Beneath the immaculate tailcoats, the two footmen wore equally heavy waistcoats in a rich golden colour with intricate embroidery upon the fabric. The black knee breeches they wore were neatly met by brilliant white stockings, a look which Heath thought a little ostentatious given the current fashion for somewhat longer trousers and knee length boots. To maintain footman in the breeches, stockings, and buckle-fronted shoes struck Heath as a little regal.

As they approached the steps, Heath almost laughed when he saw his mother making a fine study of the two footmen. For a few moments, he wondered how long it would be before his own footman were returned to the more old-fashioned yet very rich style that the Seatons had employed."
B0733C5L4T1,B0733C5L4T,"It was all very well to take for granted the fact that she would always be there whether he put the effort in or not, but with her age had come a good deal of wisdom, and with that wisdom, he had sensed an ever-widening chasm between them.

Relations between Heath and Prudence had become such that he felt sure any marriage of hers would sever all ties as far as Prudence was concerned. After all, what did she really have to hold onto at Reddington Hall? A mother who had made it clear that she was an encumbrance to be married off at the first opportunity to a man who did not covet a large dowry? Or a brother who had allowed things to go on most unfairly because it suited his selfish purposes? No, once Prudence had found a husband and a life of her own, Heath had no doubt in his mind that she would never look back. If ever there was a time to try to win back her favour, it was now before it was too late. And of course, it might already be too late. Prudence was almost one and twenty and strikingly beautiful. She had his extraordinarily dark hair and bright blue eyes, but none of his height. Prudence was little and neat, and Heath would not be at all surprised if she caught the attention of some fine gentleman or other during the upcoming Season."

From: Gemma

Subject: Kara

Dear Lyn,

I don’t know how to set up an address book but thank you for the thought. I don’t mean to alarm you but have you heard of SHAKING BABY SYNDROME? I think leaving Maddie with Kara could be very dangerous. Once I saw her shaking a box of cornflakes FURIOUSLY. She is a teenager and teenagers have problems with their hormones that cause them to be just a little insane. Can’t you ask Cat, once she has finished her bad mood? Or else I could cancel my date with the luscious locksmith. I am prepared to do that to save Maddie’s life. Let me know. Love, Gemma

Cat wondered if her face looked different. It felt different, as if it were bruised and swollen. Both her eyes as if like they’d been punched. In fact, her whole body seemed strangely fragile. She’d been holding herself stiffly all day, as if she were sunburned.

It was surprising really, how much this hurt and how consistently it hurt. All day at work she kept thinking that she ought to get a painkiller and then remembering that she wasn’t actually in physical pain.

She hadn’t slept much the night before."
B0014H32E41,B0014H32E4,"An exquisite twist of her heart because this girl actually had a name and Dan knew her name.

She gazed at her dinner congealing on her plate, and she could see every snakelike strand of spaghetti in nauseating definition. The lens of a telescope had been clicked, and her previously blurry world was now in sharp-edged focus.

She stared with new eyes at their living room. Casually angled cushions on the sofa, bright wacky rug on polished floorboards. The bookshelf, lined with photos, each one carefully selected and framed as evidence of their happy, active lives. Look! We’re so loving and cosmopolitan, so fit and humorous! Here we are smiling and hugging in our ski gear! Here we are having a laugh before we go scuba diving! We party with our friends! We pull ironic faces at the camera!

She looked back at Dan. He was quite a good-looking man, her husband. It used to worry her in a pleasurable, not-really-worried way.

He’s been unfaithful to me, she thought, trying it out. It was bizarre. Surreal. Part of her wanted to switch the television back on and pretend it had never happened. I have to iron my skirt for tomorrow, she thought. I should do my Christmas list."
B073X6XWLM0,B073X6XWLM,"I promised myself I wouldn’t stalk James on social media. But right now, on the cusp of making another huge life change, I need to see how he’s doing. How he’s coping with everything being shaken up. I take a deep breath and quickly click it.

His image flashes up on the screen. Just two minutes ago, he posted a photo. He’s sitting on a stool at a bamboo counter, the blazing orange horizon in the background. He’s already looking tanned, relaxed, happy, a mojito in hand. His eyes look brighter, like he’s been laughing. I study the photo more carefully and see new, unfamiliar chunky black markings on his forearm. The tattoo he’s wanted for years. Something he wanted that I talked him out of. I look to his naked wedding finger. There’s no tan line, no mark to say that this is out of the ordinary, that this is unusual.

This is the new normal. Me sitting at the kitchen table on a Saturday night wondering what life is happening elsewhere. Someone is typing in the comment box under his photo. Living the dream, mate! Our break-up has given my ex-husband wings. Whereas I feel as though mine have been clipped."
B073X6XWLM1,B073X6XWLM,"And right now I feel like my life has to be completely shaken up and rearranged to help me find the one I’m meant to lead.

Set your sights on the sky and reach for the stars.

As children, every time we faced something that seemed insurmountable – from long division to cross-country races – we’d run down the lane to Dad, crying and kicking and insisting that we couldn’t do it, we weren’t ready for it yet. Too much, too hard, too impossible. And he’d tell us that the outcome was of no concern to him; it would take care of itself and be joyous as long as we were willing to begin. That was all we had to do: set our sights, start well and he would be proud of us.

Tara’s right. He’d want me to begin to make my life again. Begin with tears in my eyes, pain in my heart, empty pockets and a broken past, but begin. Everything needs a beginning. And once you begin, who knows what adventure awaits? Reach for the stars and you’ll land somewhere higher than you ever imagined.

I open my laptop, my finger hovering over the Facebook icon."
B01MEEWFIC0,B01MEEWFIC,"She navigated her way to his desk and took a stack of drawings that he’d been protective of last time she’d entered his room.

She sat down on the floor and rifled through. Most of the illustrations were of machines and robots, good efforts for a little guy. She came across one drawing that caught her attention, a chain-link fence surrounding a series of radio towers. Much like the towers on the top of Red Mountain. Without hesitation, she ran back downstairs, trying fruitlessly to reach her dad by cell.

She ran into the garage, pushed the button opening the sliding door, and climbed onto one of the other ATVs, something she’d spent plenty of hours on in the past. She revved up the motor and sped out onto the driveway and turned into their vineyards. Going over thirty miles an hour, bouncing up and down, she roared past Lacoda.

She slowed as she started the steeper part of the climb to the top of Red Mountain, which wasn’t the tallest mountain in the world, but certainly a daunting piece of geography for an eight-year-old. She saw him, two miles from the house, hiking up the last of the slope with a walking stick and a backpack."
B01MEEWFIC1,B01MEEWFIC,"Another half-mile past the winery, she reached her home, designed by the same architect and built at the same time as Lacoda. A mammoth stone wall surrounded their home, a necessary evil of celebrity life.

In 2004, a man who was now in prison had broken into their home in Seattle and attacked her mom. Luckily, her dad had been there and was able to subdue the intruder, breaking his arm and nose in the process, which only proved to further ignite record sales. They’d employed a bodyguard for several years after the attack, but as the band members aged, they’d lost some of their spotlight on the world stage, and her parents had decided things had become much safer.

Emilia pressed the button on the gate-opener, and the metal doors swung out. Her mother hurried to her car, clearly troubled. Though Emilia loved her mom, she couldn't help feeling scorn for the woman. Carmen Forester had made her name and her living off her cover girl looks, and her exterior defined her. It drove Emilia crazy. Even in her fifties, the woman was severely concerned about her appearance: her wrinkles, her sags, her makeup, her clothes, blah blah blah, as if age was consuming her identity one gray hair at a time."
B00EBRU05I0,B00EBRU05I,"I can speak German, Italian, English and Spanish. I have fought in the Aurès Mountains in North Africa and won the Colonial Medal, on the Red River in Indochina and won the Star for bravery. I am a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. And today, after twenty-four years in uniform, I have been singled out for commendation by both the Minister of War and the Chief of the General Staff. As I lie in my mother’s spare bedroom in Versailles, and the fifth of January 1895 turns into the sixth, the voice in my head is not that of Alfred Dreyfus proclaiming his innocence, but Auguste Mercier’s hinting at my promotion : I have been impressed by the intelligence you have shown … It will not be forgotten …

The following morning, to the sound of bells , I take my mother’s fragile arm and escort her to the top of the icy road and around the corner to the cathedral of Saint-Louis—a particularly bombastic monument to state superstition, I always think; why couldn’t the Germans have blown up this? The worshippers are a monochrome congregation, black and white, nuns and widows. I withdraw my arm from hers at the door."
B00EBRU05I1,B00EBRU05I,"(Another sister died before I was born, a brother when he was eleven days old; there is one thing to be said for senility—since her mind has gone, she does not lack for company.)

The bread and milk are frozen solid; the pipes are canisters of ice. I spend the first half-hour lighting fires to try to thaw the place out, the second on my back fixing a leak. We eat boeuf bourguignon, which the maid who comes in once a day has bought at the local traiteur. Maman rallies; she even seems to remember who I am. I tell her what I’ve been doing but I don’t mention Dreyfus or the degradation: she would struggle to understand what I am talking about. Later we sit at the piano, which occupies most of her tiny sitting room, and play a duet, the Chopin rondo. Her playing is faultless; the musical part of her brain remains quite intact; it will be the last thing to go. After she has put herself to bed, I sit on the stool and examine the photographs on top of the piano: the solemn family groups in Strasbourg, the garden of the house in Geudertheim, a miniature of my mother as a music student, a picnic in the woods of Neudorf—artefacts from a vanished world, the Atlantis we lost in the war. *"
B01N7B94IK0,B01N7B94IK,"No one was rich, no one was poor and the world maintained its stability by allowing the same few hundred pounds to pass back and forth from business to business, from farm to grocery store and from wage packet to public house on a regular basis. Here, though, she could see toffs in dark pinstriped suits sporting carefully constructed mustaches, ladies in their finery, dockers and boatmen, shop girls and railway workers. A barrister walked by on his way to the Four Courts in full regalia, his black poplin gown inflating in the air behind him like a cape, his white bobbed wig threatening to blow off in the breeze. From the opposite direction, a pair of young seminarians, weaving on the pavement with drink, were followed quickly by a small boy with a coal-blackened face and a man dressed as a woman, which was a creature she had never seen before. Oh, for a camera! she thought. That’d soften their cough in West Cork! As they came to the crossroads, she turned to look down the length of O’Connell Street and saw the tall Doric column that stood halfway along with the statue standing proudly on the plinth, its nose in the air so it didn’t have to inhale the stink of the people it lorded over."
B01N7B94IK1,B01N7B94IK,"She didn’t consider any back-room terminations, even though there was gossip among some of the girls in the village regarding a widow-woman in Tralee who did terrible things with Epsom salts, rubber vacuum bags and a pair of forceps. For six shillings, they said, you could be in and out of her house in a couple of hours, three or four pounds the lighter. No, she knew exactly what she was going to do when I was born. She simply had to wait until I arrived in order to put her Great Plan into place.

 The bus to Dublin was busy and at the first stop a young man climbed on board carrying an old brown suitcase and glanced around at the few remaining empty seats. As he paused next to my mother for a moment, she could feel his eyes burning into her but didn’t dare turn to look at him in case he was someone familiar with her family who had already heard the news of her shame and would only need to see her face to make some cutting remark. Nothing was said, though, and after a moment he walked on. Only when the bus had traveled another five miles along the road did he make his way back to where she was sitting and point at the empty place beside her."
B00TUGPAZU0,B00TUGPAZU,"Peter crept up cautiously to Eva, reached out his hand, and pulled her up. He had missed his chance to save her, and he saw in her eyes that she knew it.

CHAPTER 3

TIMES HAVE CHANGED

(November 1938)

 Eva lived several blocks from Peter in a well-kept house with a manicured yard. Olga’s family rented the tiny house next door. Later that day, Olga peeked out of her modest bedroom. Her breath misted the window as she watched the white lace curtains being closed in Eva’s bedroom across the yard. She absently dragged her finger against the pane of glass, bowed her head, and disappeared from the window, leaving the outline of an X over Eva’s house on the windowpane.

  Dr. Jacob Levy stood beside Eva’s lacy bed. Though her head was bandaged with gauze, she was awake.

  Eva’s mother Helga wore a dark drab dress despite the fact that she was a seamstress.  With her hair severely pulled back in a bun, she watched them from across the room, her arms crossed against her heavy chest. Eva’s father Bert, a well-dressed, slightly pudgy man , sat on the bed and patted Eva’s hand.

  Peter stood in the doorway and peered in tentatively. Bert motioned to him."
B00TUGPAZU1,B00TUGPAZU,"Wolfgang sauntered down the hall with his self-satisfied swagger, never looking back.  Kurt, his ruffian shadow, ran after him.

  Peter knew that Wolfgang had been born into a family of hate. Wolfgang’s father, Wilbur, had been fired from his button factory job for stealing tools. He had blamed his years of making small buttons with the machines for his arthritic hands and had felt entitled to supplement his income with the factory’s tools. His family had lost their home and had to move in with Wolfgang’s grandparents. Wolfgang’s father hadn’t been able to find another job, because nobody wanted to hire a tool thief with gnarled hands. He had started drinking, and soon he had no hope left. The factory owner who had fired him had been Jewish. Wolfgang’s father’s hatred of Jews had grown from his own thievery, misplaced blame, and painful arthritis. He had eagerly passed that hate on to his son.

  In the school hall, Peter pulled his violin to him in a protective hug, breathing heavily, still curled up on the floor.

  The classroom doors flew open, and children stampeded down the hall, somehow avoiding the small boy curled around his violin like a musical cocoon."
B00BC3TSSE0,B00BC3TSSE,"While Dorothy was growing up, he ensured that his dead wife’s name was never, ever mentioned, and, as far as Dorothy was aware, there were no known photographs of her in existence. He had resisted all efforts from his wife’s family to maintain contact with the child and eventually, after several thwarted attempts, they gave up. He sent Dorothy away at the age of five to be educated at an exclusive girls’ boarding school; despite spending twelve years there, she made no real friends. Occasionally, a kind teacher would try to break through her, forbidding coldness and self-containment, but never with any success.

Dorothy excelled at her studies and graduated first in her class. She went on to Radcliffe and again excelled academically but did not engage socially. Neither her father nor anyone else turned up for her graduation ceremony four years later. When he died in Florida a few years ago, just months into his retirement, she sent a cheque to cover the cost of the cremation expenses but did not attend his funeral service. Dorothy remembered the look of surprise on Juliet’s face when she recounted this particular detail, but what Juliet, and others, failed to understand was that Dorothy’s father simply disliked fuss of any kind. So, what purpose would have been served by a showy funeral?"
B00BC3TSSE1,B00BC3TSSE,"Maybe if they’d had children, she thought, things wouldn’t seem quite so hard, so pointless.

Dorothy Crane sighed heavily as Conor joked about the prolific love life of some long-dead chieftain. Honestly, did the man think she had paid good money for some kind of stand-up comedy routine? The rest of the group were laughing like drains, which showed just how inane they were. She glanced at Juliet, who seemed lost in thought. Mooning about the departed Larry again, for God’s sake. She would speak to Juliet later; tell her that it wasn’t fair to keep going on about him as if he were some kind of saint. Dorothy could barely remember the man, other than as a kind of do-gooder type, always collecting for some charity or other. She was glad she had never married. She never understood people’s need to have others stuck in their business.

Dorothy’s father, a pathologist, had died the previous year, but you didn’t see her moping around the place like it was the end of the world, did you? A severe man who did not believe in showing affection to anyone, including his only child, he had been widowed at an early age, when Dorothy was not yet four years old."
B00ECE9OD40,B00ECE9OD4,"I had spent an entire life praying for a miracle, and none had come. And now I looked at the stuffy chapel of my ancestors and saw vanity and greed, heard the call to prayer and thought of power, smelled incense and wondered at the waste of it all.

In my fourth life I turned away from God and sought out science for an explanation. I studied as no man has studied before – physics, biology, philosophy – and at the last fought with every tool at my disposal to become the poorest boy in Edinburgh university, graduating top of my class as a doctor. Jenny was drawn to my ambition, and I to hers, for the ignorant had snickered the first time she took up a scalpel, until they saw the precision of her cuts and the confidence with which she wielded a blade. We’d been together for ten years in unfashionable but politically pointed sin, before marrying in 1963 in that swell of relief that followed the Cuban Missile Crisis; and it had rained, and she had laughed and said we both deserved it, and I had been in love.

So in love that one night, for no very special reason, and without much very special thought, I told her everything."
B00ECE9OD41,B00ECE9OD4,"She was a surgeon, one of the first female surgeons on the ward; I was a neurologist with a reputation for unorthodox and occasionally unethical – though legal – research. She believed in God. I did not. Much must be said of my third life, but for now let me say simply that my third death, alone in a hospital in Japan, had convinced me of the truth of nothingness. I had lived and I had died, and not Allah, Jehovah, Krishna, Buddha, nor the spirits of my ancestors had descended to take away my fear, but rather I had been born again exactly where I had begun, back in the snow, back in England, back in the past where it had all begun.

My loss of faith was not revelatory, nor intensely distressing. It was a prolonged growth of resignation, one which the events of my life had only reinforced, until I was forced to conclude that any conversations I had with a deity were entirely one way. My death and subsequent rebirth back where I had begun rounded the argument off with a sort of weary inevitability, and I viewed it with all the disappointment and detachment of a scientist whose test tubes had failed to precipitate."
B074DYDX8V0,B074DYDX8V,"She turned by reflex because he was so loud, so cute, and running too fast.

Then she stared. Frowned.

The aisle was empty.

Rain leaned out and craned her head to see where the kid went. He looked familiar, with brown hair and eyes and rosy cheeks. She’d seen all that in a flash through the one slice of tilted lens in the borrowed glasses. The kid was quick. He ran by and then must have ducked down somewhere out of sight.

But as she looked, she felt her smile beginning to falter. Where had the kid gone? No one seemed to be looking down or over their shoulders. And no one else had reacted to the scream of laughter, even though it had been as loud and piercing as a seagull’s cry.

Which is when Rain’s mind replayed the sound.

It was a sharp scream, no doubt. But was it a shriek of laughter? Was that really what she’d heard? The more it echoed through her head, and the more the aisle remained stubbornly empty, the more that cry sounded like something else.

It sounded like a scream.

Rain took off the glasses and turned to the old woman."
B074DYDX8V1,B074DYDX8V,"Rain nodded as if she understood, then bent to study her notes. The train rumbled along, and the old woman turned away, seemingly content to study her own reflection in the dirty glass. Rain read through the papers. The thin crack in the left lens was a minor distraction, with the sliver creating a tiny distortion. Not too bad, though, if she concentrated mostly on her right eye.

Rain went through the job requirements and some notes she’d printed out about recent changes in the New York State tax codes. It was dense stuff, but she was able to navigate it. Last night she’d downloaded several copies of a blank tax form and practiced filling them out, inputting different income and deduction amounts. Those papers were in the folder, and she went through point by point to check her math. Although she was a high school dropout, Rain had taken and aced her GED and had snuck into some accounting classes at NYU. This was something she could do and do well, if she could only catch a break and get the job.

A scream jolted her out of her thoughts, and she caught a glimpse of a little boy go pelting up the aisle, shrieking with laughter."
B000FCKDKU0,B000FCKDKU,"Faint yells across the gap between ship and wharf and the hiss-clank of autograpples firing home into their shoreside sockets. There was a sudden tilting calm to the whole scene, some unusually peaceful moment drifting up from memories of my Newpest childhood. My earlier dread evaporated, and I felt a bemused smile creep out across my face.

Get a grip, Tak. It’s just the chemicals.

Across the wharf, under a stilled robot crane, stray light glinted off her hair as she turned. I checked once more over my shoulder for signs of pursuit, but the entrance to the bar was firmly closed. Faint noises leaked through at the lower limits of my cheap synth hearing. Could have been laughter, weeping, pretty much anything. H-grenades are harmless enough long-term, but while they last you do tend to lose interest in rational thought or action. I doubted anyone’d work out where the door was for the next half hour, let alone how to get through it.

The sweeper bumped up to the wharf, cranked tight by the autograpple cables. Figures leapt ashore, trading banter. I crossed unnoticed to the shadow of the crane. Her face floated ghost-like in the gloom. Pale, wolfish beauty. The hair that framed it seemed to crackle with half-seen energies."
B000FCKDKU1,B000FCKDKU,"The Tebbit knife bioware is encoded in the runnel, half a centimeter off the edge of the blade. Cut yourself accidentally, you probably don’t go deep enough to touch it.

I slashed his face open and left.

Deep enough.

• • •

Outside, a stream of tiny iridescent skull-headed moths floated down out of the night and circled my head, leering. I blinked them away and drew a couple of hard, deep breaths. Pump that shit through. Bearings.

The wharfway that ran behind the hosing station was deserted in both directions. No sign of Plex. No sign of anyone. The emptiness seemed pregnant, trembling with nightmarish potential. I fully expected to see a huge pair of reptilian claws slit through the seams at the bottom of the building and lever it bodily out of the way.

Well, don’t, Tak. You expect it in this state, it’s going to fucking happen.

The paving . . .

Move. Breathe. Get out of here.

A fine rain had started to sift down from the overcast sky, filling up the glow of the Angier lamps like soft interference. Over the flat roof of the hosing station, the upper decks of a sweeper’s superstructure slid toward me, jeweled with navigation lights."
B07BPNQNVF0,B07BPNQNVF,"With her touch on his skin, her body hummed with lust. It radiated from her like perfume, infecting him, consuming him, controlling him. She stared deep into his eyes, waiting to see what he would do or say, but he merely watched her in stunned silence, enraptured by her power. For a while, neither of them moved. Slowly, almost hesitantly, his eyes began to snake down her torso, hovering on her breasts, and it seemed as though he would rip off her clothes at any moment, take her on the grass under the wide open sky.

She grinned. That sounded fun. Briefly, she wondered what it would be like to have sex with one of her men while he was ensnared like this, absorbed in her magic and lost in his primal nature, with their permission ahead of time, of course.

With a kiss on his forehead, she released Flynn. He blinked away the lustful haze and returned to her, his strong and powerful self once more. Without warning, he pulled her into a deep kiss, his hands cradling the back of her head as she explored his mouth, blisters of need and longing burning through her with every brush of his lips against hers."
B07BPNQNVF1,B07BPNQNVF,"The more she practiced, the less she needed the blazing fury that had sparked her connection to Damara’s magic back in their battle with the kings. Now, she simply looked inward, tapped into the swirling energy in her core, the magic she could touch and feel easier and easier the longer she spent with Damara.

She and Damara were connected, now and forever. They would always protect each other, do everything in their power to keep this connection alive for as long as they could. They were one, and no one would ever take Tina’s goddess from her.

Seconds later, she opened her eyes to find her skin glowing white. As she had back in the throne room, her feet lifted gently off the grass, the blades tickling her bare feet as she hovered. Tina smiled, leaning back into the power, letting it hold her midair as she all but orgasmed from the sheer immensity of her magic.

Dear god, all this power. It was beautiful, and it was hers.

As she rose, her eyes quickly met Flynn’s. She lifted gently until their faces were at the same height, which, considering his massive frame, left her a good two feet off the ground. She smiled warmly, and he followed suit."
B0081R0LM60,B0081R0LM6,"That wasn’t the kind of person he was at all. But then neither was he the kind of person who has a Blur poster (now under the bed), or a Salvador Dali poster (wrapped around the Blur poster), or any of a dozen other posters (wrapped around the Salvador Dali poster). He certainly wasn’t the sort of person who owns any ridiculous soft-core pornographic magazines, and yet there were three of those under the bed as well.

Most rooms have a certain feel to them, perhaps reflecting the constellation of emotions experienced there over the years, or perhaps – equally plausibly – not. For Jonathon the room had a desperate feel, accentuated alternately by its posters and by its lack of posters. He had just had his first apparently successful social encounter in London and already his excitement about it was beginning to falter, as though it was being set upon and beaten by his walls.

Every other aspect of the room reinforced this psychological assault. It was small, with a sloping ceiling which made Jonathon stoop and a rudimentary sink that made him sick. A large wardrobe slouched near the door, the grubby orange carpet shrinking away from it as if in fear."
B0081R0LM61,B0081R0LM6,"He’d had a good snoop around, felt her neck, put out the pan fire. If he hadn’t been there the pan would have continued to burn and the house could have caught fire. Was there such a thing as inverse arson?

He needed to get a hold on himself. His mind was all over the place, and he wasn’t thinking clearly. Where was his cool, now that he needed it? He ought to call the police right now, he thought. No. What he needed to do was relax and get his head together before thinking about anything else. He took a deep breath, checked his reflection in a metal tray leaning against the fridge, and then sat down on one of the stools. He took a sip of sherry, made a face because he didn’t like sherry, and opened the Manila file.

Chapter Ten

Jonathon emptied the laundry bag onto his bed, carefully filed the washing powder on his bookshelf between Valhalla Rising and Xenocide, and looked down at his table. On it was an untidy sprawl of papers, spattered with an untidy sprawl of writing. There was an article-writing competition in a local newspaper, and Jonathon had decided to enter it and make his name in journalism.

He sighed."
B07BR6B2680,B07BR6B268,"Monica sat at a table in the corner with her family: Troy, Pat, the kids, and her mother. Her mother. Everyone else in the room might as well have been invisible to Monica, because she couldn’t stop gawking at the woman.

Monica barely remembered Lily’s burial service. When Troy had introduced Monica to her mother, she had passed out, apparently for a couple of minutes. Waking up to find her mother gently patting her hand and smiling at her had almost knocked her out again.

Everything since then had passed in a blur.

Her mother had waited behind at the church while Monica and her family had gone to the burial site; she claimed to abhor cemeteries and couldn’t bear to set foot on those grounds. Far from being upset, Monica had been terrified that her mother would be gone when they returned for the repast.

But she was still there.

I’m finally talking to my mother.

Monica and her mother looked so much alike that it gave Monica chills. If Monica had been granted a vision of herself, twenty or so years in the future, that vision would have appeared exactly like the woman sitting next to her. Their genetic bond was unmistakable, downright jarring to witness."
B07BR6B2681,B07BR6B268,"The two women were speaking, both of them clearly excited.

Troy decided to hang back for a few minutes, and give them some privacy. It wasn’t every day that you met your mother for the very first time. They would have a lot to talk about, a lot of catching up to do. He wanted to let the moment last a little while longer.

4

An hour and a half later, after the burial at nearby Ben Hill Cemetery, they had returned to the church for the repast.

Everyone gathered in the spacious activity room in the basement that doubled as a dining hall. A couple of long serving tables had been set up, holding several silver chafing dishes full of food kept warm by low flames: fried chicken wings, baked tilapia, green beans, macaroni-and-cheese, meatballs, rice, collard greens, and more. Several dozen people sat at the circular tables spaced throughout the room, working through their meals and sipping cups of iced tea and soda. Laughter and smiles were everywhere. The repast was akin to a family reunion, an opportunity to break bread with friends and relatives who often saw one another only at the funeral of a loved one who had passed on."
B079D1NWN40,B079D1NWN4,"Finally when he was sure his cock would burst, he sat her up. Nina, however, had had enough. She quickly reversed the tables on him, and before he knew it, she had twined her legs behind his back securely, and she pushed herself on his cock.

Kevin froze, and she uttered a cry as she came immediately.

Regaining his senses, the shifter pulled back, and then lowering them both to the ground, he let loose, using all his pent-up frustration.

He pounded into her, making her scream. His movements didn’t stop as his hands dug into the ground for fear of leaving marks on her skin. The way her muscles tightened on his cock made him let out a rough version of her name as she milked him for all he was worth.

He was sure he blacked out there for a few seconds, and when he opened his eyes, Nina looked dazed, her hair sticking up, and her cheeks red with pleasure.

She snuggled into him, and he wrapped his arms around her, planting a kiss on her forehead. Her smile was contented, and her body relaxed.

After a few moments of companionable silence, she wiggled her head under his arm and looked up at him."
B079D1NWN41,B079D1NWN4,"He had never kissed her like this, and she could feel herself growing wetter and wetter as his tongue played with hers and his fingers swept underneath her shirt to twist her protruding nipples with the skill of a man who knew exactly what movements rendered each reaction.

Nina was like putty in his hands, and the witch tried to touch him to fulfill the craving she had to run her hands over him and give him the same pleasure. However, Kevin was having none of it. He twisted her around until she lay on the ground, and he hovered over her.

Grabbing both her wrists, he dragged them over her head and imprisoned them there with one hand. Once she was sufficiently helpless against him, he moved in. His mouth pressed wet, open-mouthed kisses on her neck. One hand ripped off her blouse, and he suckled one nipple in his hot mouth and looked up when Nina gave out small cries. She moved restlessly, trying to free herself of his grip. However, Kevin was a shifter who was undisputedly stronger than she was.

When she glared at him, he chuckled and pressed a kiss on her belly button, making her squirm."
B0092EE3K80,B0092EE3K8,"Soon enough the room was full of people; women in fashionably short long-waisted gowns, jeweled bands about their bobbed or marcelled hair, elbow-length white gloves; men in black tie and tails, some with brilliant sashes gleaming with diplomatic medals across their chests. Several of my cousins had also traveled down, keen to see their uncle the ambassador. This grand affair had no relation to the intimate Christmas Eves of my childhood, when we would go to church, then come home and sit in Mother and Daddy’s bedroom, listening as she read from the gospel of Luke, before praying silently while the snow fell, like a benediction, outside.

Now musicians were playing snippets of Bach and, in honor of the season, Handel. I floated along the edges of the crowd, content to watch; no one really knew me, so as long as I stayed away from the receiving line, I was spared having to be introduced to all these strangers.

But none of them had eyes for anyone in the room except for our guest of honor; Colonel Lindbergh was the star on top of the Christmas tree. No, he was the Christmas tree. There was an actual fir tree stuck in a corner, lit up brilliantly, decorated all in gold—but no one paid any attention to it."
B0092EE3K81,B0092EE3K8,"With grace and confidence, he explained the differences in a long monologue that left no room for interruption; his somewhat reedy voice smoothed into a rhythm not unlike, I imagined, the purr of an airplane engine. He leaned forward, his blue eyes glistening, his fingers finally at rest, as he expounded on the differences and advantages of one set of wings (the monoplane) versus two (the biplane).

As none of us, naturally, could contribute anything to this subject, small talk resumed—tossed out easily by Elisabeth and my mother, while Daddy beamed and Dwight devoured enormous quantities of sandwiches. Con even dared to tease the colonel now and then, and he didn’t seem to mind. Meanwhile, I studied my surroundings, achingly homesick for Englewood. Nothing in this cavernous hall was familiar to me, save for the tattered American flag draped over the gilt fireplace mantel: the flag my grandfather had carried, as a drummer boy, in the Civil War. There weren’t even any framed family photographs, like there were on every surface back home. Yet I was curious about the embassy, in the way that one is curious about a museum; I promised myself I’d go exploring later, after everyone else was in bed."
B074H6T1VZ0,B074H6T1VZ,"And she was almost as devoted to me as she was to Chase Covington. Because she hadn’t been kidding about the loving-him thing. She bought teen magazines by the truckload and cut out every article and picture of him. It was a very serious process deciding whether a picture should be put up on her wall or into her scrapbook. We spent hours discussing the merits of each photo and where it should go. Somewhere along the line it had gone from being Lexi’s obsession to a shared one.

Even now in our bedroom, she still had Chase Covington posters hanging on her side of the room, and she blew them kisses before she went to bed for the night. After we’d graduated from high school, Lexi had wanted to head immediately for Los Angeles and start auditioning. But her grandmother had made her a deal—if she went to college and graduated, her grandma would fund Lexi’s acting ambitions for two years.

She agreed, but the delay had frustrated her. Lexi was determined to find Chase Covington and make him fall in love with her. I didn’t doubt her ability to do it—with her half-Italian heritage, dark hair, dark eyes, and flawless skin, she was never without male company."
B074H6T1VZ1,B074H6T1VZ,"I restarted it, and my phone dinged repeatedly with notifications. I couldn’t help myself— I checked to see if Chase had said anything else. With a frown of disappointment, I realized he hadn’t, what with the ball being in my court and all.

As I wondered whether I should send him a list of what I thought was his best work, I realized my best friend and roommate, Lexi, had texted me like thirty times, and the texts were all variations of

She was a theater major and, as such, was often prone to dramatics, but this was over the top, even for her. Nearly home, I decided to hold off until I saw her in person. In part because I wasn’t sure what to tell her about Chase Covington.

Lexi was the reason I’d become a Chaser. I was homeschooled by my formerly Amish (not kidding) grandparents until my mother married, had a bunch of kids, and decided she wanted to be my parent again. The first thing she did was enroll me in public school, and at twelve years old I had absolutely no idea how to make friends.

It was Lexi who had come to my rescue."
B007WKEMW80,B007WKEMW8,"Does he not care, or does he think she is more experienced than she is? What Jimmy Doyle had to tell was damaging but not devastating, but he would not be the first boy to embellish the facts. Claude would not, but Jimmy Doyle had not been Claude, not by a long shot.

Before he comes to pick her up, she takes an old towel and stuffs it in her handbag. It sits at her feet all through the movie, giving off a glow in the darkened theater. She glances around at the audience. Their faces, lit by the reflected light from the screen, hang in the blackness like a galaxy of pale moons. Their mouths open into small holes of laughter. Their eyes, as they follow the action, careen like the steel globes in a pinball machine. They are watching the movie as if nothing is about to happen. Their obliviousness shocks her. How can they be going about their lives as if this is an ordinary night, when she is about to take such a momentous step? Don’t they know? Can’t they see it on her face and Claude ’s? Don’t the two of them give off some animal sound or scent?"
B007WKEMW81,B007WKEMW8,"He has taken off her blouse and then her bra, and she has opened his shirt, and this time when he reaches under her skirt, she does not push away his hand but hikes the fabric up for him. He slides his fingers beneath her girdle and under her panties. She holds her breath for what comes next. A few weeks before Grace’s wedding, Mrs. Painter gave Grace a book. Grace and Babe and Millie spent nights poring over it, trying to keep their giggles from seeping under the closed bedroom door, but unfortunately it was not very specific.

His fingers creep inside her. She gasps. The stealth entry becomes more confident. The book said nothing about this. Jimmy Doyle never tried this. But then, Jimmy was not as smart as Claude. She buries her face in his shoulder to keep from crying out, though no one is around to hear her.

With his free hand, he reaches for his wallet. He took it out of the buttoned pocket of his army jacket and put it on the dashboard before he even slipped off his glasses. Now he picks it up and begins fumbling with it. His breathing saws the darkness."
B0793MV68L0,B0793MV68L,"Naomi would absolutely love it, and Paige would be impressed as well.

The houses on each side were close enough that it would be a problem if the neighbors liked to blast loud music late at night, and it wasn't as if Boyd could walk around his backyard naked—not that he would— but this home had an amazing amount of privacy.

And there was a koi pond. A frickin' koi pond! There were no fish in it at the moment, but Boyd could never have imagined that a home with a koi pond in the backyard would be within their price range. The upper end of their price range, yet still...

He was getting too excited. He hadn't even seen the inside of the house yet. There might be snakes slithering through holes in the walls.

He wandered around the outside of the house, looking for defects, until he heard a car pull into the driveway. Three o'clock. The landlord was exactly on time for their walkthrough. Boyd hurried to the front yard to greet him.

The landlord was a short man with a thin mustache and hair that stuck up in the back. He was dressed in slacks and a white dress shirt with heavy sweat stains on the sides."
B0793MV68L1,B0793MV68L,"By Thursday evening, he was starting to get discouraged, though he didn't confess this to Adeline. At least the training was going well. The class focused more on a corporate environment than what Boyd would be working in, but he was picking up some helpful tips and was confident in his ability to effectively boss people around.

Class ended early on Friday. He received a certificate suitable for framing. If the search for a place to live went on past today, he'd be responsible for his own hotel costs, and he was anxious to get back to Adeline and the girls, so hopefully this would be the day.

When he looked at the first place on that day's list, he had a good feeling.

CHAPTER THREE

It definitely wasn't perfect. Much of the light blue paint on the outside was peeling, and there were anthills all over the yard. But what a yard. Boyd would've been okay with a home where you could open your window and hand your neighbor a cup of coffee through their window, but this place had a fenced-in yard the size of the swimming pool at the YMCA. He could imagine having dozens of friends over for a barbecue."
B077SCNYNS0,B077SCNYNS,"Today I learned: Just because a girl is pretty doesn’t mean you should let her inside your head.

When the pain finally subsided, I slumped to the floor, completely spent.

I can’t speak to you like this easily when you stray from the temple, Nola said. But when you are near, I’ll try to give you clever ideas that will help you do your job. For instance, did you know that if you get a health potion and freeze it, it will make a rejuvenating ice pop during the hot summer months? I’m full of tips like that. Nola, holy deliverer of life hacks.

My breathing was still heavy from the ordeal I went through.

Well, go ahead. Try out your new skill!

I thought about my skills. Instantly, a menu opened before my eyes, one that only I could see. I was mesmerized by the soft blue light that shone in the form of words and numbers. Finally, I was seeing what the world’s few skillmeisters had seen. What Cahn had seen. I had joined an elite class, reserved for the few who could see what a person’s life experiences amounted to, and decide whether to use those experiences to make them stronger, and in which ways."
B077SCNYNS1,B077SCNYNS,"I tossed the lifeless bodies of the ants to the side. My shirt was salvageable. My pants held up, though they had holes in the knees now. Not fashionable at all.

I turned toward the cocoon, lying on the ground and containing a woman with her arms crossed on her chest. The transparent material encasing her clouded when it got toward her waist. The only window was on the upper half of her body.

Kneeling beside this curious find, I stared at the woman within. She practically radiated with soft yellow light. Her lips were full, her eyelashes long. A heart-shaped face tapered to a point at her chin.

Then her eyes opened and I fell backward. The blood rushed to my face. I had been caught staring.

Not cool, Arden!, I thought.

The woman inside that crystal sarcophagus pressed against the upper edge of it and sat up. Her body moved through that barrier as if it were nothing. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe I was imagining all of this.

She looked over at me and lowered her arms. Her breasts were bare. She didn’t bother to pull her long brown hair forward to hide them. I cast my eyes to the side."
B079D8WXT20,B079D8WXT2,"Past the fenced-in backyard where the half-built shed is on one side of the yard and a small covered patio with a fireplace is on the other. There are acres and acres of fields with grapevines growing. Their rows line the hills and their stakes make an optical illusion I stare at for some time, lost until the parachutes in the far distance near where I saw the airport on my drive into town catch my attention. Then I notice the space. Wide-open space without high-rises, or neighbors nearby, or the constant sounds of the city.

It’s beautiful. It’s foreign.

I stare as the tears burn my eyes and the emotions I continue to bury try to fight their way to the surface.

I’m so lost in my thoughts that I yelp when something wet and warm hits the back of my leg.

What the hell?

When I whip around, I’m met with the ugliest, cutest thing I have ever seen. All fifty-or-so pounds of her.

The pig is whitish-pink with black spots. She has a fine layer of wiry hair coating her skin, and her pink snout is wet and quivering as she sniffs the air.

I know what I’m seeing, but it actually takes me a few seconds to really believe that I’m standing in Grady’s kitchen having a staring contest with a pig."
B079D8WXT21,B079D8WXT2,"And I know he’s finally home.

Crap.

This isn’t how I planned on meeting him, but what am I going to do? Hide away in this bedroom and pretend I’m not here when my car is clearly parked on the left side of the driveway?

I scramble out of bed and throw on a robe, pull the sash on it as tight as it can go, and prepare myself to meet my new housemate. Of sorts.

There’s another giggle. A murmured sound of satisfaction. Both make me cringe to open my bedroom door.

But I do. Curiosity gets the best of me.

I’m blinded momentarily as the sun from the open front door reflects off one very sexy, slinky, and daring silver sparkly dress. A pair of sky-high strappy heels is in one of her hands. Her other is threaded through the hair at the base of the neck of the man whose back is to me.

I shouldn’t stare, but I do.

And not because I’m being rude but because of the immediate sense of inadequacy I feel when I look at her. My frumpy robe admittedly makes me feel out of place next to her in her party dress."
B00A9ET4MC0,B00A9ET4MC,"Obinze looked at the tan colonnaded house. Inside was his furniture imported from Italy, his wife, his two-year-old daughter, Buchi, the nanny Christiana, his wife’s sister Chioma, who was on a forced holiday because university lecturers were on strike yet again, and the new housegirl, Marie, who had been brought from Benin Republic after his wife decided that Nigerian housegirls were unsuitable. The rooms would all be cool, air-conditioner vents swaying quietly, and the kitchen would be fragrant with curry and thyme, and CNN would be on downstairs, while the television upstairs would be turned to Cartoon Network, and pervading it all would be the undisturbed air of well-being. He climbed out of the car. His gait was stiff, his legs difficult to lift. He had begun, in the past months, to feel bloated from all he had acquired— the family, the houses, the cars, the bank accounts—and would, from time to time, be overcome by the urge to prick everything with a pin, to deflate it all, to be free. He was no longer sure, he had in fact never been sure, whether he liked his life because he really did or whether he liked it because he was supposed to."
B00A9ET4MC1,B00A9ET4MC,", he was sitting in the back of his Range Rover in still Lagos traffic, his jacket slung over the front seat, a rusty-haired child beggar glued outside his window, a hawker pressing colorful CDs against the other window, the radio turned on low to the Pidgin English news on Wazobia FM, and the gray gloom of imminent rain all around. He stared at his BlackBerry, his body suddenly rigid. First, he skimmed the e-mail, instinctively wishing it were longer. Ceiling, kedu? Hope all is well with work and family. Ranyinudo said she ran into you some time ago and that you now have a child! Proud Papa. Congratulations. I recently decided to move back to Nigeria. Should be in Lagos in a week. Would love to keep in touch. Take care. Ifemelu.

He read it again slowly and felt the urge to smooth something, his trousers, his shaved-bald head. She had called him Ceiling. In the last e-mail from her, sent just before he got married, she had called him Obinze, apologized for her silence over the years, wished him happiness in sunny sentences, and mentioned the black American she was living with. A gracious e-mail. He had hated it."
B01LY2BN5I0,B01LY2BN5I,"Down the long road he drove, it was isolated out here, a thing he and Shirley had discussed over the years, isolation not being a good thing for the kids. There were cornfields on one side and soybean fields on the other. The single tree—huge—that had been in the middle of the cornfields had been struck by lightning a few years back, and it lay now on its side, the long branches bare and broken and poking up toward the sky.

The truck was there next to the small house, which had not been painted in so many years it looked washed out, the shingles pale, some missing. The blinds were drawn, as they always were, and Tommy got out of his car and went and knocked on the door. Standing in the sunshine, he thought again of Lucy Barton, how she had been a skinny child, painfully so, and her hair was long and blond, and almost never did she look him in the eye. Once, when she was still so young, he had walked into a classroom after school and found her sitting there reading, and she had jumped— he saw her really jump with fear —when the door opened."
B01LY2BN5I1,B01LY2BN5I,"Not long before his brother died, he told Tommy about what he had seen in the camps, and how he and the others had the job of taking the townspeople through them. They had somehow taken a group of women from the town through the camps to show them what had been right there, and Tommy’s brother said that although some of the women wept, some of them put their chins up, and looked angry, as if they refused to be made to feel bad. This image had always stayed with Tommy, and he wondered why it came to him now. He unrolled the window all the way down. It seemed the older he grew — and he had grown old — the more he understood that he could not understand this confusing contest between good and evil, and that maybe people were not meant to understand things here on earth.

 But as he approached the sign that declared SEWING AND ALTERATIONS, he slowed his car and turned down the long road that led to the Barton house. Tommy had made a practice of checking in on Pete Barton, who of course was not a kid now but an older man, ever since Ken— Pete’s father—had died. Pete had stayed living in the house alone, and Tommy had not seen him for a couple of months."
B004GKNIWM0,B004GKNIWM,"But he happened to be the grandson of one of the last Mensheviks who jumped on the bandwagon of bolshevism as it was on the fast track to power. Teachers were instructed to do everything possible to ensure Golosov received his diploma. He barely made it. Although Vladimir would gladly help his classmate write his term papers and his finals — Oleg was not a bad guy, after all—he could not observe with indifference the staggering career of this perpetual dunce. The string-pulling Oleg benefited from all of his life would propel him all the way to the top of the Central Statistical Administration, where he had the rank of a federal minister.

The degree plan at MVTU took five and a half years to complete. In the winter of 1957, Vladimir presented his work in front of a State commission and passed the comprehensive exams. By the end of February, he received his diploma of higher education with a degree in mechanical engineering (see Figure 1). He may have been a good student, but he had no patronage, nobody to pull strings for him. So he got a modest engineering job in a secret plant, the SAM plant, manufacturing calculating machines."
B004GKNIWM1,B004GKNIWM,"Years later, Volodia would remember the subservient attitude of teachers toward the children of those Communist big shots. Other kids like him, whose parents never brought gifts to teachers, were viewed as future delinquents, with a sense of morals bound to fall apart the minute they left this temple of education.

His schoolteacher could not believe that the Vetrov kid had been admitted to the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School (MVTU). This institution was probably the most prestigious engineering school in the Soviet Union, comparable to what Lomonosov University was in the humanities and research. The competitive entrance exam was draconian, and for each available opening for a student, with or without a scholarship, there were between ten to fifteen applicants. Vladimir was admitted in 1951, at a time when the country was still very enthusiastic about industrialization and the design of ever more intelligent and better performing machines. Engineers were the future, and the acronym MVTU resounded a little like MIT in the U.S.

USSR junior division champion, Vladimir was considered so technically correct that he was the reference in training other athletes.

A good student in school, a national champion, admitted to the MTVU — Volodia’s parents were always very proud of their only son."
B00W22J6TU0,B00W22J6TU,"She held up the jacket of the suit once again, and remembering Graham’s words, she slipped her hand into the inside pocket. She suddenly felt a bit foolish, but then her hand touched what appeared to be paper and her heart skipped a beat. She pulled it out and turned it over. It wasn’t a fifty-pound note, but an old, yellowing envelope.

2

Tina smoothed out the creamy envelope and regarded it curiously. She pressed it to her face and inhaled its musty smell. It was addressed to Miss C. Skinner, 33 Wood Gardens, Manchester. In the corner was an unfamiliar postage stamp, bearing not the picture of Queen Elizabeth II as expected, but that of a man Tina presumed to be King George VI. She turned the envelope over and noticed it was still firmly sealed. Looking again at the stamp, she was surprised to see there was no postmark. For some reason this letter had never been posted. To open it seemed a terrible intrusion somehow, as though she was prying into someone else’s business, and yet she couldn’t simply discard it. The bell on the shop door rang again, making her jump, and she felt her face inexplicably redden as she stuffed the envelope into her handbag and greeted her first customer of the day."
B00W22J6TU1,B00W22J6TU,"In spite of the notice on the shop door asking people not to, someone had left a sack of old clothes on the doorstep. It was inconceivable to Tina that anyone would actually steal clothes that had been donated to charity, but it had happened on several occasions. Even in these gloomy economic times of strikes and power cuts, it was still surprising how low some people would stoop. She hoisted the bag over her shoulder, unlocked the door and went inside. After two years of working here, the smell of the place still caused her to wrinkle her nose. Second-hand clothing had an odour all of its own and was the same in every charity shop or jumble sale you went to. Mothballs mixed with stale sweat and biscuits.

Tina put the kettle on for the second time that morning and opened the sack. She pulled out an old suit and held it up to give it the once-over. It was very old but incredibly well made and of a quality the likes of which she had not encountered before. It was an unusual greenish colour, with a very faint gold stripe, and made entirely of wool.

The bell rang on the shop door, causing her to halt her examination."
B00H25FCNG0,B00H25FCNG,"Teia hadn’t even noticed the clouds gathering. She took off the dark spectacles, dropped her pack at her feet, flipped her cloak around so its muted blue side was out, put the pack back on, but in the front, and pulled the cloak on over that. She pulled up the hood and joined the streams of people hurrying in the rain. It was harder to modify your gait when you were rushing. Throwing your hips around to mimic a curvier woman was easy for her at a walk, she could merely bring her steps together as if walking a rope. Doing that while half jogging as if to get out of the rain? She wasn’t that good.

She began rummaging through the pack as she walked. She hadn’t brought much she could use for disguises to wear, but she did have a bright yellow shawl and a scarf. At the next intersection, she ducked into a merchant’s stall as if using it to cut a corner into another alley. She dropped the hood, pulled out a red scarf—or maybe it was green, the squad liked to play its little jokes on each other, and knowing her problem with colors, none of them would tell her straight."
B00H25FCNG1,B00H25FCNG,"Paralyzed, indecisive, passive and hating herself for it, Teia looked down the alley. Paryl’s greatest strength was that no one could see it except a handful of people in the world. If someone else could see their murders, those assassins lost their greatest weapon.

Which made Teia a threat to their power. Teia had seen an assassination. Perhaps they feared she’d seen the assassin, too.

So, Teia, do you isolate yourself with a man you know has murdered an innocent before, and who is threatened by your very existence?

Putting the matter that way made what remained of Teia’s curiosity shrivel from a big succulent grape to a nasty little raisin. Teia hated raisins. Loved grapes. They weren’t the same thing at all, no matter what people said.

If the man had wanted to simply murder her, he could have done it already. With his paryl messages, he’d proven that he could move nearby without her noticing him. So he wanted to get her alone first. Why?

It couldn’t be for something good. The man was a murderer. If your enemy wants it, don’t let him have it.

She ran.

Teia got a few startled looks as she bolted, but she didn’t care."

Rob's Mission

Monday arrived uneventfully. The weekend was over, friends and family had left, and everything was quiet again around the house. By morning, Janet was ready for her second week of work at the Sunshine Bakery, where she had landed a job as an assistant manager. It was one of the most popular soup and sandwich shops in Cypress Creek.

She hoped to one day run her own restaurant and had several ideas of her own. She knew from experience that the food industry was difficult and risky, but she was determined to see her dreams come true. Once the house was fixed up, they could sell it for far more than they paid for it. At least that was the plan. It was hard for her to tell lately where her husband's head was.

Rob, himself, had a busy day planned. After a weekend of entertaining, he was exhausted. He had a list of odd jobs to do around the house in addition to his writing. It was October, and his December deadline was looming."
B0797KWCM31,B0797KWCM3,"The photos were of the family who had lived in the house decades before. The Saxtons, Gerald and Annette, along with their children, Spencer and Bridget, had been murdered in 1982, two days before Christmas. According to the other photos he found, Rob was their third child. He was an infant then and had survived. A birth certificate confirmed as much. His parents weren’t his real parents. The Saxtons were. If any of it were to be believed.

Rob had grown up in Cypress Creek and had never heard of the murders, even as an inquisitive child. He'd seen the Saxton House before, fascinated by its isolation and grandeur. He left Florida after high school and attended Ohio State to get a degree in English and writing. He moved to Atlanta and taught for a few years, meeting Janet through a school function. At the time, Janet managed a catering business.

They had been married for five years, and it seemed anything was possible. Purchasing the old and neglected Saxton home was considered by Rob as an investment. They'd build equity. And for the first time, they'd own property. Even with the subsequent necessary repairs, Rob wasn't supposed to be having doubts. Not this soon."
B004AYDJDM0,B004AYDJDM,"Given the sheer number of photos he’d viewed when he was an FBI agent, God only knew when he’d seen a picture that resembled the man in the drawing. Hell, there was nothing to say he’d even seen it while working at the FBI. Raissa had claimed she thought the man looked familiar, too, so for all he knew it could have been a likeness in a local newspaper.

But for some reason, that didn’t feel right.

He took another glance at the drawing and frowned. Somewhere buried in the depths of his mind was the answer. He slipped the drawing back into the folder and concentrated on the road ahead of him. As soon as he got back to his apartment, he would pull out his journals from his FBI years. Maybe something in them would spark his memory. Beyond the basics of background searching, the drawing was his best lead for now.

Unless, of course, Raissa or Sabine could call up more spirits to give them an address.

Sabine opened the tiny window in the corner of the attic of her store’s building and stuck her head out, hoping for a breeze. She coughed once, wheezed a couple more times, then pulled her head back inside and stared at Maryse, who was already tugging on boxes tucked in the far corners of the room."
B004AYDJDM1,B004AYDJDM,"And the worst part was, against his own better judgment, he’d picked up a banner and agreed to march. No doubt about it— he was going to make a colossal fool of himself over a beautiful woman who walked like a ballet dancer. Maybe he needed to reconsider his vow of bachelorhood and settle down with a nice accountant or something. Women like Sabine LeVeche could only get him into trouble.

Sabine turned before entering the shop and gave him a wave and a smile. Beau waved back and started his truck, hoping the drive back to the city would clear his head and help him make sense of the mess he’d just gotten himself into. Not one psychic but two. And he had actually agreed to embark on a search for dead people with his biggest lead supposedly coming from the dead people themselves. For a man who was more than a skeptic, it was an irony he wasn’t quite ready to fathom.

As he drove out of town and onto the highway to New Orleans, he pulled Raissa’s drawing out of the envelope and took another look. He knew he’d seen that face somewhere before, but not exactly that face and not in person. For the life of him, that’s all he could remember."
B01NCQOPFD0,B01NCQOPFD,"Only the flush on his porcelain skin reminded me that he was still flesh, blood, and heart, and not a machine programmed to ruin my life. The color in his cheeks even gave his dark, brooding features a boyish glint.

I wasn’t surprised to see the I-dare-you-to-fuck-with-me expression was still stamped on his face, like an old song I knew by heart. I also wasn’t surprised to see that, unlike me, his sense of style had matured with age. Impeccable, yet unpretentious. He wore dark-blue jeans, brown Oxfords, a white dress shirt, and a tailored blazer.

Casual. Understated. Expensive.

Nothing fancy, but enough to remind you that he was still richer than 99.9% of the population. I always changed the subject whenever my parents tried to fill me in on anyone from Todos Santos, and they never mentioned Vicious. Not in recent years, anyway. For all I knew, he woke up every day to do nothing except dress like a big-shot rich guy.

I couldn’t look in his eyes, couldn’t even look in his direction. My gaze moved to the man who sat opposite him. He was slightly older—early thirties, maybe?— heavy-set with sandy-blond hair and the sharply tailored suit of a greedy Wall Street broker."
B01NCQOPFD1,B01NCQOPFD,"The cold wind slapped my cheeks, the sting like a whip lash. I ran so fast it took me a few seconds to absorb the fact that someone had yanked me back by the courier bag slung over my shoulder. I fell flat on my ass. The ground was wet and cold, and I’d landed on my tailbone.

I didn’t care. I didn’t even have time to be shocked or get angry. I clutched my bag close to my chest and looked up at the offender. He was just a kid. A teenager, to be exact, with a face dotted with popped pimples. Tall and lanky and in all probability as hungry as I was. But it was my bag. My stuff. New York was a concrete jungle. I knew that sometimes, in order to survive, you had to be mean. Meaner than those who were mean to you.

I shoved my hand into my bag, hunting for the pepper spray. I just planned to threaten him— he had to learn a lesson. The kid yanked my bag again, and again I pulled it closer to my middle. I found the cool can of Mace and pulled it out, aiming at his eyes."
B071RX91GF0,B071RX91GF,"Soft feminine laughter drifted down the hall and Reaper almost stiffened. Almost. He cursed under his breath but managed somehow to stay disciplined enough not to move. That sounded a lot like the bartender. He had to keep his head in the game, not worry about some woman who’d probably been sent to kill Czar. Well, okay, he didn’t believe that for a moment. He’d think about her later and the fact that those three hard-asses were looking for women. Right now, the only thing in his world was replaying step-by-step in his mind how he would kill the Demons and protect his president.

Razor had to go first; Reaper would draw and shoot him in the head. Two bullets to make certain, although he didn’t miss. The president second, even though Code and Absinthe would go for him as well. Savage would take the two sitting to either side of their president, the ones assigned to protect him, just as Code was assigned to Czar. The two were named Weed and Shaft. Their cuts had their road names as well as their offices. It was unusual for a president, enforcer, secretary and road captain to all come to a meet at once. Something big was up."
B071RX91GF1,B071RX91GF,"He studied the man’s face as Absinthe took his weapons. Yeah, he was the real deal. What was he doing in a small-time club? There had to be more to the Demons than they had ferreted out. The enforcer passed over his weapons without a murmur, his eyes sweeping the room, taking in the setup, realizing he couldn’t see either Reaper or Savage clearly.

Both men had a way of blurring their image. It was useful when hunting others. They’d developed the skill over the years, starting when they were toddlers and Czar had them practicing. Most of it was learning to choose the right place to stand. The shadows covering them. The stillness one needed so the human eye wasn’t drawn in that direction.

The Demons came in one by one, just as Czar directed. Ice tailed them, closing the door behind them. Reaper made certain to watch each of them as they came through, noting which one would be the likeliest to start trouble—that would be Tether, the youngest, the one eager to prove himself. The first one, the one they called Razor, was the one Reaper determined was the most lethal. He marked him as the one to take down first."
B078TMXG670,B078TMXG67,"For just in case, Mr. Horn made sure I have lead bars and molds for casting .54 bullets. All the little tools for caring for the weapons like picks and brushes are divided between my possibles bag and a pack.

I am heading west in a rough meandering route towards the Rocky Mountains and the Yellowstone River. Mr. Horn advised me to stay clear of towns, and if needing supplies to try and trade work for what I lack, preferably at a small farm. I heed that advice, successfully steering clear of folks for over a month. I make small camps, eat, clean up, and am ready for an early start in the morning. The nights are warm so I don’t set up a tent. However, I do cover the packs with a canvass tarp. The last chore of the night is checking the powder on all my weapons. I sleep dressed, in my boots, and have my belt of weapons handy.

It is late, the moon is up, and the coals of my small fire are almost out when I hear horses approaching. After kicking off my blanket, I grab my belted weapons and both rifles before stepping back into the rocks.

Two riders slowly and carefully enter the clearing."
B078TMXG671,B078TMXG67,"After a nod to them I ride out of the yard.

On my pack horses ride three packs, two on either side and one on top. I thought I was over loaded but Mr. Horn assures me everything I am packing will prove to be handy. A coffee pot, frying pan, and boiling pot, utensils, and a Dutch oven make my camp hardware. For supplies I bring coffee beans, which I roast in the frying pan and mash into grounds with the back of my axe. Mr. Horn assured me a coffee grinder is a luxury that takes up valuable space, something I don’t need. I’ve packed beans, salt, cones of hard brown sugar, tea, and canned fruit, a comfort I will indulge in along the trail. Another comfort I will have to face doing without is flour and bread. Mr. Horn let me know the sooner I can wean myself away from bread the better off I will be. Once my supply is gone, there are few places in the mountains to resupply flour. I give up bread. For equipment, I carry a square of canvas to use as a shelter, an axe, a saw, and files for sharpening. I’ve stocked up on powder, flints, and .54 caliber balls."
B07BD45P6H0,B07BD45P6H,"I head over to my desk and get settled, but something’s nagging at me. The way people were looking at me as I entered was almost openly hostile, which makes no sense.

I try and go through the last few days. I haven’t messed anything up, or really even had any big projects. It’s been business as usual, at least as far as I’m concerned. I want to message Taylor about it, but she took the day off today too because her brother’s wife went into labor last night.

I skim my email but don’t find anything incriminating, just the usual requests and threads. I decide to try and put it out of my mind, chalking it up to my own paranoia. I dive into work, trying to forget about it.

Hours pass that way, and eventually I do forget. I’m busy, enough at least to keep my mind engaged with something else, and soon the time slips past. Toward the end of the day, I head into the break room to grab a cup of tea to keep away the end of the day crash.

I run into Stan there. He glances up at me from one of the tables and frowns."
B07BD45P6H1,B07BD45P6H,"I need to think of myself first, and maybe the baby a little bit, too. I’ll find a good family for my baby, people that can actually raise her in a good environment, unlike me. I have no money, no husband, no prospects. I can barely keep myself afloat.

I go through all the reasons to give my baby up for adoption again in my mind like a mantra before getting out of my car and heading inside. I have to stay strong for myself and for my baby. And I can’t let Elias confuse me, or at least I can’t let my desire for him confuse me anymore than I already am.

I head upstairs and into the office. Marnie’s desk is right up front, and she’s wearing this absurdly bright orange and blue blouse. She looks like the Dutch flag or something. She looks up at me with a scowl, but that’s pretty normal. I smile sweetly and say hello, but she doesn’t bother to respond.

I head further into the office, saying hello to everyone I see, but for some reason nobody responds at all. I spot Joey, but he looks away as soon as I see him, which makes me frown.

I don’t know what’s going on."
B073P9DK6B0,B073P9DK6B,"Before beginning the novel, Lily hoisted herself onto the kitchen counter and sneaked exactly ten saltines from Aunt Tate’s larder. Then, she propped herself up on her bed with the book, eating the saltines as slowly as possible. As she sucked the salt from each cracker, she knew she was just like Freckles—crippled and unlovable. Still, she felt a little less lonely.

The mysterious books smelled of time, somehow held the breath of another reader, someone before Lily. The secrecy surrounding the identity of the book-giver made Lily feel special, somehow deserving. The books also let her travel far from the relentless flatlands of her life with Uncle Miles and Aunt Tate.

Pragmatic Aunt Tate didn’t abide mysteries, but if she wondered about the books’ origins, she never said anything to Lily. Aunt Tate dealt with the tangible world, the only exceptions being Jesus, the disciples, and the New Testament miracles. As for Lily, she thought the books might be from her elementary school librarian, who’d often commented on Lily’s avaricious appetite for books about pioneer girls who were held captive by Indians, or the wildly vengeful myths of the Greeks and Romans. In a way, it didn’t matter who sent the books, as long as whoever it was kept sending them.

SHE HAD FEW memories of the night that broke her life into Before and After. She remembered that her allergies had been so severe that her nose bled, and so Mama made Lily lie down in the backseat, wrapped in a blanket patterned with stars and moons. As Lily drifted off to sleep, she watched Dawn stand, reach over the front seat, and begin to braid their mother’s hair.

Lily remembered waking up on the side of the road, curled into the arms of a stranger and seeing the Aviator standing near his car—the one with taillights set in wildly exaggerated fins that looked like some beast’s red, wicked eyes. She remembered her family’s motionless car, sparks of insects flashing in the headlight beams. Redwing blackbirds rising from fields of summer wheat, panicked by the commotion. The hiss of whitewall tires as they sighed last breaths; a violent whoosh of steam erupting from the radiator.

The Aviator had knelt beside Lily, holding a handkerchief to the top of his head. A thick shock of black hair hid his eyes. Lines of blood painted the contours of his face and ran into his mouth."
B01CO34EC00,B01CO34EC0,"She listens, raises a spoon to her mouth, and smiles at me to show how grateful she is that I am still there with her, and for making her soup that she swallows out of duty.

I know she could disappear at any moment. Where would I go then?

When my school bus drops me off outside our apartment building each afternoon, the first thing I do is pick up the mail. After that, I prepare dinner for the two of us, finish my homework, and check if there are any bills to pay, which I pass on to Mom.

Today we received a large envelope with yellow, white, and red stripes and its warning in big red capital letters: DO NOT BEND. The sender is in Canada, and it is addressed to Mom. I leave it on the dining table and lie down on my bed to begin reading the book I was given at school. A few hours later, I remember that I haven’t opened the envelope.

I start knocking on Mom’s bedroom door. At this time of night? she must be thinking. She’s pretending to be asleep. Silence. I keep knocking.

Nights are sacred for her: she tries to fall asleep, reliving things she can no longer do, and thinking about what her life might have been like if she could have avoided fate or simply wiped it away."
B01CO34EC01,B01CO34EC0,"She wakes up, attempting to find the correct piece, trying all the different combinations to create those distant landscapes of hers. I live to undo them so that I can discover where I came from. I am creating my own jigsaw puzzles out of photos I printed at home from the images I found on Dad’s camera.

From the day I discovered what had really happened to Dad, and Mom understood I could fend for myself, she shut herself in her bedroom and I became her caretaker. She converted her bedroom into her refuge, keeping the window overlooking the interior courtyard always closed. In dreams, I would see her falling fast asleep from the pills she took before going to bed, engulfed by her gray sheets and pillows. She said the pills helped ease the pain and knock her out. Sometimes I would say a prayer— so silent that even I could not hear or remember it—that she would stay asleep, and her pain would go away forever. I couldn’t bear to see her suffer.

Every day before I leave for school, I take her a cup of black coffee, with no sugar. In the evening, she sits at supper with me like a ghost while I make up stories about my classes."
B076ZF11KZ0,B076ZF11KZ,"This discoloration spread in rapid succession over the four ends, encrusting them in jagged, barnacled armor. The creature limbered its new appendages, flexing them like fingers.

The newly formed talons swooped down at Billy. He swung and missed. At once, the claw grasped his middle, knocking him back into the captain. Billy’s hands and Lura Zahn became absurdly tangled in the skeleton’s ribcage. The demon’s tongue ripped Billy from the stern castle, leaving the sword behind.

As Billy slammed down on the main deck, he saw the mouth of the demon had grown to replace the form of Caenne. The giant, clawed tongue dragged him in towards rows of sharp, curved teeth. Billy beat and kicked at the extremity, but to little effect.

In desperation, he gripped his assailant and concentrated on his mother’s ring. Putrid smoke peeled off the tongue. The demon bellowed and thrust Billy back against the wall of the stern castle. It battered him repeatedly against the boards until they broke. He collapsed, and the grotesque tongue drew his slumped body from the wreckage. He felt helpless as the monster towed him back to its waiting maw.

All of a sudden, a heavy bronze spear pinned the muscular organ to the deck. The flesh surrounding the weapon quivered and smoked."
B076ZF11KZ1,B076ZF11KZ,"It thrust up against its restraints—tearing ropes, breaking pins and bending cleats, but still the net held. The monster bellowed and a mass of flat, hooked tentacles shot through the net to wrap around the sailors and draw them in like kelp. Though it snapped and pulled their bones apart, the crew continued to stab and slash at the black monstrosity.

Just then, a fist-shaped protrusion thrust up and tore through the middle of the net. A great, blood-red eye appeared near the new summit of the beast. It focused on Drif and two of the largest tentacles encircled her legs. She cleaved off one of them, but as she raised her sword to smite the other, a third enveloped her arm and bent it back behind her. Drif yelped. Her weapon dropped to the deck like a dart.

Shaldra shot an arrow into the tentacle around Drif’s arm. It jerked in response, causing her to grunt and drop the dagger she had been drawing with her free hand. The two limbs around her then lifted and spread apart. Drif cried out as the tremendous strength of the behemoth stretched her body. Shaldra shot another arrow into the monster’s extremity.

Billy appeared next to him and pointed."
B00C2WDD5I0,B00C2WDD5I,"Jin was so entranced by the machine’s sound and light pulses, he didn’t notice the people falling around him. Something was happening. And it was happening to him too. His legs felt heavier. He heard a sound like bending metal—the machine was pulling against the cables at each side; it was trying to lift.

The pull of the floor got stronger with each passing second. Jin looked around but couldn’t see the children. Jin felt someone grab his shoulder. He turned to find a man holding on to him. His face had deep wrinkles, and blood ran from his nose. Jin realized that the skin from the man’s hands was coming off on Jin’s clothes. It wasn’t just skin. The man’s blood began to spread over Jin’s shirt. The man fell forward onto him, and they both collapsed to the ground. Jin heard the boom-boom-boom of the machine blend into one constant drone of sound and solid light as he felt blood flow from his nose down his face. Then the light and sound suddenly stopped.

In the control room, Dr. Shen Chang and his team stood and watched as the test subjects collapsed into a pile of wrinkled, bloody bodies.

Chang slumped into his chair."
B00C2WDD5I1,B00C2WDD5I,"They stopped about level with the huge machine and seemed to tighten, anchoring it at each side. Jin strained to look up. There was another cable running from the top of the machine. It was even fatter than the ones at the sides. Unlike the others, it wasn’t metal, or even solid. It seemed to hold a bundle of wires or computer cables, like some sort of electronic umbilical cord.

The children had stopped in the middle of the crowd. All the adults tried to look up.

His eyes adjusted, and Jin could just make out a marking etched into the side of the machine. It looked like the Nazi symbol, the… he couldn’t remember the name. He felt so sleepy.

The machine was dark, but Jin thought he could hear a faint throbbing sound, like someone rhythmically beating on a solid door—boom-boom-boom. Or maybe the sound of the picture machine. Was it a different picture machine? A group picture? The boom-boom-boom grew louder with each passing second, and a light emerged from the top of the giant pawn—its head apparently had short windows. The yellow-orange light flickered with each pulse of the boom, giving it almost the effect of a lighthouse."
B071G5VMVP0,B071G5VMVP,"My obsession with Grant Sanchez had never been this bad; that had been lust, nothing more. Which was why I’d never acted on it and was happy when he started dating Emerson, my teammate and now my friend.

I finally glanced up.

Our eyes locked. How long had he been staring at me?

I gulped.

He mimicked my movement, only for some reason it looked like his throat moved in slow motion. That damn throat, all smooth, muscular. Right. Like he had a reason to be nervous or even upset. He was a serial dater who’d basically told me to my face, mind you, after having sex with me twice, that I should flee the country and go to Europe for the summer!

Not the best way to make a girl feel secure. Add that to the fact that I’d gained ten pounds because Europeans ate a lot of bread, and I’d left the country with a broken heart mixed with the fury of a woman scorned. I was completely ready to throw myself off a cliff or at least put a paper bag over the pillowy half of my body that, since returning to the States, refused to drop the pounds I’d gained."
B071G5VMVP1,B071G5VMVP,"Miller.

Freaking MILLER was here?

I hadn’t seen him since Vegas.

I had actually avoided him like the plague until I left for Europe, only to find out that he’d been dating nonstop since I’d left! Not that I’d stalked him, or paid attention to social media, including gossip sites, tweets, and stupid hashtags about his biceps. Nope, not even the ones that said he was the hottest tight end with a tight end made for sin. I especially ignored those, for obvious reasons. I’d seen that tight end up close and personal— they had no idea the type of sinning a girl would do when faced with that—and his perfect lips. I shivered then mentally strangled myself until my mental self lost all consciousness.

Hold it the hell together, Kins.

I’d been able to do it for years!

I’d been constantly surrounded by football players and good-looking men with enough muscles and money to keep any irrational human occupied.

He was just like every other stupid football player I’d ever known — I mean other than my brother. At least Jax kept it in his pants and didn’t wear his arrogance on his sleeve like a Cub Scout badge."
B01ER14CRY0,B01ER14CRY,"Lady Hardcastle that he and his assistant (whose name went in one ear and out the other) were there to keep us safe. Not, he insisted hastily, that we would need it. His village was the safest in the district. If we needed anything, we had only to ask.

True to his word, he didn’t press us for a cup of tea as our friends on the London force might have. Instead, he bade us both good day and strolled back down the garden path whistling a music hall song.

Lady Hardcastle invited the sixth caller, Dr Fitzsimmons, into the drawing room. I made up another tray of tea and pondered the wisdom of inflicting the vicar’s wife’s cake on the poor chap. On the one hand it seemed the very opposite of hospitable to subject the man to such a terrifying fruitcake, but on the other it was all we had. I felt sure that he would have been exposed to Mrs Bland’s baking before and would be inured to it by now. I cut small slices and served it to them.

From the kitchen I could overhear snippets of their conversation and it seemed that Lady Hardcastle had tried to explain her new obsession to him."
B01ER14CRY1,B01ER14CRY,"During the course of the morning my labours were interrupted no fewer than half a dozen times by the ringing of the doorbell. In London a lady might just about manage to make the acquaintance of her nearest neighbours after a few years if she were particularly gregarious. Out in the West Country it seemed that everyone and his dog wished to find out more about the stranger in their midst.

The Reverend James Bland, vicar of St Arild’s Church, was the first to call, bearing a rather formidable fruitcake baked in Lady Hardcastle’s honour by his wife who, he assured her, would be calling on her own account within a day or two. A butcher’s boy from Spratt ’s called with a note introducing his employer’s shop, followed closely by lads from the baker’s and the grocer’s bearing similar introductions. I couldn’t help thinking that the three establishments might have saved themselves a few pence by employing just one of the lads to run the errand for all of them, but the boys were delighted – Lady Hardcastle gave them each a few coppers for their trouble.

The village policeman called next. Sergeant Dobson said he couldn’t stop. Nevertheless he wanted to pay his respects and reassure"
B016YOCL020,B016YOCL02,"When another person, especially one not related by blood, takes a sincere interest in the wellbeing of my kids, it makes my heart go soft.

I decided Matty Simmons was more than nice. He was a good guy. He was a good friend.

Grace woke me by climbing into my bed at 3:27 a.m., another nightmare. We cuddled and I soothed her. Once she was sleeping peacefully, I started my day.

After skipping my shower and quickly getting dressed, I responded to several work emails, typed detailed directions for the kids, and had three minutes to apply a little makeup before Matty arrived at 5:27 a.m., looking bleary-eyed, nervous, and enthusiastic.

I made it to the hospital by 6:00 a.m. and then waited. And waited. And waited.

But I put the waiting to good use. First, I secured an alternate babysitter for the evening. Then I whipped out my laptop and caught up on my schematics for work. I was feeling good about the status of the project when I was finally told at 10:06 a.m. the hospital was having problems with the MRI machine and the scan would have to be rescheduled.

Beyond irritated, I stemmed my inconvenient urge to (figuratively) shoot the messenger. It wasn’t the medical assistant’s fault the machine wasn’t working, he didn’t deserve my ire."
B016YOCL021,B016YOCL02,"I inwardly cringed as I left the bathroom and jogged to the living room. I swallowed the lump of regret in my throat as I searched for my phone. My head was full of too many thoughts, none of which brought any clarity. The fire ants had been joined by bees. The bees brought their viscous honey, slowing all processes to a virtual halt.

Shell-shocked after what I’d discovered about Jack this afternoon, I’d ushered the kids out of the dance studio and gone through the motions of escorting the children home, making their dinner, and assisting with homework. As usual, I argued with Grace about taking her bath and I negotiated with Jack to a half hour of playing Minecraft, and only after reading one of his chapter books for a full hour.

It was a typical evening in the Archer household: Just the three of us, me tripping over little shoes, Grace preferring dirty to clean, and Jack complaining about the distressing lack of pizza on his plate.

Except my heart was heavy with worry and my head was pounding.

I swiped my thumb across the screen of my cell phone after identifying the caller as our babysitter; my worried heart sank further."
B00SI02A660,B00SI02A66,"The man behind the desk, no taller nor heftier than average, had a kind of puffy appearance, from his fleshy hands to a pillow-like girth to an excessive face, his hairline in deep retreat up to a cluster of curly gray in the vicinity of his ears. Gram called him Sparrowhead behind his back because of what she believed was the quality of birdbrain under that jag of hair. Or sometimes her remarks about her employer were more along the line that he was the sort of person who’d drown kittens to keep himself busy. Regardless of what she thought of him, or he of her, they had maintained a prickly standoff, the boss of the ranch reluctant to fire the tart-tongued cook because of her skill at feeding a crew on the cheap, and the often-disgusted mealmaker who ruled the kitchen putting up with his stingy ways on account of me.

Gram’s bad turn of health was about to bring all that to a crashing end, if I couldn’t do something about it. Wendell— I didn’t dare think of him as Sparrowhead just then—was examining me as if he hadn’t seen me every day of the past couple of years."
B00SI02A661,B00SI02A66,"A long-shanked jinglebob spur a cowboy lost on a trail drive from Texas. A big bone of some beast no longer seen on earth. All stuff like that until the array of Indian things, spearpoints and hide scrapers and flint skinning knives and other remnants of buffalo hunts long before Double W cattle grazed the same land. And resting there prime amid those, the object I longed for, the dark black arrowhead that was my find.

I was heartbroken when Gram made me turn it in. I’d been hunting magpies in the willows when I spotted the glassy sparkle in the gravel bottom of the creek crossing. When I reached in the water and picked it up, the glistening triangular shard of rock was sharper and more pointed than other arrowheads that sometimes surfaced after winter frosts or a big rain. Much more beautiful, too, solid black and slick as glass— which actually it was, I later learned, a hardened volcanic lava called obsidian from somewhere far away — when I stroked it in the palm of my hand. My excitement at gaining such a treasure lasted until I burst into the cookhouse and showed it to Gram, and was given the bad news."
B000QRIHSO0,B000QRIHSO,"He swept the tracks away with the broom, pausing several minutes to admire them before he started. How the treads stood up and cast shadows, mostly, little perfect things. It was funny how little things could be so perfect and no one ever saw them. He looked at this until he was tired of looking (no George to tell him to hurry up) and then worked his way down the short driveway to the road, brushing the tracks away. The plow had gone by in the night, pushing back the snow-dunes the wind made across these country roads where there were open fields to one side and t’other, and any other tracks were gone.

Blaze tromped back to the shack. He went inside. Now it felt warm inside. Getting out of bed it had felt cold, but now it felt warm. That was funny, too — how your sense of things could change. He took off his coat and boots and flannel shirt and sat down to the table in his undershirt and cords. He turned on the radio and was surprised when it didn’t play the rock George listened to but warmed right up to country. Loretta Lynn was singing that your good girl is gonna go bad."
B000QRIHSO1,B000QRIHSO,"But he pulled on his underwear shorts (checking them carefully for stains first), then a thermal undershirt, then a flannel top shirt and a pair of heavy corduroy pants. His Sears workboots were under the bed. His Army surplus parka was hanging on the doorknob. He hunted for his mittens and finally found them on the shelf over the dilapidated woodstove in the combination kitchen-living room. He got his checkered cap with the earflaps and put it on, careful to give the visor a little good-luck twist to the left. Then he went out and got the broom leaning against the door.

The morning was bright and bitter. The moisture in his nose crackled immediately. A gust of wind drove snow as fine as powdered sugar into his face, making him wince. It was all right for George to give orders. George was inside drinking coffee by the stove. Like last night, taking off for a beer, leaving Blaze to figure out the car. And there he would still be if he hadn’t had the dumb luck to find the keys somewhere, either under the floormat or in the glove compartment, he forgot which. Sometimes he didn’t think George was a very good friend."
B00L6C313E0,B00L6C313E,"We were having dinner at Jimmy Watson’s Restaurant in Lygon Street, Carlton, Victoria, Australia, on August 2 of the previous year, nine days before our wedding, and a couple had placed a baby container on the floor between our tables. Rosie mentioned the possibility of us reproducing.

We had by then decided to move to New York, and I argued that we should wait until she had finished her medical course and specialization. Rosie disagreed— she thought that would be leaving it too late. She would be thirty-seven by the time she qualified as a psychiatrist. I suggested that, at a minimum, we wait until the completion of the MD program. The psychiatric qualification was not essential to her planned role as a clinical researcher in mental illness, so if the baby permanently derailed her studies, the impact would not be disastrous. My recollection is that she did not disagree. In any case, a major life decision requires:

1. Articulation of the options, e.g., have zero children; have a specific number of children; sponsor one or more children via a charity.

2. Enumeration of the advantages and disadvantages of each option, e.g., freedom to travel; ability to devote time to work; risk of disruption or grief due to actions of child. Each factor needs to be assigned an agreed weight.

3. Objective comparison of the options using the above."
B00L6C313E1,B00L6C313E,"Once again, my cocktail-making skills would provide a solution.

Rosie and I worked three nights per week at the Alchemist, a cocktail bar on West 19th Street in the Flatiron neighborhood, so drink-making equipment and ingredients were tools of trade (although I had not been able to convince our accountant of this). I located vodka, Galliano and ice cubes, added these to the orange juices and stirred. Rather than commence my drink before Rosie, I poured myself a shot of vodka on ice, added a squeeze of lime, and drank it rapidly. Almost instantly, I felt my stress level returning to its default state.

Finally Rosie emerged from the bathroom. Other than the change in direction of travel, the only difference in her appearance was that her red hair was now wet. But her mood appeared to have elevated: she was almost dancing toward the bedroom. Obviously the scallops had been a good choice.

It was possible that her emotional state would make her more receptive to the Gene Sabbatical, but it seemed advisable to defer the news until the next morning, after we had had sex. Of course, if she realized that I had withheld data for that purpose, I would be criticized. Marriage was complex."
B079WVV3QC0,B079WVV3QC,"You work until the bell rings at the end of your shift. You don’t fuck around at three in the afternoon, recovering from an afternoon slump.

Not that I’m fucking around.

I go on Amazon and search out everything that Simon was talking about, except the ginger ale and crackers— I’ll get that at the bodega on the way home. The lollipops look weird, but I don’t care. I find a tumbler shaped like a Starbucks cup, only with a straw, a delicate snowflake pattern on the edge. Perfect. I add a misting spray meant to help with morning sickness and a relaxing candle to the order. I’ll draw a bath for Sunny, if that’s what she wants.

Everything’s loaded up. I pick the fastest shipping method and dig my wallet out of my pocket. I have a credit card for the first time in my life. It’s a small miracle. Summer has no idea how good it feels to pay for these things for her. I guess she’s been doing it on her own all along.

The phone on my desk rings before I can punch in the credit card numbers and I answer it without looking at the caller ID."
B079WVV3QC1,B079WVV3QC,"I’m not going to stand by the doorway, alone, so I follow him inside.

He looks at me, his expression unreadable, and my heart beats faster.

This is a thousand times more intimate than fucking.

A million.

He takes the hem of his jeans in his hands and rolls them up.

We both look.

His knee is normal.

The three inches of leg below his knee are normal.

Then the leg narrows into a knobby stub and stops.

The roommate whistles in the next room. It’s an oddly similar pitch to the ringing in my ears. The noise fades into the background.

It could have been worse than this.

Whatever happened to him—whatever really happened to him over there—could have ended him. The line between a leg that ends too early and a casket in the cargo hold of a plane is so thin it makes me breathless.

I could have lost him.

Dayton’s prosthetic leans up against the front of the couch. He pulls it close and takes a threadbare liner from inside, rolling it over what’s left of his leg. Then he eases the leg into the prosthetic, pulling it this way and that, not looking at me."
B01M8JW7DQ0,B01M8JW7DQ,"My name is blah-blah-blah, I know how to blah-blah-blah, and wish to join your clan on the following conditions...

I forwarded all the letters concerning prospective personnel to Barsina. If she was appointed head of recruiting last night, let her get an idea of what lies ahead of her. Apply filter…

That’s strange. By my estimates, of the two million letters I had received in the past few hours, about half should have been discarded. And yet this modest wish was smashed like a tiny sloop against the cliffs of reality. Twelve thousand less. I didn’t even know how to feel when I realized that I would have to deal with the remainder on my own. Why are there so few people who want to join my clan anyway?

Excuse me, but are you ignoring me or something? I’m going to find you in reality. I already have your address. We’ll be waiting for you tomorrow, you jerk! I’ll teach you how to respect the right people!

Missives like this were destined for the blacklist without further consideration. Look at that—they’d already found my address! Oh I’m so, so scared. Apply filter…

Thirty percent less. Damn! I was hoping that filter would deal with the majority. What’s the rest about then?"
B01M8JW7DQ1,B01M8JW7DQ,"Her perfect gait was entirely the product of her training and experience.

Trediol—a handsome young man with a military bearing—was standing beside the altar and looking at his approaching bride with unconcealed delight. Several moments was enough for me to understand that this couple were marvelously well-suited for one another. Young, handsome, and independent, they would make excellent governors of some Province.

According to protocol, Tavia paused every two steps to receive the guests’ blessings and, seeing through the veil of ceremony, I could tell she shared her bridegroom’s impatience. Even a momentary delay before the dream of your life reaches you, can be quite tedious. I didn’t know what traditions were invested in these blessings, but Trediol decided to violate them and, in spite of the cautioning cries of the master of ceremonies, rushed toward his Tavia. The girl hesitated for only a moment and, casting off her bridal veil, which was held by two pages, she too darted to Trediol.

No sooner had the two embraced each other, than they began to glow brighter than the sun and an explosion shook the spacious hall, knocking the guests and the decorations to the floor. To everyone’s amazement, both Tavia and Trediol had vanished!"
B004GB1I3C0,B004GB1I3C,"If they could get that kind of control over a mortal, what would happen if they could get their hooks into a wizard? If they could addict a wizard to them as thoroughly as Bianca had the girl I’d just seen? Surely, it wasn’t possible.

But if it wasn’t, why would the Council be so nervous about them?

Do not think I will not make you regret it, she had said.

I felt cold as I hurried down the dark driveway toward the gate.

Fido the security guard was waiting for me at the front gate, and passed back my knife and my cane without a word. A tow truck was out front, latching itself to the Beetle. I put one hand on the cold metal of the gate and kept the other, with its handkerchief, pressed to my throat, as I watched George the tow-truck guy work. He recognized me and waved, flashing a grin that showed the white teeth in his dark face. I nodded back. I wasn’t up to answering the smile.

A few minutes later, the guard’s cellular phone beeped at him. He withdrew several paces, repeated several affirmatives, then took a notebook from his pocket, writing something down. He put the phone away and walked back over to me, offering me the piece of paper."
B004GB1I3C1,B004GB1I3C,"I felt a little sick and withdrew step by step, not turning my back on the scene. Rachel toppled slowly to the floor, writhing her way toward unconsciousness with an evident glee. Bianca followed her down, unladylike now, a creature of bestial hunger. She crouched over the supine woman, and in the hunch of her pale shoulders I could see the batlike thing beneath the flesh mask, lapping up Rachel’s blood.

I got out of there, fast, shutting the door behind me. My heart was hammering, too quickly. The scene with Rachel might have aroused me, if I hadn’t seen what was underneath Bianca’s mask. Instead, it only made me sick to my stomach, afraid. The woman had given herself to that thing, as quickly and as willingly as any woman to her lover.

The saliva, some part of me rationalized, desperate to latch on to something cold and logical and detached. The saliva was probably narcotic, perhaps even addictive. It would explain Rachel’s behavior, the need to have more of her drug. But I wondered if Rachel would have been so eager, had she known Bianca’s true face.

Now I understood why the White Council was so hardnosed with vampires."
B00Z8VTQBK0,B00Z8VTQBK,"Then, there was little that the humans built or used that would harm the land if left to decay on its own. Now there were refineries that processed the crude oil being drawn out of the earth. Now there were places that stored fuel. Now there were industries that might damage the land if left untended. How much would be harmed if those things were destroyed or abandoned?

Simon had no answers, and the terra indigene who watched over the wild country—the dangerous, primal beings who cloaked their true terra indigene nature in forms so old those shapes had no names—would not be concerned with answers. Even if everything else disappeared from the world to make room for the new that would be born from destruction and change, they would still exist.

The terra indigene shifters like the Wolves and Bears, the Hawks and Crows, referred to those forms as the Elders, a benevolent-sounding word for the beings who were Namid’s teeth and claws.

Meg returned from the bathroom, looking a little more awake and a lot less happy to see him. She was going to be more unhappy when she found out why he wanted to take this walk."
B00Z8VTQBK1,B00Z8VTQBK,"By doing those things, humans had drawn the attention of terra indigene who usually stayed away from human-controlled places while their intentions were benevolent.

Those earth natives, who lived deep in the wild country, had decided that the humans living in Thaisia had committed a breach of trust, and all agreements between humans and the Others might be rescinded. Probably would be rescinded. Already there were restrictions on what kind of cargo could be carried by ships traveling on the Great Lakes. There were restrictions on what kind of human could travel from one human city to another. The human governments that oversaw human concerns on a regional level were reeling from the sanctions. If ships couldn’t carry food and merchandise from one region to another, if trains couldn’t carry food and fuel to cities that needed both, what would happen to all the humans living on the continent?

If the humans who were supposed to be in charge had paid any attention to Thaisia’s history, they would know what would happen to the humans. The invasive, two-legged predators would be eliminated, and the land would be reclaimed by the earth natives, the terra indigene, the Others.

But that wouldn’t be as easy to do as it had been a few centuries ago."
B00276HAEY0,B00276HAEY,"Dwarfish craftsmen gathered with their kin, who were often hired to protect the merchant caravans and were armed to the teeth. Their groups tolerated at best the gnome miners and halfling farmers who camped beside them. All non-humans were uniformly distant towards humans. The humans repaid in kind, but were not seen to mix amongst themselves either. Nobility looked down on the merchants and travelling salesmen with open scorn, while soldiers and mercenaries distanced themselves from shepherds and their reeking sheepskins. The few wizards and their disciples kept themselves entirely apart from the others, and bestowed their arrogance on everyone in equal parts. A tight-knit, dark and silent group of peasants lurked in the background. Resembling a forest with their rakes, pitchforks and flails poking above their heads, they were ignored by all and sundry.

The exception, as ever, was the children. Freed from the constraints of silence which had been enforced during the bard’s performance, the children dashed into the woods with wild cries, and enthusiastically immersed themselves in a game whose rules were incomprehensible to all those who had bidden farewell to the happy years of childhood. Children of elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, half-elves, quarter-elves and toddlers of mysterious provenance neither knew nor recognised racial or social divisions. At least, not yet."
B00276HAEY1,B00276HAEY,"Having blown their noses, the baron’s daughters gazed at Dandelion in adoration—which went entirely unnoticed by the bard, engrossed as he was in smiling, winking and flashing his teeth at a haughty, silent group of roving elves, and at one of them in particular: a dark-haired, large-eyed beauty sporting a tiny ermine cap. Dandelion had rivals for her attention—the elf, with her huge eyes and beautiful toque hat, had caught his audience’s interest as well, and a number of knights, students and goliards were paying court to her with their eyes. The elf clearly enjoyed the attention, picking at the lace cuffs of her chemise and fluttering her eyelashes, but the group of elves with her surrounded her on all sides, not bothering to hide their antipathy towards her admirers.

The glade beneath Bleobheris, the great oak, was a place of frequent rallies, a well-known travellers’ resting place and meeting ground for wanderers, and was famous for its tolerance and openness. The druids protecting the ancient tree called it the Seat of Friendship and willingly welcomed all comers. But even during an event as exceptional as the world-famous troubadour’s just-concluded performance the travellers kept to themselves, remaining in clearly delineated groups. Elves stayed with elves."
B071L5X4YK0,B071L5X4YK,"He took to the water gratefully, but complained the cold was intolerable, and she managed to procure a used neoprene wet suit, two sizes too large, that made the daily plunge bearable. Each day brought advances and, rare setbacks aside, DeBolt progressed in but one direction. The headaches lessened, and so correspondingly did his need for pain medication. New examinations were introduced—memory games, mathematical puzzles, cognitive exercises. She assured him in every case that he performed well.

Yet as the patient was improving, he sensed a notable decline in his caregiver. She seemed increasingly withdrawn and distant, more so each time he pressed her for an explanation of how he’d ended up in a beach house in New England after the frozen Bering Sea. Her descending mood was more apparent each day, relentless and foreboding. One morning, as she counted his push-ups on the beach, he spotted a young girl far in the distance. She was eight, perhaps ten years old, prancing barefoot through tide pools with a net and a bucket. As she neared the edge of the rock outcropping where she was gathering creatures, DeBolt recognized a shift in the sea beyond—a strong rip current funneling offshore. He said they should warn the girl to stay clear of the water. Chandler responded by immediately ushering him shoreward."
B071L5X4YK1,B071L5X4YK,"He turned his head gingerly, examining the place in detail, and found every limit of movement a new adventure in pain.

What was it about this room?

Then it struck him. It was completely devoid of anything electronic. No television, no computer, not even a microwave in the tiny kitchen. He had yet to see Joan use a cell phone, which in this day and age was striking. Was the place that remote, completely beyond cell coverage? Or was his nurse an antitechnology type, a back-to-basics pioneer with a vegetable garden and two chickens out back, a wind generator on the chimney?

Whatever.

He sat up straight, fighting a stab of pain in his skull. Never one to sit still, DeBolt began moving his arms, up and down, rotating in expanding circles. Not bad. He graduated to leg lifts, but that somehow involved the muscles in his upper back, and a bolt of lightning struck the base of his neck. He lay back down.

A car crunched closer on gravel outside. DeBolt heard the engine die, a door open and close. Then an unfamiliar voice as Joan Chandler began conversing with someone—apparently a neighbor. Most of it he didn’t catch. But he heard enough.

Soon she was inside with an armload of groceries, the visitor having been sent packing."
B071JXWDGF0,B071JXWDGF,"The spices, the onions, the tobacco from the cigarette shelf, blood from the meat counter, and the earthen smell of silk fabric and wool carpets stacked in the store’s back room. When my mother lived, the smell of burning wood from her brick oven woke me in the morning, and in the afternoon, the smell of white ash and hot bread comforted me. There was nothing soft or fancy about that place, but I remembered feeling safe. Now that Elias was gone, I hoped I would have that feeling again.

The floor above me creaked where Nelly and Marina moved. Then I heard steps on the porch. Eli opened the screen door and stood, pale and young, in the black dress of a priest. He looked like his father thirty years ago, tall and thin, the angular face framed by jet hair, cropped short. The difference between the two: Eli stood with his shoulders slumped, his head hanging low, as if he did not feel worthy of his height or the power of a man’s body. His father had always stood straight and moved with confidence—or false confidence, unsuspected by anyone, even me. Elias’s expression had been intense, no matter the emotion, whether he was speaking kindly to a customer or glowering at me. Eli’s gaze was soft, forgiving, so unlike his father’s, but their eyes were the same."
B071JXWDGF1,B071JXWDGF,"But money could only raise you so high. We were curiosities, and we had to be extra careful what we did or didn’t do.

Yesterday, Elias had walked in our door and stood in the same spot I was now standing, between the dining and the living rooms, the heart of the home. He noticed nothing of the furniture or the fine things we had. His eyes lit on Orlando Washington, a glass of water in his hand, sitting at our dining-room table, and me across from him.

In my pocket, I fingered the paper on which Elias had written Orlando Washington’s name and address. Elias had accused me of more than I had done, but now the accusations were dead with him.

Soon, the funeral men would carry Elias’s body down the wide stairs and out the front door. I would have no reasons to dread life here. I had itched to have Elias and this house, finer than my childhood home with its rough edges, cracked plaster walls, and beams of wood showing from the ceiling. The furniture was hard and the windows leaked. The odors of the store drifted up to the bedrooms and clung to the curtains and bedsheets."
B000FC2ROU0,B000FC2ROU,"One or two getting sunstroke is one thing, but sixteen children simultaneously coming down with it was out of the question.

My next thought was some kind of poison gas or nerve gas, either naturally occurring or man-made. But how in the world could gas appear in the middle of the woods in such a remote part of the country? I couldn’t account for it. Poison gas, though, would logically explain what I saw that day. Everyone breathed it in, went unconscious, and collapsed on the spot. The homeroom teacher didn’t collapse because the concentration of gas wasn’t strong enough to affect an adult.

But when it came to treating the children, I was totally lost. I’m just a simple country doctor and have no special expertise in poison gasses, so I was out of my league. We were out in this remote town and I couldn’t very well ring up a specialist. Very gradually, in fact, some of the children were getting better, and I figured that perhaps with time they would all regain consciousness. I know it’s an overly optimistic view, but at the time I couldn’t think of anything else to do. So I suggested that we just let them lie there quietly for a while and see what developed."
B000FC2ROU1,B000FC2ROU,"I picked up several other children and examined them and they were all exactly the same, unresponsive. I found this quite odd.

I next checked their pulse and temperature. Their pulses were between 50 and 55, and all of them had temperatures just below 97 degrees. Somewhere around 96 degrees or thereabouts, as I recall. That’s correct—for children of that age this pulse rate is well below normal, the body temperature over one degree below average. I smelled their breath, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Likewise with their throats and tongues.

I immediately ascertained these weren’t the symptoms of food poisoning. Nobody had vomited or suffered diarrhea, and none of them seemed to be in any pain. If the children had eaten something bad you could expect—with this much time having elapsed—the onset of at least one of these symptoms. I heaved a sigh of relief that it wasn’t food poisoning. But then I was stumped, since I hadn’t a clue what was wrong with them.

The symptoms were similar to sunstroke. Kids often collapse from this in the summer. It’s like it’s contagious— once one of them collapses their friends all do the same, one after the other. But this was November, in a cool woods, no less."
B078X8B7LV0,B078X8B7LV,"He’d lived in Belhaven for as long as Gloria could remember, right out on the edge of town in a purple house. Actually, just around the corner from Gloria’s farm. He was a loner. Rumor had it he was filthy rich but you would never know it by looking at him – or his house. He was a scrawny little man with long, shaggy hair. He drove a beat up old van that seemed to break down every other day.

Odd thing about Walking Stan was, you would see his van on the side of the road, hood up as if the engine just conked out. A short distance away, he would be thumbing a ride to wherever. Hours later, the van would be gone from the side of the road and more often than not, could be found sitting in his driveway, right next to the purple house. Folks said he was so cheap, he would pretend to have engine trouble just so he could catch a free ride and save on gas.

He wasn’t really scary and most people didn’t mind giving him a lift if they were going in the same direction. He was a man of few words, though. No one really knew where he came from or if he even had any family."
B078X8B7LV1,B078X8B7LV,"This was apparently some sort of test to see if Gloria could keep up because the trot soon became a full out run. By the time they reached the barn, Gloria’s yard shoes were long gone, abandoned halfway between the gravel drive and the barn door.

Gloria plucked the hidden key from above the door frame and unlocked the shiny new padlock. The door was open mere inches before Mally managed to wiggle her way inside. She stood motionless for a second, as if overwhelmed by all the new smells and sights around her.

It didn’t take long for curiosity to get the best of her as she yanked Gloria across the barn floor towards the milking parlor. With the thoroughness of a Bloodhound, the dog investigated every single stall, sniffing posts, piles of straw and anything else Gloria would let her get close enough to. After that, they worked their way back out to the main barn area.

A perimeter sniff was now in order. Much to Gloria’s relief, the dog gave an all-clear when she decided there wasn’t anything left in the barn to hold her interest.

Gloria locked the barn and headed in the direction of her missing shoes. Mally suddenly let out a low growl followed by a loud bark."
B01NAFLSXD0,B01NAFLSXD,"Kit sprang forward and led him to a listening booth, not exactly holding his hand, but leading the way with outstretched arms as if parts of the man were in danger of dropping off at any moment. Light bloomed from the lava lamps in shifting patterns of pink and apple green and gold. The booths were nothing like the ones in Woolworth’s —those were more like standing up in a hair dryer. Their headphones were so greasy, Maud said, you had to shower afterwards. No, these booths Frank had made himself from a pair of matching Victorian wardrobes of incredible magnitude he had spotted on a skip. He had sawn off the feet, removed the hanging rails and sets of drawers, and drilled small holes to connect each one with cable to his turntable. Frank had found two armchairs, small enough to fit inside, but comfortable. He had even polished the wood until it gleamed like black gloss paint, revealing a delicate inlay in the doors of mother-of-pearl birds and flowers. The booths were beautiful when you really looked.

The man stepped in and made a sideways shuffle — there was very little space; he was being asked to sit in a piece of bedroom furniture, after all—and took his place. Frank helped with the headphones and shut the door."
B01NAFLSXD1,B01NAFLSXD,"He had missed a patch on his chin when he was shaving. There was something lonesome about it, that scratchy patch of stubble, all on its own.

So Frank smiled because he always smiled when a customer asked for help. He asked the same questions he always asked. Did the man know what he was looking for? (Yes. Chopin.) Had he heard anything else that he liked? (Yes. Chopin.) Could he hum it? (No. He didn’t think he could.)

The man shot a look over his shoulder to make sure no one was listening, but they weren’t. Over the years, they’d seen everything in the music shop. There were the regular customers, of course, who came to find new records, but often people wanted something more. Frank had helped them through illness, grief, loss of confidence, and loss of jobs, as well as the more daily things like football results and the weather. Not that he knew about all those things, but really it was a matter of listening, and he had endless patience. As a boy, he could stand for hours with a piece of bread in his hand, hoping for a bird.

But the man was gazing at Frank. He was waiting."
B003F1WMCK0,B003F1WMCK,"They discovered the kettle about to boil, a freshly baked marble cake waiting to be iced, and a tiny baby waking for her feed–but no sign of her parents, Alice and Jack Munro.

The only clues that violence may have taken place were a few drops of dried blood on the kitchen floor and one upturned chair. (Please do not attempt to look under the chair.) The bodies of Alice and Jack have never been found, and over seventy years later their disappearance remains one of Australia’s most famous unsolved mysteries.

The sisters, Connie and Rose, took the tiny baby home and reared her as their own child. They named her Enigma–you can guess why! Connie, Rose and little Enigma (now a Grandma Enigma!) are all still residents of Scribbly Gum Island, as are Enigma’s two daughters, Margaret and Laura, and their families.

Note: For obvious health and hygiene reasons the cooling marble cake you will see during your tour is not the original cake but actually a freshly baked one, made to Alice’s delicious original recipe. Enjoy a complimentary piece after your tour!

Aunt Connie is really cross with her."
B003F1WMCK1,B003F1WMCK,"he was having far too good a time, gulping deep breaths of air as if it was the first day of a holiday, tipping back his head so the winter sun was on his face. He made her want to giggle helplessly like a child. She had to turn her head and pretend to be fascinated by the flight of a pelican.

Now, Jimmy Thrum the reporter was sitting at the Doughty family’s kitchen table, gulping down his second cup of tea and munching into his third biscuit with a spray of crumbs, which he quickly tried to clean up by licking his finger and dabbing at them.

From the way he was listening to her, it seemed that he wasn’t just interested in her story, he was positively enthralled by it. I hope he’s not making fun of me, thought Connie with sudden suspicion. Shouldn’t a newspaper man be a little less excited?

If he was faking it, he was doing a very good job. A couple of times he’d even slapped his thigh.

She took the opportunity to covertly study him while he bent his head to scribble in his notepad. He had a knobbly neck. Unexpectedly hairy forearms. There were curls springing up one by one from his slicked-down hair. He was writing in a mixture of what Connie assumed were shorthand symbols and words."
B01MTJQK9M0,B01MTJQK9M,"Moomi was there with me when I sat on a prayer mat for three days, chanting words that I didn’t understand over and over until I fainted on the third day, cutting short what should have been a seven-day fast and vigil.

While I recovered in a ward at Wesley Guild Hospital, she held my hand and asked me to pray for strength. A good mother’s life is hard, she said, a woman can be a bad wife but she must not be a bad mother. Moomi told me that before asking God to give me a child, I must ask for the grace to be able to suffer for that child. She said I wasn’t ready to be a mother yet if I was fainting after three days of fasting.

I realised then that she had not fainted on the third day because she had probably gone on that kind of fast several times to appease God on behalf of her children. In that moment, the lines etched around Moomi’s eyes and mouth became sinister, they began to mean more to me than signs of old age. I was torn. I wanted to be this thing that I never had. I wanted to be a mother, to have my eyes shine with secret joys and wisdom like Moomi’s. Yet all her talk about suffering was terrifying."
B01MTJQK9M1,B01MTJQK9M,"Apologetic smiles, pity-me smiles, I-look-unto-God smiles—name all the fake smiles needed to get through an afternoon with a group of people who claim to want the best for you while poking at your open sore with a stick— and I had them ready. I was ready to listen to them tell me I must do something about my situation. I expected to hear about a new pastor I could visit; a new mountain where I could go to pray; or an old herbalist in a remote village or town whom I could consult. I was armed with smiles for my lips, an appropriate sheen of tears for my eyes and sniffles for my nose. I was prepared to lock up my hairdressing salon throughout the coming week and go in search of a miracle with my mother-in-law in tow. What I was not expecting was another smiling woman in the room, a yellow woman with a blood-red mouth who grinned like a new bride.

 I wished my mother-in-law were there. She was the only woman I had ever called Moomi. I visited her more often than her son did. She had watched while my fresh perm was washed off into a flowing river by a priest whose theory was that I had been cursed by my mother before she died, minutes after giving birth to me."
B06Y2H1KM90,B06Y2H1KM9,"They’d set up shop in the parking lot of an apartment complex across the street from the Burger King where the most recent body had been found. They were tucked back in the shadows pretty good, their car nestled among the sedans and mini-vans of the people who lived in the building, but they had a clear view.

Both officers sported plainclothes, of course, and they sat in Novotny’s Mustang rather than their standard cruiser. McAdoo decided to wear his holster since that wouldn’t blow their cover so long as he stayed in the car, but he found himself unable to get comfortable with the gun in these bucket seats. Everything was so much smaller and more narrow than what he was used to in the cruiser. It didn’t make much sense to him, but no matter which way he shifted, the gun kept digging into his hip.

Novotny switched out his toothpick, replacing it with a wad of Skoal from the hockey puck sized can he’d removed from his breast pocket. With the tobacco secured in his bulging lip, he lifted the binoculars to his face, and McAdoo followed his gaze. They looked at the Burger King across the street. The image of that bloody bag of body parts flashed in the portly cop’s head, but the lot was empty. Dark."
B06Y2H1KM91,B06Y2H1KM9,"She poked her head in the bathroom just long enough to see her reflection in the harsh fluorescent light, and that pretty much completed the tour.

Her palms went clammy again. She was nervous about meeting Agent Loshak.

Better to get it over with then, she thought.

She marched out the door and down the concrete catwalk that gave access to the second floor rooms. She paused in front of the neighboring room, fist poised to knock. She hesitated. The door suddenly seemed intimidating. Agent Loshak wouldn’t be happy to have another agent sent out here to check on him. Less than another agent, maybe. A glorified babysitter. She steeled herself for combat.

Her knuckles rapped against the door. One, two, three.

A grunt answered from inside the room, then the squeak of a creaky subfloor, and then silence. Darger figured Loshak was watching her through the peephole, and she made an effort to look official, standing straight and tall with her chin lifted slightly.

Finally, she heard the clatter of the door being unlocked. The knob turned and a pair of red-rimmed eyes surrounded by pale flesh peered back at her through the crack. Despite the sickly pallor, there was something striking in his gaze. A wry look. Clever."
B075QP4H2N0,B075QP4H2N,"Once again, beads of cold perspiration erupted on her back as she remembered the sight she would never forget.

When the Duke had turned to face her in the chapel, the ruination of the right side of his face was plain. The skin was a mixture of angry red and purple with raised lines of silvery white, shiny skin. He had been burned; that much was clear.

The burn had taken almost all that side of his face, and she could see that it would continue down his neck, somewhere beneath his smart necktie. Perhaps the scarring had taken all that side of his body, there was no way of knowing.

His hair seemed largely intact on that side, barring a small, shiny patch of skin by his left temple. Apart from that, the only other part of that side of his face still intact, still as it ought to have been, was his other eye. It stood out starkly, beautiful and green, against the dark and angry skin of his face.

Isabella remembered that in those last moments before the world grew dark, she had stared into those green eyes, and they had fixed her with such a look of pain that she could not bear it.

The door to the chamber opened suddenly, and Isabella gasped."
B075QP4H2N1,B075QP4H2N,"The idea that this man was about to kiss her was more than she could stand and, with a deepening sense of panic and her breaths coming harder and harder, spots appeared before her eyes.

Isabella tried to blink, tried to stay upright but, in the end, she could not. Blackness overtook her, and she was unconscious before she hit the flagstones of the chapel floor.

Chapter 4

When she finally awoke, it was to find herself laying in a large and comfortable bed. Her head was throbbing horribly, and she had no idea where she was.

With that sense of dread that one gets when waking in a strange place, Isabella determined not to open her eyes fully and, instead, simply peered through the tiniest gap. She did not want anybody present to know that she had awoken, at least not until she had her bearings and her memories intact once more.

When she realized that she was alone in the room, Isabella let her eyes fly wide open. She tried to sit up in the bed, despite the throbbing pain. She reached up to touch the back of her head and could feel a pronounced lump there. She must have hit her head surely, or been hit.

Slowly, her memories began to glide back in."
B004TU74YW0,B004TU74YW,"Should’ve called it Spooky Hollow, she decided, and nearly missed the turn into the gravel lane.

Why, she wondered, would anyone choose to live here? Amid all those dense, thrusting trees where bleak pools of snow huddled to hide from the sun? Where the only sound was the warning growl of Nature. Everything was brown and gray and moody.

She bumped over a little bridge spanning a curve of a creek, followed the slight rise of the stingy lane.

There was the house, exactly as advertised.

It sat on what she would have termed a knoll rather than a hill, with the front slope tamed into step-down terraces decked with shrubs she imagined put on a hell of a show in the spring and summer.

There wasn’t a lawn, so to speak, and she thought Hawkins had been smart to go with the thick mulch and shrubs and trees skirting the front instead of the traditional grass that would probably be a pain in the ass to mow and keep clear of weeds.

She approved of the deck that wrapped around the front and sides, and she’d bet the rear as well. She liked the earthy tones of the stone and the generous windows."
B004TU74YW1,B004TU74YW,"The fast-food joints, the businesses, the ass-to-elbow houses gave way to bigger lawns, bigger homes, and to fields sleeping under the dreary sky.

The road wound, dipped and lifted, then veered straight again. She saw a sign for the Antietam Battlefield, something else she meant to investigate and research firsthand. She’d found little snippets about incidents during the Civil War in and around Hawkins Hollow.

She wanted to know more.

When her GPS and Caleb’s directions told her to turn, she turned, following the next road past a grove of naked trees, a scatter of houses, and the farms that always made her smile with their barns and silos and fenced paddocks.

She’d have to find a small town to explore in the Midwest next time. A haunted farm, or the weeping spirit of a milkmaid.

She nearly ignored the directions to turn when she saw the sign for Hawkins Hollow (est. 1648). As with the Quarter Pounder, her heart longed to indulge, to drive into town rather than turn off toward Caleb Hawkins’s place. But she hated to be late, and if she got caught up exploring the streets, the corners, the look of the town, she certainly would be late for her first appointment."
B00FPQA4F00,B00FPQA4F0,"When the reactor had gone on Aten Base, his partner and supervisor had both panicked, and Havelock remembered the overwhelming fear in his own gut. When the riots had started on Ceres after the ice hauler Canterbury had been destroyed, his partner had been more weary than fearful, and Havelock had faced the situation with the same grim resignation. When the Ebisu had been quarantined for nipahvirus, his boss had been energized — almost elated—running the ship like a puzzle that had to be solved, and Havelock had been caught up in the pleasure of doing an important thing well.

Humans, Havelock knew from long experience, were first and foremost social animals, and he himself was profoundly human. It was more romantic—hell, more masculine—to pretend he was an island, unaffected by the waves of emotion around him. But it wasn’t true, and he’d made his peace with that fact.

When the word came that the heavy shuttle’s landing pad had exploded and the reports of casualties started coming in, Murtry’s response had been an efficient and focused rage, and so Havelock’s had been too. All the activity was on the planetary surface, so the only outlet had been on the Edward Israel itself. And how things went on the Israel were firmly in Havelock ’s wheelhouse."
B00FPQA4F01,B00FPQA4F0,"Some arcane structure left from the alien civilization that had designed the protomolecule and the rings, abandoned and empty now. Elvi had the sudden, powerful and disjointed memory of an art exhibit she’d seen as a girl. There had been a high-resolution image of a bicycle in a ditch outside the ruins of Glasgow. The aftermath of disaster in a single image, as compressed and eloquent as a poem.

At least I got to see it, she thought. At least I got to be here before I died.

Someone had dragged her out of the ruined shuttle. When she turned her head, she could see construction lights burning yellow-white and the others laid out on the flat ground in rows. Some were standing. Moving among the injured and the dead. She didn’t recognize their faces or the way their bodies moved. After a year and a half on the Israel, she knew everyone on sight, and these were strangers. The locals, then. The squatters. Illegals. The air smelled like burning dust and cumin.

She must have blacked out, because the woman seemed to appear at Elvi’s side in the blink of an eye. Her hands were bloody and her face smeared with dirt and gore not her own."
B0180YBIYY0,B0180YBIYY,"I shook my head clear of the twisted memories of my most recent nightmare, knowing Hemingway’s story would find a nice, comfy spot in my subconscious for later nightmares.

Yippee.

The tumbler of whisky abruptly shattered in my fist, causing the blood to flow freely again from my previous wound. I hissed, sticking my palm to my mouth in irritation. I was systematically destroying all the glasses the bar had to offer. Before I consciously thought about it, I had slapped a crisp, new hundred-dollar bill – the kind that looked like monopoly money – on the warped bar, prepaying for a new round of drinks. It spent the same as the old bill, although I was willing to bet the bartender had never seen one before. Sometimes I forgot how others viewed money. I had been born into it, and couldn’t fathom having to work my body to the bone in order to achieve it. My parents had created a multibillion-dollar company, Temple Industries, specializing in all forms of technology. I was no stranger to making money of my own, but I was a stranger to living on the line, never knowing how the next bill would be paid.

It was a humbling thought. What was I without my money?

Several patrons scowled at me. The bartender grunted as he poured me a fresh glass."
B0180YBIYY1,B0180YBIYY,"Every culture had purges of a sort where they tried to banish, maim, or outright murder the Freaks that stood out for their unique abilities. Although the world had progressed since those times, it was still a tough nut to swallow, and we liked it that way. We preferred it, actually.

However, recent events had blatantly smeared my name across the evening news as not only the well-known, corrupt, billionaire playboy, but also a dangerous wizard. Most took it in stride, assuming the media had been desperate to sell copy that day, coming up with outlandish stories to garner viewers, but many more wanted explanations. Explanations I wouldn’t provide. I wasn’t about to confirm their allegations. Do I look crazy to you?

I turned back to my drink – exhaustion threatening to overwhelm me as I took another sip – hoping the excessive amount of alcohol would help keep me awake. Any time I closed my eyes for more than a few seconds, it was even odds that I would be sucked into another of my night terrors. Maybe it was post-traumatic stress disorder from the dragon ordeal. I had never before experienced such a prolonged malady, and was starting to show signs of wear as a result."
B000FCK9D60,B000FCK9D6,"Toast Melba, butter, an ice pail, all the adjuncts to a meal of quality.

The Negro orchestra broke into an ecstasy of strange discordant noises. London danced.

Hercule Poirot looked on, registered impressions in his neat orderly mind.

How bored and weary most of the faces were! Some of those stout men, however, were enjoying themselves…whereas a patient endurance seemed to be the sentiment exhibited on their partners’ faces. The fat woman in purple was looking radiant… Undoubtedly the fat had certain compensations in life… a zest—a gusto—denied to those of more fashionable contours.

A good sprinkling of young people—some vacant-looking— some bored —some definitely unhappy. How absurd to call youth the time of happiness—youth, the time of greatest vulnerability!

His glance softened as it rested on one particular couple. A well-matched pair—tall broad-shouldered man, slender delicate girl. Two bodies that moved in perfect rhythm of happiness. Happiness in the place, the hour, and in each other.

The dance stopped abruptly. Hands clapped and it started again. After a second encore the couple returned to their table close by Poirot. The girl was flushed, laughing. As she sat, he could study her face, lifted laughing to her companion.

There was something else beside laughter in her eyes. Hercule Poirot shook his head doubtfully."
B000FCK9D61,B000FCK9D6,"It was his own family seat, Charltonbury, and in the foreground stood a figure—a girl’s figure, with bright golden hair and an eager confident face…Linnet as mistress of Charltonbury!

He felt very hopeful. That refusal of hers had not been at all a definite refusal. It had been little more than a plea for time. Well, he could afford to wait a little….

How amazingly suitable the whole thing was! It was certainly advisable that he should marry money, but not such a matter of necessity that he could regard himself as forced to put his own feelings on one side. And he loved Linnet. He would have wanted to marry her even if she had been practically penniless, instead of one of the richest girls in England. Only, fortunately, she was one of the richest girls in England….

His mind played with attractive plans for the future. The Mastership of the Roxdale perhaps, the restoration of the west wing, no need to let the Scotch shooting….

Charles Windlesham dreamed in the sun.

It was four o’clock when the dilapidated little two-seater stopped with a sound of crunching gravel. A girl got out of it—a small slender creature with a mop of dark hair. She ran up the steps and tugged at the bell."
B06ZYSH7JS0,B06ZYSH7JS,"I slouched over to my usual spot, about a third of the way from the front, and sat down before hauling my textbooks out of my bag, trying not to look up every time someone else walked in. Fin normally sat a couple of seats across from me, over near the window, so he’d probably pass right by me when he arrived. Sian was in a different academic set, so I didn’t share any lessons with her, apart from PE.

Mr Williams sat at his desk, engrossed in his marking. Few of the teachers at Shelborne looked like they enjoyed their jobs, and Mr Williams was no exception, his face set in a permanent scowl. When my parents moved here, they hadn’t realised there was such a huge difference between standards of schools in the area. Unfortunately, I’d ended up in the one with the worst reputation in the whole of the South of England. It was safe to say I had no love for the place, but at least I found the work easy. Plus, I had my best friend, and I was quite possibly on the verge of acquiring my very first boyfriend. Education was a frequent topic of conversation between my parents, though, and I lived in fear of them yanking me out of a school I knew, to enrol me somewhere else where I’d have to start all over again."
B06ZYSH7JS1,B06ZYSH7JS,"I hadn’t been targeted by any of the older girls yet, but it was a rough school compared to the one back home, and Sian said I was as likely to get my head kicked in for being too pretty and from a foreign country (even though I had no trace of an accent anymore), as I was for being too fat, or too weird, or whatever else the school bullies thought deserved their attention. But today fear wasn’t the thing that had me preoccupied. No. History was the first lesson of the day that I shared with Fin. My stomach turned over at the thought of seeing him. Would he acknowledge me after our swim last Friday?

I had spent the whole weekend going over every word he’d said at the beach, every look he had given me. Was it because he was interested, or was I simply another friend, another hanger-on? Did he see me differently? I hoped so. I hadn’t been able to eat or sleep, and I hadn’t wanted to listen to anything my parents or brothers had to say. All their boring talk had dragged me away from my thoughts of Fin. Couldn’t they see I needed to be alone? To think. To dream.

I finally reached Mr William’s class with my pulse racing, smoothed my hair and walked in. A quick scan of the room showed only a handful of students had arrived before me – Fin not among them."
B000FC1PRA0,B000FC1PRA,"The squealing continued, too loud even for Savannah’s brashest wharf rats.

I edged closer, kicked aside a length of rusted-out gutter, and saw a little black-and-white wriggling hairball. He had a pink nose with black spots and he was no bigger than a one-pound sack of flour. At first he looked like he was covered with flour. It turned out it was just plaster dust from the junk pile. It was also instant love. I left the stained glass, tucked the puppy and the porch rails under each arm, and ran like a thief back to my carriage house.

As for the puppy, the vet said he was part beagle, part German shepherd, and mostly mutt. It cost me two hundred dollars for all the shots and the deworming medicine. He’s the only dog I’ve ever owned. Daddy would never hear of a dog, him being a mailman and everything. I named him Jethro, for Jethro Tull, the rock group, and Jethro Bodine, the Beverly Hillbillies hunk.

Tal called his lawyer and then my lawyer the first time he glanced out the back window and saw Jethro lift a leg on a camellia bush in his half of the walled garden."
B000FC1PRA1,B000FC1PRA,"The Field and Streams alone would bring fifteen dollars a pop from my antiquarian book guy in Charleston.

I pawed through the boxes like a woman possessed, rejecting thirty years worth of National Geographic s and all Mr. Lowenstein’s banking records from the 1950s, but separating out a stack of hemstitched Irish linen bedsheets and pillowcases, yellowing lace curtains, and a pile of women’s satin and silk slips, nighties, and peignoirs. When I opened a metal foot-locker containing Mr. Lowenstein’s World War II army uniforms, I knew I’d found something good. Stashed under the uniform was a fabulous cache of forties and fifties pinup girl calendars, playing cards, and magazines. As soon as I spotted the first Vargas girl calendar, I began to appreciate the fact that Arnold Lowenstein had been a true connoisseur of nudie art. I loved him more when I found the first issue of Playboy, dated 1951, and the subsequent issue that featured the famous Marilyn Monroe pictorial.

After an hour, I was filthy, smudged with dust and mildew, my clothes littered with dead silverfish. I reeked of mothballs, but I was happy.

I sat back on my heels and looked up at Mr. Greenaway, who’d been pretending to read the newspaper."
B004AM5R480,B004AM5R48,"She had a small impish face, curly dark hair and very dark eyes that suggested mischief. Her mouth was like a pink bow. Staring at her, Mack thought I’d like to kiss her now. Just as the notion crossed his mind she caught his eye. He looked away, embarrassed, as if she might have read his mind.

The sermon came to an end. In addition to the usual Presbyterian service there was to be a christening today: Mack’s cousin Jen had given birth to her fourth child. Her eldest, Wullie, was already working down the pit. Mack had decided that the most appropriate time for his announcement was during the christening. As the moment drew near he felt a watery sensation in his stomach. Then he told himself not to be foolish: he risked his life every day down a mine —why should he be nervous about defying a fat merchant?

Jen stood at the font, looking weary. She was only thirty but she had borne four children and worked down the pit for twenty-three years and she was worn out. Mr. York sprinkled water on her baby’s head. Then her husband, Saul, repeated the form of words that made a slave of every Scottish miner’s son."
B004AM5R481,B004AM5R48,"Lady Hallim and her daughter, Lizzie, were familiar. Lizzie Hallim had long been a source of sensation and scandal in the glen. People said she roamed around in men’s clothing, with a gun over her shoulder. She would give her boots to a barefoot child then berate its mother for not scrubbing her doorstep. Mack had not set eyes on her for years. The Hallim estate had its own church, so they did not come here every Sunday, but they visited when the Jamissons were in residence, and Mack recalled seeing Lizzie on the last occasion, when she had been about fifteen; dressed as a fine lady, but throwing stones at squirrels just like a boy.

Mack’s mother had once been a ladies’ maid at High Glen House, the Hallim mansion, and after she married she had sometimes gone back, on a Sunday afternoon, to see her old friends and show off her twin babies. Mack and Esther had played with Lizzie on those visits—probably without the knowledge of Lady Hallim. Lizzie had been a little minx: bossy, selfish and spoiled. Mack had kissed her once, and she had pulled his hair and made him cry. She looked as though she had not changed much."
B00HXYKYIE0,B00HXYKYIE,"Just in case, though, I cough. Loudly.

With the bike frame balanced against my hip, I press my ear against the door.

You’re troubled by a very big decision.

There is a gasp, a second voice. How did you know?

You have serious doubts that what you decide is going to be the right path.

The other voice, again: It’s been so hard, without Bert.

He’s here now. And he wants you to know that you can trust your heart.

There is a pause. That doesn’t sound like Bert.

Of course not. That was someone else who’s watching over you.

Auntie Louise?

Yes! She says you were always her favorite.

I can’t help it; I snort. Way to recover, Serenity, I think.

Maybe she’s heard me laugh, because there’s no more conversation coming from the other side of the door. I lean closer to listen more carefully, and knock the bike off balance. Stumbling to keep my footing, I trip over my mother’s scarf, which has unraveled. The bicycle—and I—crash into the little table, and the bowl falls off and shatters.

The door is yanked open, and I look up from where I’m crouched in the pretzel of bike frame, trying to gather the pieces."
B00HXYKYIE1,B00HXYKYIE,"I’m nervous about leaving my bike on the street, since I don’t have a lock for it — I never have to lock it up at school or on Main Street or anywhere else I normally go — so I haul it into the corridor to the left of the bar entrance and drag it up the stairs, which smell like beer and sweat. At the top is a small foyer. One door is labeled 14R and has a sign on the front: READINGS BY SERENITY.

The foyer walls are covered with peeling velveteen wallpaper. Yellow stains bloom on the ceiling, and it smells like too much potpourri. There’s a rickety side table propped up on a phone book for balance. On it is a china dish filled with business cards: SERENITY JONES, PSYCHIC.

There’s not much room for me and a bike in the little foyer. I jostle it in a stilted half circle, trying to lean it against the wall.

I can hear the muffled voices of two women on the other side of the interior door. I’m not sure if I’m supposed to knock, to tell Serenity I’m here. Then I realize that if she is any good at her job, she must already know."
B077TST3VT0,B077TST3VT,"The harder he sucked, the more his lungs shrivelled. Something engulfed his face, something filling his entire mouth and nostrils and threatening to invade his insides. He tried to move, but couldn't feel himself—couldn't imagine any of his limbs. The feeling was not unlike a dream—a detachment from one's self. But it was not a dream.

It was a nightmare.

His lungs burned, and his mouth and nostrils stretched against the foul substance compacting inside of them. No light, nor sound, would come—only suffocation and oblivion. His mind turned to Sophie, his beautiful wife, her throat torn apart by a shovel. What the hell had happened? What was happening now? All he knew was that it had started with divorce. All the bad things in his life led back to it. What had happened to the future? Houses, cars, holidays — they were supposed to have it all, and enjoy it together. That was why they'd started an accountancy firm—to be together in both work and play. Now he was alone and dying in the dark. Maybe dead already.

How did this happen? Help me. Please help me, God, so that I may help Sophie. She needs me. She is hurt. God, are you there?"
B077TST3VT1,B077TST3VT,"Because her first instinct had been to avoid the wreck at the side of the bridge, Gwen yanked her fuzzy pink steering wheel towards the centre of the bridge. The oncoming truck head-butted her little car right in the centre of its passenger door and sent Stacey sprawling into her. Her friend screamed as blood gushed from her glass-covered face, and in the backseat, Mia called out for her mom. Gwen did nothing but hold onto the wheel for dear life.

Her car entered another spin, the massive impact redirecting it back towards the crumpled saloon perched on the side of the bridge. In the corner of her eye, Gwen saw the truck cartwheel over the opposite side of the bridge—part of her thought it was justice for slamming into her.

The last thing she saw was the driver of the saloon leaning over and shaking a woman in the passenger seat. He didn't even notice her car skidding towards his at first, but even if he had, there was nothing he could have done. The nose of her car struck the saloon square in its rump, and what followed was a feeling of weightlessness that seemed to go on forever.

Gwen wondered if she was dead.

B01EVRUUMU0,B01EVRUUMU,"There were moments when she couldn’t see the hand in front of her face and, of course, the lane is potholed to hell. The moon helped. Drifted out from behind those clouds long enough to light her way to the picket fence, to the gate. It was easy to sneak across the front of the cottage then. The back was more difficult – those flower pots no more than shadowy trolls on the mossy paving stones and the lawn reaching away into the blackness of an abyss. That got to her all right, but she didn’t make a sound. She knew when she planned this that everything would have to be done in total silence. She is an impostor, you see. This is not her home. These are not her flickering walls. This is not her life.

FOUR

In my cottage, the kitchen continues around to what I’ve always called the secret back door, making a kind of horseshoe. By the time I’d hung my coat up and stepped further inside, the secret back door was clattering against the outside wall. I stepped out and made my way to the patio at the back.

Valentina was a couple of metres away, twirling around in the vast grassy space like Julie Andrews at the beginning of The Sound of Music."
B01EVRUUMU1,B01EVRUUMU,"He came home with me and stayed, stayed again and never quite left. We never stopped talking, except when we were eating supper in front of a movie or all over one another in bed. There were nights he had to sleep in Edinburgh – he had to sit his finals and of course the train fares were expensive – but then in the summer he got a bar job in Glasgow. He told me he wanted to chill for a bit, didn’t want rush into a career. But I know he got that job for me. No one can take that away from me, not even now. And when he told me his parents had bought a flat for him, did I want to move in, I said yes please, which is up there with telling Martin Amis you’re his number one fan. But I didn’t care.

Joy made me careless.

Valentina suggested we go for coffee in my car as hers was at the garage for repairs. Sure, I said. No problem. Before we moved north, Mikey had traded in the Golf for a second-hand Cherokee Jeep. For practical reasons, he’d said, though I suspected he secretly fancied himself in it – as a country squire or some such nonsense."
B003O86Q8U0,B003O86Q8U,"If the spy was right, then Lee would have to turn, but the old man did not believe in spies nor in any information you had to pay for, had not approved of the money spent or even the idea behind it. And the old man had faith in Stuart, and why in God’s name had Stuart sent nothing, not even a courier, because even Stuart wasn’t fool enough to let the whole damned Army of the Potomac get this close without word, not one damned lonesome word. Longstreet went back out into the light. He had never believed in this invasion. Lee and Davis together had overruled him. He did not believe in offensive warfare when the enemy outnumbered you and outgunned you and would come looking for you anyway if you waited somewhere on your own ground. He had not argued since leaving home, but the invasion did not sit right in his craw; the whole scheme lay edgewise and raspy in his brain, and treading here on alien ground, he felt a cold wind blowing, a distant alarm. Only instinct. No facts as yet. The spy reminded him about the cigar. It was a short way through the night to Lee’s headquarters, and they rode past low sputtering campfires with the spy puffing exuberant blue smoke like a happy furnace."
B003O86Q8U1,B003O86Q8U,"He was not safe even now, but he could begin to relax. He rode up the long road between picket fires, and he could hear them singing in the rain, chasing each other in the dark of the trees. A fat and happy army, roasting meat and fresh bread, telling stories in the dark. He began to fall asleep on the horse; he was home. But they did not like to see him sleep, and one of them woke him up to remind him, cheerily, that if there was no one up there who knew him, why, then, unfortunately, they’d have to hang him, and the soldier said it just to see the look on his face, and the spy shivered, wondering, Why do there have to be men like that, men who enjoy another man’s dying?

—

Longstreet was not asleep. He lay on the cot watching the lightning flare in the door of the tent. It was very quiet in the grove and there was the sound of the raindrops continuing to fall from the trees although the rain had ended. When Sorrel touched him on the arm he was glad of it; he was thinking of his dead children."
B003XT60E00,B003XT60E0,"That thing costed me two hundred dollars, he said.

You give two hundred dollars for it?

I did, for that was the price they put on the black son of a bitch it hung inside of.

He stirred about in the corner and came up with an old dark brass kettle, lifted the cover and poked inside with one finger. The remains of one of the lank prairie hares interred in cold grease and furred with a light blue mold. He clamped the lid back on the kettle and set it in the flames. Aint much but we’ll go shares, he said.

I thank ye.

Lost ye way in the dark, said the old man. He stirred the fire, standing slender tusks of bone up out of the ashes.

The kid didnt answer.

The old man swung his head back and forth. The way of the transgressor is hard. God made this world, but he didnt make it to suit everbody, did he?

I dont believe he much had me in mind.

Aye, said the old man. But where does a man come by his notions. What world’s he seen that he liked better?

I can think of better places and better ways."
B003XT60E01,B003XT60E0,"How long you been out here?

Out where?

The kid was sitting on his blanketroll across the fire from the old man. Here, he said. In this place.

The old man didnt answer. He turned his head suddenly aside and seized his nose between his thumb and forefinger and blew twin strings of snot onto the floor and wiped his fingers on the seam of his jeans. I come from Mississippi. I was a slaver, dont care to tell it. Made good money. I never did get caught. Just got sick of it. Sick of niggers. Wait till I show ye somethin.

He turned and rummaged among the hides and handed through the flames a small dark thing. The kid turned it in his hand. Some man’s heart, dried and blackened. He passed it back and the old man cradled it in his palm as if he’d weigh it.

They is four things that can destroy the earth, he said. Women, whiskey, money, and niggers.

They sat in silence. The wind moaned in the section of stovepipe that was run through the roof above them to quit the place of smoke. After a while the old man put the heart away."
B076ZX884S0,B076ZX884S,"For a while now, Ed had known that his life was stagnating. That no matter how hard he tried to move forward, he was stuck thanks to forces—to people—outside his control.

The teachers that demanded he solve a problem their way, even if he knew another, fastest one. Or the ones who favored the students that sucked up to them.

His boss at his former IT job who got promoted instead of better-suited options because he was golf-buddies with an executive.

Ryan, who enjoyed the benefits of his parents’ business and used it to make the lives of others miserable.

I’m trapped, Ed realized, with his hands curled into fists. If he said no to Murmur’s Gambit, it would be like admitting he, Ed, could become just like the people he despised if he were to be in their shoes.

It would mean turning his back on everything he believed in.

Kharon would return him to a jail cell where not only would he lose his freedom, but he would spend the rest of his life knowing he had failed himself.

And Kharon knew it.

Given the severity of his wounds, the body was still inside the funerary clinic. Nine-year-old Ed had let go of his father’s hand and had wandered off on his own through the corridors of the place, letting his curiosity roam free. He had gone beyond the modest chapels and beyond the clerk’s desk, beyond the heated furnaces of the crematorium, until he had reached a place with an AC unit spewing a current of cold air. He recalled the metal tables and the men in clinical attire working on the mangled body of his uncle—an amorphous black and pink blob in the mist of Ed’s memory—with rows and rows of tools and chemicals strewn around them in shelves and containers of all sizes. Little Ed had started screaming by then, which had scared the living hell out of the adults there. An elbow had pushed one container and it had shattered against the floor—which was strewn with drains for the corpses’ fluids—and the smell had been overpowering. It had made little Ed’s nose hurt and burn and it had smelled

B01N3JKY1D0,B01N3JKY1D,", it’s just that leaving the house feels like more trouble than it’s worth.

If I could ask the entire world one question, it would be: Why does it seem like people hate moms so much? Before anyone could accuse me of overreacting, I’d point out my first piece of evidence: the size of parking spots. Last time I was at the grocery store, as I squeezed my eight-months-postpartum body between millimeters of steel like a human panini, I had to wonder whether whoever paints those lines either...

Has never seen a human family before.

—or—

Despises mothers with the heat of a thousand diaper rashes.

How hard would it be to paint the white lines two inches farther apart? Would these mom-hater paint despots rather we go around scraping their BMW two-seaters with our minivan doors?

Is it deliberate fat shaming? Yes, I’ve only lost seven pounds of baby weight (which is weird, because the baby weighed eight pounds, two ounces), but we can’t all be celebrity moms who go straight from hospital gowns to string bikinis.

And unlike those magical Hollywood moms, I didn’t have a personal chef on call to make me macrobiotic, paleo, organic, fat-free, sugar-free, carb-free (taste-free?) meals every day."
B01N3JKY1D1,B01N3JKY1D,"It’s not that I think formula is evil; I just always pictured myself breastfeeding under a willow at the park, its leaves gently swaying in the warm breeze, onlookers stealing admiring glances at me. Ask me how many admiring glances I get whipping out a nine-ounce bottle at Starbucks. ZERO. One mom even asked—with tears in her eyes, no less—if she could breastfeed my baby for me. As if Aubrey is some malnourished third-world baby on television with flies buzzing around her emaciated body. I may have lied and said that she’s allergic to human milk.

Oh, and we stopped using the million-dollar-a-can organic formula blend when Aubrey was three months old. Now she’s on the cheap brand stuff. She’s the only eight-month-old I know with zero teeth —probably from all of the trace minerals she’s missing from my malfunctioning mammary glands. Formula. When she drops out of community college, we’ll all know why.

Yesterday, Emily Walker posted a photo of herself breastfeeding her eighteen-month-old in front of the Eiffel Tower. She’s doing her show live from Paris for her Motherhood Better book tour, and I’m sitting in funky pajamas trying to remember the last time I shaved my armpits.

Back to the lessons I learned today."
B01N1U8J3T0,B01N1U8J3T,"Julia’s success is not contingent upon special attention or upon therapeutic intervention. It’s not so complicated. Her schoolwork is boring. We live in exciting and terrible times. The world is at war in the Middle East. Atmospheric carbon approaches four hundred ppm. We are in the middle of the sixth great extinction. In the next decade, we will be over Hubbert’s Peak. We may be over it even now, or we may continue with the present course of fracking, which represents a different but no less serious risk to the water table. And for all your efforts, our children might as well believe their tap water arrives by magic. They do not know that there is an aquifer beneath their town, or that it is dangerously depleted, or that we have no plan for how to supply the town with water after its depletion. Most of them do not know that five of the last six years have been the hottest on record. I imagine that your students might be interested in that. I imagine they might be interested in their future. Instead, my child is taking spelling tests. In eighth grade. Are you puzzled that her mind is elsewhere?"

The shell rolls a broad arc with a marbly sound. He wets a finger and turns the page. She stands waiting for him to look up at her, but he does not look up, and she thinks, is this all? She goes upstairs to her room, dark with unvarnished wood paneling, the creepers of poison oak reaching through the sashes and the frame of the western window.

That night Turtle waits on her plywood platform, under the green military sleeping bag and wool blankets, listening to the rats gnawing on the dirty dishes in the kitchen. Sometimes she can hear the clack clack clack of a rat squatting on a stack of plates and scratching its neck. She can hear Martin pace from room to room. On wall pegs, her Lewis Machine & Tool AR-10, her Noveske AR-15, and her Remington 870 twelve-gauge pump-action shotgun. Each answers a different philosophy of use. Her clothes are folded carefully on her shelves, her socks stowed in a steamer trunk at the foot of the bed."
B01N5GV31V0,B01N5GV31V,"Yung followed as they were taken down into what felt like the bottom of the ship, to a cargo hold that smelled of coal dust and stale urine. And there was a constant mechanical thrum coming through the walls that he could feel as well as hear.

As his eyes adjusted to the dimly lit space, Yung could see that the cargo hold had been converted into a living quarters, divided into racks of bunks and rows of low-walled pens, with woolen blankets and straw mattresses. He was assigned to a pen with five other boys, who looked at him warily. A group of peasant girls, some with bound feet, perhaps eight or nine years of age, were put in pens directly across from them, while the teenagers in silk cheongsams and lacy European dresses, with high necks and tight collars, were put in a locked wooden paddock toward the rear of the room. The iron bars suggested the place had previously been used for storing precious cargo. Yung watched the sailors regard the comely girls the way his mother and he used to hungrily stare at street vendors cooking fresh siu mei. That’s when Yung realized the well-dressed girls had been locked away for their own protection."
B01N5GV31V1,B01N5GV31V,"Yung overheard the sailors chattering back and forth in Chinese, Portuguese, and English, which he understood just enough to gather that they were blackbirders.

His mother had once talked about these men—sailors who sold poor Chinese to plantations in Hawaii, outlaws who smuggled workers into the western world, and brokers who delivered brides to lonely men in the gold mountains of Gum Shan—the rich and mysterious frontiers of North America.

Despite those warnings, Yung’s heart quickened as he began to smell real food—roast chicken, garlic, and other savory spices, emanating from the ship, wafting on the breeze.

The officer yelled boarding instructions, and Yung was ushered onboard with his tiny knapsack of clothing. He could see another gangplank leading up to the front of the ship, where the man who was not his uncle had donned a coat and top hat and was hosting elegantly dressed men and women, Asian and Anglo, on a forward deck. There were men in military uniforms and a host of Chinese officials. Yung stared, his mouth watering as he watched them eat, and drink wine from long-stemmed glasses. He and the other children and teens were herded below, through narrow hallways, past crew cabins, and beyond rows of bunks crowded with shirtless Chinese sailors who sported brands on their chests and scars on their backs."
B07B3RRHPX0,B07B3RRHPX,"She should have been glad to be home, away from him, but somehow she still felt as though he was with her, even though she’d left him behind in a high rise across town. Stalking around the room, she tidied this and moved that, making her place look nice. Of course, it already looked nice, and technically it wasn’t really her place. Like everything else, it belonged to the family. She was a tenant in her own life, just like Aiden had been before he was evicted.

Stressed and frustrated, she turned her phone back on. Aiden would probably be in touch soon. When her phone came back online, there wasn’t any message from Aiden, but there was one from that not so unknown number: CALL ME, ELLIE. WE NEED TO TALK.

All caps. A demand from a man who now thought he could order her around just because she’d spent five minutes talking to him.

How the hell did he have her number? She didn’t remember giving it to him. She’d been too mad to wonder about that while she was driving, but now she was worried. He’d said he knew more about Aiden than she did. How much did he really know?

Before she could puzzle that out, her mother rang. Elliot answered."
B07B3RRHPX1,B07B3RRHPX,"Mason used to stick out like a sore thumb in their lavishly decorated home.

It hadn’t been his fault, she supposed. Mason’s family was poor. His father had died when he was young and he had been raised by his mother. Even back then though, he’d had a certain confidence that transcended his poverty. He was smart, attending the same school as Aiden by merit of scholarships. From the moment they met, he and Aiden had become best friends, and most of the way through school, he’d worn Aiden’s uniforms second hand.

She’d been the little sister to them both, and he’d treated her like a snot-nosed brat. She’d been a princess to everyone else, but never to him. The one thing she’d always had on her side was that she was rich and he was not — but now he owned half the city. It had been inevitable, people who’d known him back then said. He’d always been such a smart boy. She hoped he was still smart enough to help.

Stepping out of the elevator, Elliot made her way through frosted glass doors that bore his logo. She was greeted by a receptionist, a matronly woman who gave her a cool, appraising look."
B00CX5BYD20,B00CX5BYD2,"When the magic touched the inside of the mechanism, I felt it as if I were using my own finger. It’s a matter of remembering where each part was so that I could construct the key and turn it. One wrong move and I’d have to start from scratch, and it’s not something that I could do in a hurry. The more complex the lock, the more of a pain in the arse it is to use magic to open it.

The lock on the penthouse was one of the more secure locks that I’d ever had to pick. The main problem was that you had to turn the key once to make it click, move the key back to its original position and then do it again, but this time the click came further away. It took me ten minutes to get the lock open. I certainly would have been happier kicking the door in.

The second the door closed behind me, a continuous beep sounded from an alarm panel on the wall next to me. I punched in the six digits and the beeping ended. That had been my major worry: What if Neil had changed the code and not told anyone? Turns out, I needn’t have been concerned."
B00CX5BYD21,B00CX5BYD2,"I mumbled something under my breath and placed my palm against the door’s lock. White glyphs cascaded from my fingers, across the back of my hands, and down over my wrists and forearms, vanishing beneath the sleeve of my hoodie, where they would continue up my arms and across my chest and back.

Magic is a complicated beast. For the most part, you think about what you want to do, and, if you’re powerful and experienced enough, the magic will form on those thoughts. Magic wants to be used, to flow freely from the sorcerer, no matter how dangerous that might be. In contrast, the actual control of magic is very difficult. Even the smaller uses of magic, like lighting a candle, require precise movements and power, so that you’re not left with a big puddle of wax and a lot of fires to put out.

That’s why young sorcerers are so dangerous— they don’t have the control needed to temper their magic and have, on occasion, caused devastation when their power has exceeded their ability.

Using air magic to fill the inside of a lock in the exact same way as a key was both time consuming and tiring."
B01N4NGE140,B01N4NGE14,"Outside, it was fully dark and completely silent. Steven was groggy and struggled to walk straight, so Keith and Rick grabbed an arm each and marched him across the car park as fast as they could. As they did so, Rick kept picturing Sarah’s face. There one minute; snapped around and facing the wrong way the next.

Dead men walked the Earth, killing the living.

The apocalypse had arrived.

As Rick dared to glance backwards one last time, he saw the black haired corpse strolling after them casually, apparently, in no hurry.

~Mina Magar~

Mayfair, England

It was like walking through a movie set for the grizzliest film ever made. The dead littered the roads like rubbish, their blood the ancient city’s latest graffiti. Tens of thousands dead. Mina made the assumption simply by extrapolating from what she saw on every street. Now and then, amongst the dead men, women, and children, she or David would spot a body that wasn’t human. One laid in front of her now—a charred creature with clumps of flesh between its crooked teeth. Somebody had fought back and run it through with a skiing pole. The price tag still hung from the rubber grip."
B01N4NGE141,B01N4NGE14,"For that, they will thank us for the rest of their lives. You probably think that earns you the right to disembark this ship and go searching for your families. Perhaps it does. Yet, I ask you to think carefully, because the moment you step off this ship, you cease being heroes at a time when the world needs heroes more than ever. As long as people are in need of help, it is our duty to stay aboard this ship and do what we signed up to do. Something terrible happened today, and our country is relying on us to minimise the damage. If we fail to protect our homeland, then what do our families even have left to live for? America is a country forged by brave men and women. The moment we stop fighting for our freedom is the moment we lose it. I, too, have a family, but I will remain aboard the Hatchet and do my duty. I ask you to do the same. We are heading to Norfolk, and there we will rearm and refuel. What will happen beyond that, I do not know, but I suggest that those of you that pray do so now. Pray for us all."
B000FBFNT20,B000FBFNT2,"She popped a frozen waffle into the toaster. While it was warming, she looked around the kitchen for more dirty dishes—

And saw the place through her sister’s eyes.

It wasn’t a bad house, certainly not by Hayden standards. Small, yes: three tiny bedrooms tucked into the peaked second floor; a single bathroom on each floor; a living room; and a kitchen with an eating space that doubled as a counter. In the six years Claire had lived here, she’d painted the once moss-green walls a creamy French vanilla and replaced the orange shag carpeting with hardwood floors. Her furniture, although mostly secondhand, was all framed in wood that she’d stripped and refinished herself. Her pride and joy was a Hawaiian koa-wood love seat. It didn’t look like much in the living room, with its faded red cushions, but someday, when she lived on Kauai, it would stop people in their tracks.

Meg would see it differently, of course. Meg, who’d graduated high school early and then breezed through seven years of college, who never failed to mention that she had buckets of money, and had the nerve to send her niece Christmas gifts that made the others under the tree look paltry by comparison."
B000FBFNT21,B000FBFNT2,"He stared at the distant fields, wishing he were walking along the wide rows between the trees, smelling the sweet scent of rich earth and growing fruit.

There might be a breeze down there; even a breath of one would alleviate this stifling heat. Here, there was only the hot sun, beating down on the metal warehouse. Perspiration sheened his forehead and dampened the skin beneath his T-shirt.

The heat was getting to him and it was only the second week of June. There was no way he could handle summer in the Yakima Valley. It was time to move on again.

The realization exhausted him.

Not for the first time, he wondered how much longer he could do this, drift from town to town. Loneliness was wearing him down, whittling him away to a stringy shadow; unfortunately, the alternative was worse.

Once— it felt long ago now—he’d hoped that one of these places would feel right, that he’d come into some town, think, This is it, and dare to rent an apartment instead of a seedy motel room.

He no longer harbored such dreams. He knew better. After a week in the same room, he started to feel things, remember things. The nightmares would start. The only protection he had found was strangeness."
B072HLLTF60,B072HLLTF6,"I felt its legs sway under me in confusion as the magic powering its undead brain simply couldn’t comprehend what exactly was happening to it. Maintaining my grip, I leaned backwards, letting the zombie’s weight tip me over as I arched my back.

Leading the creature straight over my body, I completed the lethal suplex with an earthshattering crunch and an explosion of gore as its head smashed into the ground.

Twisting my body, I allowed the once again lifeless corpse of the ogre to fall to the side. Wasting no time, I launched myself up to my feet, grabbing my fallen sword as I stood and scanned the room for Cayden. I spotted the dwarf a short distance away, staring at me with a completely terrified expression. I shot forward and swung the blade in a vicious arc with every single ounce of rage-filled strength I possessed.

Eyes widening at my sudden attack, Cayden thrust his arm out, desperately trying to conjure yet another force shield in an attempt to block my sword.

This time, however, he was just too slow.

Catching him before the spell could fully form, my sword sliced straight through the jaundiced dwarf ’s wrist, sending his hand falling uselessly to the floor. A spurt of blood gushed from the stump as Cayden pulled it to his chest."
B072HLLTF61,B072HLLTF6,"I felt the rage well up inside me as I activated the sigil once again and embraced the torrent of energy that surged through my body —I’m going to take the house down with me!

Charged with a newfound strength, I thrashed in the ogre ’s grip, fighting against its unholy strength as I tried to free myself. Surprised by my sudden increase in strength, the zombie’s grip slipped, allowing me a chance to catch a single, glorious, rot-filled breath of air. Revitalized, I used the opportunity to attack the creature, digging my hands deep into its abdomen, ripping and tearing at everything I could find.

Bloated and rotting intestines fell on the ground as I tore through the zombie’s soft stomach, rending a massive hole in its gut. I heard Cayden shouting something that my rage-filled state couldn’t comprehend, focused entirely on disemboweling the zombie. Liquid fire coursed through my veins as I ripped chunks of flesh from the zombie’s body, barely feeling the creature regain its grip around me.

As I dug through the zombie’s insides, I felt my fingers hit its hip bone and immediately forced them even deeper, a desperate and daring plan forming in my mind.

Grabbing the bone firmly, I began to pull upwards, gradually lifting the hulking zombie off the ground."
B0176M3UJW0,B0176M3UJW,"There’s the CVS with the group of teenage boys loitering at the side of the lot, like Charlie Higgins used to do. There’s the strip of stores, different letters stenciled in the windows from when I was a kid, except for Kelly’s Pub, which was as close to a landmark as we had. There’s the elementary school and, across the street, the police station, with Corinne’s case file stored in some back closet, gathering dust. I imagined all the evidence boxed away and tucked in a corner, because there was no place else to put her. Lost in the shuffle, forgotten with time.

The electrical cables strung above us on the roadside, the church that most everyone went to, whether you were Protestant or not. And beside it, the cemetery. Corinne used to make us hold our breath as we drove past. Hands on the ceiling over the railroad tracks, a kiss when the church bells chimed twelve, and no breathing around the dead. She made us do it even after my mother died. Like death was a superstition, something we could outwit by throwing salt over our shoulders, crossing our fingers behind our backs.

I took my phone out at the stoplight and called Everett. I got his voicemail, like I knew I would."
B0176M3UJW1,B0176M3UJW,"Maybe it was because of the humidity and the way we had to fight our way through it, like syrup sticking to the bottom of our feet, sweet and viscous. Maybe it was from living so close to the mountains—a thousand years in the making, the slow shift of plates under the earth, the trees that have been here since I was born and would be here when I was gone.

Maybe it’s the fact that you can’t see anything beyond here when you’re in it. Just mountains and forest and you. That’s it.

One decade later, a hundred miles away, and I cross the state line — Welcome to North Carolina!—and the trees grow thicker, and the air goes heavy, and I’m back.

The blurred edges shifting back into focus, my own mind resettling, remembering. The ghosts of us gaining substance: Corinne running down the side of the road in front of me, holding out her thumb, her legs shiny from sweat, her skirt blowing up when a car passes too close. Bailey hanging off my shoulder, her breath hot with vodka. Or maybe that was mine.

My fingers uncurled from the wheel. I wanted to reach out and touch them."

The one new face in the room was also the lone female. Suzanne Brewer was a thirty-nine-year-old Programs and Plans officer for the National Clandestine Service. She spent her days at CIA identifying and fortifying soft spots in Agency security protocols. She knew the name of every potential agent provocateur; she knew the details of threats against CIA personnel, every known operation targeting the Agency, every website that posted warnings to life and limb of intelligence officers all over the District. She wasn’t a spy herself, but she saw it as her mission to keep the spies of NCS safe from harm.

Denny Carmichael marched in at eleven forty-five p.m., his brow pinched with purpose. DeRenzi was with him, and as Denny moved to his chair, his close protection officer took a position against the wall, present for the meeting in an observer capacity only. It was his job to keep his protectee safe from harm, after all.

Denny dropped into his seat at the head of the conference table, facing the large monitors on the opposite wall. He turned first to Brewer."

—

Ten minutes later five men and one woman converged in a glass-walled conference room that could easily accommodate sixteen, took their seats quickly, and then all eyes turned to a pair of side-by-side monitors on the wall. A satellite linkup had been established with Tel Aviv and fed to one of the monitors, but until the commo people on the Israeli side of the connection gave the word that their attendee was on camera and ready, the screen just glowed blue. Next to this, a larger screen displayed an interactive map of the greater Washington, D.C., area.

The responsibilities of those in the room represented some of the most secret departments and divisions within the CIA. Communications was there, as were the CIA employees charged with working with the National Security Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the Joint Special Operations Command, the military’s most elite paramilitary fighting force. A CIA analyst sat across from a senior officer in the Department of Science and Technology. Jordan Mayes, assistant director of the National Clandestine Service, entered and sat to the left of the empty chair at the head of the table.

Most of these officers had been on the Violator Working Group for years. It had taken them, both physically and virtually, to locations all over the world."
B01MYMHKZ40,B01MYMHKZ4,"Frederick had two daughters: Elena, who was seventeen, a year younger than Kristoff, and who reminded Kristoff of the edelweiss with her snowy skin, waves of long light brown hair, and bright green eyes. And Miriam, who was thirteen. If Elena was a flower, then Miriam was the buzzing bee who wouldn’t leave the flower alone. Or, as Mrs. Faber called her with an exasperated roll of her green eyes, a flibbertigibbet. But Kristoff still found her amusing, even when her family did not.

Kristoff quickly became accustomed to life in Grotsburg, where the world was green and very quiet, and instead of buildings and throngs of people, he woke up each morning to a view of the forest and rolling hills. But even more, Kristoff reveled in the warmth of the Fabers’ dining room, of the fragrant smell of Mrs. Faber’s stews, of the bread they broke on Friday nights in the glow of their candles. The challah was a savory bread, and Kristoff had never tasted anything like it growing up in the orphanage in Vienna, where the nuns had led him to believe there was only one religion anyway. Not that he was necessarily a believer. Kristoff was much more drawn to the Fabers, the light and wholeness of their family, than he had ever been to God or the institutional church."
B01MYMHKZ41,B01MYMHKZ4,"But most important, the opportunity to learn the trade that Frederick Faber was known for throughout Austria: engraving. His greatest creation was the country’s most popular — and, Kristoff would argue, artistically perfect—postage stamp, the 12 Groschen Edelweiss. The stamp was a stunning replica of the pure white flower, and Frederick had both designed and engraved it himself in 1932.

Kristoff remembered placing that stamp on a letter he’d written to his mother once, but had never sent. He could not mail a letter to someone who didn’t exist, or whose existence and location he could never determine in spite of his best efforts. But even as a young boy of thirteen, Kristoff had admired the artistry of that stamp, the perfect bows of the petals. He’d always wanted to make a living as an artist. So when he’d heard the rumor last fall from another street artist in Vienna, that Frederick Faber, the Frederick Faber, was searching for a new apprentice, Kristoff had packed up his art supplies and spent most of his small savings to hire a ride to take him the two hundred kilometers out to Grotsburg. And when he’d arrived, he’d convinced Frederick to give him the job after he showed Frederick some of his charcoal sketches of Vienna."
B07BJ8D2330,B07BJ8D233,"Gemma Fordham was wearing her usual trouser suit and upmarket trainers; maybe not the usual outfit for a DS, but her training in martial arts let her get away with it. With her short crop of white-blonde hair and damaged, husky, sexy voice, she was, he knew, many a copper ’s — and a villain ’s — secret fantasy.

Beside her, working diligently on the computer, was the red-haired Keith Barrington, who was the first to spot him coming.

The new man, Mark Chang, dark, too good-looking not to be in films or on the telly, was talking on the phone. He seemed to be doing OK, so far. One thing was for sure — he couldn’t do worse than Frank Ross, the man he’d replaced. Ross had been the last of Ronnie Greene’s corrupt cronies still on the force and, ironically enough, on Hillary Greene’s team, before he and Hillary had all but forced him into retirement.

But it was to Hillary herself that he gravitated. He knew she’d visited Janine Mallow that morning and, in other circumstances, would have taken a few moments to ask how she was. Public opinion about Janine might be fickle and flow first one way then another, but amongst her own she demanded loyalty and respect. As did Hillary Greene for standing by her."
B07BJ8D2331,B07BJ8D233,"But he’d hung in stubbornly, and not even her short-lived affair with an officer from the Vice squad in St Aldates had put him off his dogged pursuit of her. He’d always believed that if he could just keep going, he’d eventually wear her down.

He wasn’t sure if it was the fact that she was a few years older than him or that he was now her boss that made her reluctant to take him up on his subtle offer. He’d even considered transferring out of HQ to maybe Banbury or even Swindon, but he wasn’t confident enough that even that would improve his chances with her.

But then something had happened recently, serious enough that even Danvers couldn’t ignore it. And for the last few weeks he’d been wrestling with the consequences of it before finally arriving at a decision that had the dubious merit of being sensible. Even clever. Even so, admitting defeat wasn’t coming easy.

He knew he’d have to take the ultimate step soon, but he kept putting it off and putting it off. The interruption of the telephone made him sigh angrily, but, as he listened to the voice on the other end of the line, he sat up a little straighter in his chair."
B007OLQD8G0,B007OLQD8G,"Take, for example, the famous description of Jim’s hangover:

He lay sprawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse. His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he’d somehow been on a cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad.

An elaborate literary metaphor is followed by intimations of, among other things, ancient archaeology and modern totalitarianism in the description of what is, after all, a historic hangover, beautifully setting off the banal everyday conclusion. Here, as elsewhere in the book, handling of the different registers is not only full of energy but pitch-perfect.

Jim’s fundamental scrupulousness, his inability to say what he does not mean (at least not without making a horrible face), allows him, little by little, to involve other people in his minor acts of sabotage, to forge alliances."
B007OLQD8G1,B007OLQD8G,"The recipient of this letter, Philip Larkin, wasn’t feeling so great himself. The same age as Amis, he was at this point the more accomplished man of letters, having already published a book of poems and two novels. He was also more secure professionally: Partly out of desperation, partly out of inclination, he had embarked on a career as a university librarian. But Larkin had trouble with women. He had trouble meeting them; he had trouble seducing them. He wasn’t even sure that he liked them. What made matters worse, at least from his friend Kingsley’s point of view, was that Larkin’s inability to meet women was superseded only by his inability, once having met them, to disentangle himself. He seemed to combine hidden hostility with an exaggerated scrupulosity. He lost his virginity at the age of twenty-three and proceeded to get engaged to the young woman who had taken it. His next major affair, begun in the late 1940s, was with Monica Jones, a lecturer in the English department at the University of Leicester, where Larkin was a librarian, and it would last, with some hiccups, for the rest of Larkin’s life.

Amis and Larkin had met as first years at Oxford in 1941 and quickly become good friends."
B07119HN320,B07119HN32,"The dinner would be attended by Bunny, Becca, Lucas, fruit date, Kit and Stacey, and Harper, so seven.

She handed Lucas the tablecloth before digging out seven dark green place mats. The rest was easy: seven gold chargers, seven sets of gold flatware, her favorite crystal glasses, white plates. She had a collection of salad plates in different patterns, including eight that were edged in gold. She would make custom napkin rings by dressing up plain ones with clusters of silk flowers. She had three hurricane lamps with gold bases.

She left him to put the linens on the table, then hurried into her craft room to double-check supplies. Honestly, she should have planned her table a couple of days ago, in case she needed to go to the craft store. Now she was going to have to wing it.

She plugged in her glue gun, then dug through a large bag of silk flower pieces and found several tiny pink blossoms, along with some greens. She had glass beads, of course, and plenty of ribbon. Ten minutes later, she had secured the last of the flowers to the clear plastic napkin rings she bought in bulk. She picked up bags of colored glass beads and the ribbon, then turned and nearly ran into Lucas."
B07119HN321,B07119HN32,"—now she would certainly be qualified to work in an office, only to find she didn’t want to. She liked making her own hours and being around for her daughter— not that Becca was especially interested in her mother these days, but still. Harper was here should her daughter ever want or need her.

Harper went into the kitchen and poured herself another cup of coffee. The back door opened and Harper’s mother walked in. Bunny Bloom was petite, slim and in her early sixties. She dressed in high-end knits, wore her dark hair short and spikey and always, always put on makeup before stepping outside her apartment.

Bunny had lost her husband a couple of years ago and while Harper had been a mess in the months following her father’s death, Bunny had soldiered on, taking care of what needed doing. Once the dust had settled, she’d moved into the apartment above Harper’s garage both to be close to her only grandchild and to help Harper financially. There were months when Bunny’s thousand-dollar rent check meant the difference between hamburger for dinner and a box of mac and cheese. Figuratively, Harper thought as she smiled at her mother. She would never use boxed mac and cheese. She would make it herself, from scratch, including the noodles."
B074MLD2Z60,B074MLD2Z6,"He was glowing too and the glow had attracted something from the mists.

The creature was hidden and indistinct. Tau could see enough though. It moved in a lurching run on two feet, its balance aided by club-like hands on arms so long they could touch the ground when the thing was upright. It had a flat face, red eyes, a slavering mouth, and its skin seemed diseased.

The monster caught Tau in its crimson gaze and roared. Tau couldn't make himself move and it came for him, careening out of the mists, reaching for him with its misshapen club-like hands. Tau's legs gave out, he opened his mouth to scream, and he fell and kept falling, through the ground and beyond.

Tau gasped, pulling in air and ash and the stench of blood. He was on his knees. It felt like his mind was on fire and fear, unlike anything he'd ever known, thundered through him. He felt warm wetness soak his trews. He'd soiled himself.

He didn't care, couldn't care. It was enough to stay on his knees and not collapse into the battle-churned muck. The Ihagu around him were similarly affected and Tau saw that many of the hedeni, the ones near the Enraged Ingonyama, were also down."
B074MLD2Z61,B074MLD2Z6,"Tau went into the ocean. He made it four strides and, with the water swirling around his knees, was swept off his feet and dragged out.

The Roar pulled him under, tossed him around, threatening to drown him. He only lived because it was low tide and the water, so close to the beach, was shallow. The other boys made a chain of arms to reach to him. They pulled him from the churning waves.

Being blasted by the Gifted felt like drowning in The Roar, only in deep water. It was as if Tau's body was being dashed to pieces while the world around him warped and spun and, when the spinning stopped, things got worse.

Tau saw Daba, but everything was different. The colors had been sucked away, leaving the hamlet, earth, and sky in shades of gray. An unnatural wind buffeted him, shrieking, burying the other sounds, while impenetrable mists obscured anything further than twenty strides away.

Tau could see what had to be the other Ihagu, the men who had been standing near him, but couldn't make sense of what he saw. The men, all in varying degrees of distress, were glowing with golden light. Tau looked down at himself."
B00RA7QOHY0,B00RA7QOHY,"Still covering their ears, they had to turn away and lean down to avoid being knocked over by the wind blast. The ship settled down onto four spring-loaded feet. The whooshing roar stopped almost immediately.

Tommy and Tatyana stood up, reluctantly uncovering their ears and wiping off the dust and debris that coated their clothing. They began walking through the short scrub-grass toward the hover ship. It was silent now except for the occasional ping and snap sounds, similar to what a car makes when turned off after a long drive. They arrived at the hover ship and waited for the main hatch door to open. They heard the noise of switches being flipped inside and the sound of a small fan turning on.

The handle on the door spun and the hatch opened. A tall, skinny man with a huge smile on his face looked out; sweat poured from his head. Keller was wearing, of all things, a business suit. He hopped out and landed super-hero style with one hand down in the dirt holding him up. He stood up and clapped his hands together to wipe off the dust. Keller stuck out his hand toward Tatyana in the gesture of a handshake."
B00RA7QOHY1,B00RA7QOHY,"After a few seconds he was high enough to see a little trailer on the other side of Saddleback Mountain.

Tatyana and Tommy heard what sounded like high-pressure air leaking from a bicycle inner tube. It was getting louder as they swiveled their heads around to locate the source. A sudden, high-pitched roaring made them drop their binoculars and cover their ears.

The prototype hover ship came racing over the trailer at nearly 100mph, tilted only slightly away from vertical. It was a white capsule with thin vertical blue stripes and large black X’s all over it used for camera tracking. The MM10 engines sprayed out what looked like high-speed steam. Tatyana thought the entire hover ship looked like the nose cone from any of the classic NASA moon rockets. The MM10 motors looked like long golden bells with two placed at each of the four corners.

As the ship slowed down, the control fins moved less, but the golden bell engines began moving more.

The ship circled back around, as deafening as ever, and came to a hover about twenty yards away from the trailer. It levitated there, motionless, several feet off the ground. It was an awesome sight that didn’t make sense to the brain. Things like that shouldn’t float."
B00316UMPS0,B00316UMPS,"Those girls had nearly spoiled him beyond redemption, and would have if Rachel hadn’t kept her eye out. She knew what was what, even if these young ones thought otherwise.

Things were different once, Rachel thought . . . and as she thought it the pine smell of the shaded garden seemed to catch at her heart. The castle had been such a beautiful, stirring place: tall knights, plumed and shiny-mailed, and beautiful girls in fine dresses, the music . . . oh, and the tourney field all jewel-bright with tents! Now the castle slept quietly, and only dreamed. The towering battlements were commanded by Rachel’s kind: by cooks and chambermaids, seneschals and scullions. . . .

• • •

It was a little chilly. Rachel leaned forward, hugging her shawl tighter, then straightened up staring. Simon stood before her, hands hidden behind his back. How on the earth had he managed to slip up on her that way? And why did he have that idiot grin smeared across his face? Rachel felt the strength of righteousness come surging back into her body. His shirt—clean an hour before—was blackened with dirt and torn in several places, as were his breeches."
B00316UMPS1,B00316UMPS,"The morning sun was just nosing over the battlement, peeping like a child.

She liked this spot, just underneath the stone span that connected the dining hall building with the main body of the chapel. The little courtyard in the shadow of the span was full of pine trees and heather, all set about on small, sloping hills; the whole garden was not more than a stone’s throw in length. Looking up past the stone walkway she could see the needle-slim thrust of Green Angel Tower, shining white in the sunlight like an ivory tusk.

There had been a time, Rachel remembered, long before Simon came, when she herself had been a girl playing in this garden. How some of those maids would laugh to think of that: the Dragon as a little girl. Well, she had been, and after that a young lady—not unpleasant to look at, either, and that was only the truth. The garden then had been full of the rustle of brocade and silk, of lords and ladies laughing, with hawks on their fists and a merry song on their lips.

Now Simon, he thought he knew everything — God just made young men stupid, and that was that."
B072KK9LYY0,B072KK9LYY,"Sometimes it was harmless, like a drunken night with his friends or waking up the next morning in the bed of a woman he’d never seen before.

However, every now and then, it would lead him into danger…and he could not afford that, especially tonight.

And yet, Tristan followed his friend inside, unable to return to the echo of an empty house, dark and full of ghosts of his past.

What he wanted most of all, what he dreamed of at night as well as during the day, was a family of his own. A wife who knew him at his best as well as at his worst and loved him all the same. A daughter he could spoil. A son he could take fishing.

A family he could call his own, who looked at him not with apprehension or disappointment, but with love instead.

Would he ever have a home?

Every day that dream seemed to slip farther and farther out of his grasp, and Tristan didn’t know what he could do to change that, nor did he think he had the strength.

Maybe it was a curse.

Maybe he was doomed to follow in his father’s footsteps.

Maybe he was exactly the kind of man his uncle believed him to be.

Maybe.

Chapter Five – Lady Adelaide"
B072KK9LYY1,B072KK9LYY,"Every night, she had come to hold him, stroking his head and whispering in his ear until he had fallen asleep.

Henrietta.

Again, Tristan’s heart ached, and he tried to remember how long it had been since he’d last seen her. It had been months if he recalled correctly, remembering the disappointment in her eyes as she had accused him of reckless behaviour, not unlike their uncle.

It had broken his heart to hear those words out of her mouth, and he had left that day and not returned.

And now it was too late.

Only a few weeks ago, he had received a letter from his uncle, informing him that they were headed to Scotland to see his sister married and that she asked him not to come.

Did she truly think of him as their uncle did? Had she not always stood by his side? Loved him no matter what? How had this happened?

Lifting his head, Tristan found himself outside of White’s and a frown settled on his face. How had he gotten here? He couldn’t even recall walking in this direction.

A shiver went down his back. Had it been the same for his father? Before he had lost his mind?"
B019C40Z7M0,B019C40Z7M,"Cal liked trouble. Teresa looked up at her husband, her fingers daubed in the baby’s blood, and asked him where Cal had gone.

All week long Cousins waded through the pimps and the wife-beaters, the petty thieves. He offered up his best self to biased judges and sleeping juries. He told himself that when the weekend came he would turn away from all the crime in Los Angeles, turn towards his pajama-clad children and newly pregnant wife, but he only made it to noon on Saturdays before telling Teresa that there was work at the office he had to finish before the first hearing on Monday. The funny thing was he really did go to work. The couple of times he’d tried slipping off to Manhattan Beach to eat a hot dog and flirt with the girls in their bikini tops and tiny cutoff shorts, he’d gotten a sunburn which Teresa was quick to comment on. So he would go to the office and sit among the men he sat among all week long. They would nod seriously to one another and accomplish more in three or four hours on a Saturday afternoon than they did on any other day."
B019C40Z7M1,B019C40Z7M,"They lunged at him again, shrieking with laughter, but he couldn’t play with them and he didn’t want to play with them and didn’t want to get up and get the baby, but he had to.

And so the day went from there, Teresa saying she needed to be able to go to the grocery store by herself, or that the people who lived on the corner were having a cookout and they hadn’t gone to the last cookout. Every minute a child was howling, first one at a time, then in duet, with the third one waiting, then the third one joining in, then two settling down so as to repeat the cycle. The baby fell straight into the sliding glass door in the den and cut open her forehead before breakfast. Teresa was on the floor, butterflying tiny Band-Aids, asking Bert if he thought she needed stitches. The sight of blood always made Bert uncomfortable and so he looked away, saying no, no stitches. Holly was crying because the baby was crying. Holly said that her head hurt. Cal was nowhere in evidence—though screaming, be it that of his sisters or his parents, usually brought him running back."
B000FCKIFU0,B000FCKIFU,"The Potomac River was also quiet tonight. The police boat that regularly patrolled the waters must have headed south toward the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. That was very good, Stone thought. Thankfully, he didn’t pass any police officers on land either. This was a free country, but somewhat less free for a man who lived in a cemetery, wore clothes only a couple of levels above rags and was out after dark in an affluent area.

Stone walked along the waterfront, skirted the Francis Scott Key Park, trudged under the Francis Scott Key Bridge and finally passed a memorial to the famous composer. A bit of overkill, Stone thought, for a fellow who had written song lyrics no one could remember. The sky was an inky black with splashes of clouds and dots of stars; and, with the recently reinstated curfew at nearby Reagan National Airport, there were no aircraft exhaust streams to mar its beauty. However, Stone could feel the thick ground fog rolling in. Soon, he would be lucky to see a foot in front of him. He was drawing near to a gaudily painted building owned by one of the local rowing clubs when a familiar voice called to him from the darkness."
B000FCKIFU1,B000FCKIFU,"That little tumble fractured Alex’s neck. After a number of operations and the insertion of some very fine stainless steel, his six-foot-three frame had been reduced by nearly a full inch, though his posture was much improved, since steel didn’t bend. Being a little shorter didn’t bother him nearly as much as the constant burn in his neck. He could’ve taken disability and left the Service, but that wasn’t the way he wanted to go out. Single and childless, he didn’t have any place to go to. So he’d sweated and pushed himself back into shape and gotten the blessing of the Secret Service medicos to return to the field after months on desk duty.

Right now, though, at age forty-three, after spending most of his adult life on constant high alert amid numbing tedium—a typical Secret Service agent’s daily existence— he seriously wondered just how demented he’d been to keep going. Hell, he could have found a hobby. Or at least a wife.

Alex bit his lip to mitigate the smoldering heat in his neck and stoically watched the prime minister’s wife cramming foie gras into her mouth.

What a gig.

CHAPTER

4

OLIVER STONE GOT OUT OF THE TAXI."
B000FC1J760,B000FC1J76,"Malcolm had known her for several years, since he had been asked to serve as an outside reader for her doctoral thesis at Berkeley.

Crossing the courtyard in the hot summer sun, they made an unlikely pair: Malcolm dressed in black, stooped and ascetic, leaning on his cane; Harding compact and muscular, looking young and energetic in shorts and a tee shirt, her short black hair pushed up on her forehead with sunglasses. Her field of study was African predators, lions and hyenas. She was scheduled to return to Nairobi the next day.

The two had been close since Malcolm’s surgery. Harding had been on a sabbatical year in Austin, and had helped nurse Malcolm back to health, after his many operations. For a while it seemed as if a romance had blossomed, and that Malcolm, a confirmed bachelor, would settle down. But then Harding had gone back to Africa, and Malcolm had gone to Santa Fe. Whatever their former relationship had been, they were now just friends.

They discussed the questions that had come at the end of his lecture. From Malcolm’s point of view, there had been only the predictable objections: that mass extinctions were important; that human beings owed their existence to the Cretaceous extinction, which had wiped out the dinosaurs and allowed the mammals to take over."
B000FC1J761,B000FC1J76,"In the process, many animal species were becoming extinct. Some scientists cried out in alarm; others were quietly uneasy. How fragile was the earth’s ecosystem? Was the human species engaged in behavior that would eventually lead to its own extinction?

No one was sure. Since nobody had ever bothered to study extinction in an organized way, there was little information about rates of extinction in other geological eras. So scientists began to look closely at extinction in the past, hoping to answer anxieties about the present.

The second development concerned new knowledge about the death of the dinosaurs. It had long been known that all dinosaur species had become extinct in a relatively short time at the end of the Cretaceous era, approximately sixty-five million years ago. Exactly how quickly those extinctions occurred was a subject of long-standing debate: some paleontologists believed they had been catastrophically swift, others felt the dinosaurs had died out more gradually, over a period of ten thousand to ten million years—hardly a rapid event.

Then, in 1980, physicist Luis Alvarez and three coworkers discovered high concentrations of the element iridium in rocks from the end of the Cretaceous and the start of the Tertiary—the so-called K-T boundary."
B01A5T4DBW0,B01A5T4DBW,"They’re doing the can-can, their giant bobble heads bopping along to the beat. I do a double take, because now I recognize the dude in the middle.

It’s Jed. She’s pasted Jed’s head on a dancing Jib Jab elf! Don’s the one beside him. And, oh, for the love of St. Nick! I cannot pee my pants at my desk, I must contain my laughter, but there’s Joan, prancing around in an ugly green collared top and red mini skirt.

Bless you, Trix. You’ve turned my least favorite colleague into a dancing elf.

I wipe the tears that are forming at the corners of my eyes and lower my head so no one can see the size of my smile. Smiles are rare at this law firm, especially at nine in the morning, unless we’re raising champagne glasses.

I can feel a presence at my right side. No, no, no, this isn’t happening. How did Joan creep in here so fast? I manage to cut the sound fast enough so she can’t make out the tune and hide the window so it keeps playing, but she can’t see the card on my screen.

Joan lets out a deep sigh, stares at my screen, and gets right to business."
B01A5T4DBW1,B01A5T4DBW,"I don’t feel like being teased right now. I’ll just have to get straight to work, after a cup of coffee and a quick check on my email. I shove the compact in my purse and sit back up.

I wonder if Trix has written me her daily email yet. We never did get into texting, although we exchange them here and there. We used to write post cards and snail-mail letters in college, and we still love exchanging long notes. I hope she’s sent me one today, because I need a good, long laugh. What else are BFFs for? I wake up my computer and open my email.

I can’t help but grin when I realize she’s sent me an early Christmas e-card. Oh, Trix, my dear old friend, you are the bomb. I turn up the speakers, not too loud, just enough to hear it, and press play. If it’s from Trix, this should be good.

Jib Jab are the first words that pop up on screen, and then the song, All I Want for Christmas Is You, starts spilling out from my desktop speakers. I start to giggle. Three little elves with skinny legs and huge heads are dancing across my screen."
B00N6PCZO00,B00N6PCZO0,"There were certain restaurants in New York where one went from being an actor who waited tables to, somehow, being a waiter who was once an actor. And if the restaurant was good enough, respected enough, that was not only a perfectly acceptable career transition, it was a preferable one. A waiter at a well-regarded restaurant could get his friends a coveted reservation, could charm the kitchen staff into sending out free dishes to those same friends (though as Willem learned, charming the kitchen staff was less easy than he’d thought it would be). But what could an actor who waited tables get his friends? Tickets to yet another off-off-Broadway production for which you had to supply your own suit because you were playing a stockbroker who may or may not be a zombie, and yet there was no money for costumes? (He’d had to do exactly that last year, and because he didn’t have a suit of his own, he’d had to borrow one of Jude’s. Jude’s legs were about an inch longer than his, and so for the duration of the run he’d had to fold the pants legs under and stick them in place with masking tape.)"
B00N6PCZO01,B00N6PCZO0,"It was in these moments that he loved JB completely, his ability and willingness to be wholly silly and frivolous, which he could never be with Malcolm or Jude—Malcolm because he was, for all his talk otherwise, interested in propriety, and Jude because he was serious.

Of course, this morning he had suffered. He woke in JB’s corner of Ezra’s loft, on JB’s unmade mattress (nearby, on the floor, JB himself snored juicily into a pile of peaty-smelling laundry), unsure how, exactly, they’d gotten back over the bridge. Willem wasn’t normally a drinker or a stoner, but around JB he occasionally found himself behaving otherwise. It had been a relief to return to Lispenard Street, its quiet and clean, the sunlight that baked his side of the bedroom hot and loafy between eleven a.m. and one p.m. already slanting through the window, Jude long gone for the day. He set his alarm and fell instantly asleep, waking with enough time only to shower and swallow an aspirin before hurrying to the train.

The restaurant where he worked had made its reputation on both its food—which was complicated without being challenging—and the consistency and approachability of its staff. At Ortolan they were taught to be warm but not familiar, accessible but not informal."
B072HFRNZY0,B072HFRNZY,"It was the singular 1940s holdover that clashed with all the new low-slung, ranch-style roadside motels popping up along A1A and U.S. 1 with the now-required swimming pools that every station wagon full of tykes demanded.

Attached to the hotel was a series of connected single-floor businesses, some retail, some office, always changing depending on the leaseholder. Like the people inside the address at 2441.

The enterprise had started in the fifties as a fancy international magazine headquartered in Manhattan. That changed in the 1960s. Whether it was the rent or a need for new scenery, they decided to up and move to Florida because—hey, they were a magazine, they could plant their stakes anywhere—and of all places they ended up here.

Inside, keys pounded a manual Underwood typewriter. Even though it was the holiday weekend, there was always a deadline. A young editor yanked a page from the roller and fed another. The editor was starting at the bottom but had ambition. He would reach fame in twenty years, but right now it was just another Sunday, and he had the office to himself. The perfect time to finish polishing one of his first short stories and see his own name in print between the magazine’s covers.

He took a break to fetch notes from his car. A Dodge Dart spotted him and rolled into the parking lot."
B072HFRNZY1,B072HFRNZY,"His skin was bronzed and prematurely aged, but his eyes were clear and hazelnut. He wasn’t muscular, because nobody worked out with weights back then, though his stomach was marble. They said he almost looked like Sandy Koufax, but not quite. On his left shoulder, a tattoo of an anchor and a ribbon indicated service on the USS Iowa. Gunner’s mate, Pacific theater, shelling the Japanese on the Eniwetok Atoll. He never talked about the war. The vintage of the tattoo meant he was now long in the tooth as surfers go, almost forty-three. To the kids, that was practically, well, dead. If the man had been any other adult, he would have been irrelevant. But this guy was the legend.

Word of his conquests leaked down into every local schoolyard, and the teens now surrounding him had been hearing the stories long before picking up their first board.

The surfer had been riding this coast since he was their age, often the only one in the water. And that was cool. The wartime experience had turned him into a spiritualist and a reader. Hermann Hesse, Aldous Huxley, The Dharma Bums. He developed a worldview that people complained too much."
B0184ZLSN00,B0184ZLSN0,"Nadia grunted, shifting on the couch. She stood and shuffled to the guest bedroom, dragging the throw blanket behind her.

I took the spot she vacated and let my mind drift. I thought of James and why he’d gone to Mexico when he did. Why not wait, or let Thomas handle the client? He was Donato Enterprises’ president, and overseeing the company’s furniture import/export operations was his job. As the finance executive, James’s responsibility was handling the books, not contract negotiations. But he’d insisted he was the only one who could manage this particular client. He’d left the day after I mailed our wedding invitations.

My eyes grew heavy and I drifted to sleep, my thoughts twisting. I dreamed about the woman in the parking lot. She was dressed from head to toe in black, and her eyes radiated an iridescent glow. She raised her arms over a prone form, and her lips moved. The melodic chant of her incantation vibrated the air around her and the body resting at her feet. A body that was now moving. That was when I realized the body wasn’t just any man. It was James. And Lacy was bringing him back from the dead."
B0184ZLSN01,B0184ZLSN0,"Kristen looked up from where she’d removed her shoes by the coffee table and frowned. She sank into the leather chair nearest the fireplace, tucking her feet underneath her legs. As I retreated to the master bedroom, I felt her eyes on me.

I went straight to the closet James and I had shared and opened the beveled doors. My clothes hung next to his suits. All charcoal, black, and navy. Some with pinstripes, but most solid. Power suits —that was what he’d called them. So different from the casual plaid shirts and jeans he’d wear at home.

Looking through his wardrobe, one would think the clothes belonged to two different people. Sometimes I’d felt I was living with two different men. The man who worked for Donato Enterprises was formal and polite compared with the free-spirited artist with sleeves rolled and paint splattered on his forearms.

I loved them both.

I pressed my nose against the sleeve of his favorite blue shirt and inhaled. Sandalwood and rich amber, his cologne, mixed with a hint of turpentine from cleaning his paint supplies. He’d worn this shirt the last time he painted, and behind my closed eyelids, I saw him, shoulder muscles rippling under the faded blue cotton as he wielded the brush."
B01HMRF5FI0,B01HMRF5FI,"The butcher’s face darkened, as if he’d just realized to whom he was talking. His glower was the only response he gave.

Davian kept his mouth shut after that.

Before long he was heading outside again, the butcher having regained his usual cool composure and instructed him to load up his cart around back. Davian looked briefly for the Shadow before leading Jeni into the alleyway beside the shop, but the young man had fled. He felt a brief pang of regret, wondering if he should have said something more in support. It would have been pointless, even foolish to bring down Master Dael’s inevitable wrath on himself. Still.

Before long Master Dael had helped him secure the last of his purchases and had disappeared back inside the shop. Davian took Jeni’s reins.

A small object flew over his shoulder from behind, missing his face by inches.

He spun, startled, to see a group of boys lounging at the mouth of the alleyway. They looked younger than him by a couple of years— they were perhaps fourteen—and all wore wide smiles as they observed his discomfort. One of the boys was standing, tossing another small rock from hand to hand, eyeing him in the same way Davian had seen cats eye mice."
B01HMRF5FI1,B01HMRF5FI,"For his part Davian kept his eyes lowered, trying not to meet the gaze of the townspeople giving him a wide berth. He’d been to Caladel many times before, but the wary, sometimes disgusted looks in the eyes that followed him still stung. After a while he found himself hunching his shoulders, as if the stares were a physical pressure on his back. He hurried between his destinations as unobtrusively as possible.

His purchases went smoothly today. In the past some merchants had refused to sell to him or had demanded outrageous prices for their goods; whenever that happened he knew to return to the school empty-handed rather than cause a scene. This afternoon, though, much to his relief, the storekeepers were cold but willing to trade. Most people didn’t want to be seen dealing with the Gifted, but the school brought in a lot of business—and when earnings were counted at the end of the day, a coin from the Gifted was just as good as one from anyone else.

Even so, it was with some relief that Davian hitched Jeni outside the small, dimly lit butcher’s shop that held the last items on his list. He’d dealt with the owner many times before, and didn’t anticipate any trouble."
B078T4ZMSQ0,B078T4ZMSQ,"They dealt with the traps first and then began to separate everything into different piles. Shiny things that could be sold for money went into one pile whereas useful things, like magical weapons or artefacts, went into another pile. Even with the sacks, which their zombies had returned to them after leaving the books with the zombies on the surface, they could only take so much. They had to prioritise the most valuable objects and the most useful ones. For example, Katie quite liked the silver and ivory chest in the corner, but it was large, heavy, and unwieldy. However, the magic mirror beside it had the potential to be far more useful. They’d come back for the chest later if they had the time, and they did have several zombie wyverns that they could load things onto. They could also make return trips to the island although Katie wasn’t sure how long they had before someone else came. Her master had paid for the information about the island to be given to them first, but it was only a matter of time before someone else found out. She liked the chest, but it wasn’t something worth fighting or dying for."
B078T4ZMSQ1,B078T4ZMSQ,"And a demon like this was not going to bother someone like Sam.

Sam bobbed up and down in the air, a large, amorphous sphere of warped flesh that almost completely filled the corridor. He extruded several tentacles and patted both Timmy and Katie down to check for any injuries before dozens of his eyes turned to the demon. The demon gave a deep growl, undoubtedly recognising Sam for what he was. A mantle of black fire erupted around the demon, and Katie hastily called their zombies back as her shadows disintegrated. Not even their zombie salamander would be able to protect them from that kind of heat. The stone at the demon’s feet began to melt, and the sound that came from its mouth as it rumbled forward was the howl of an inferno burning down a mountainside.

Several of their zombies were too slow to retreat, and they were turned to ash by the demon’s mantle of fire. Beads of sweat rolled down Katie’s face, and the other shadows she had on the walls, floor, and ceiling flickered and vanished. The demon’s blades took on a more solid form, the flames giving way to a jagged, obsidian-like substance."
B078JB5K2X0,B078JB5K2X,"Every time he’d visited Key West, he’d gone home asking himself why he didn’t get the hell out of New York and move down to a little house like that. Though he never quite succeeded in answering the question, he sort of suspected it was because living in a little house like that might make him more relaxed and maybe even happy, and contentment might dull the edge of his subversive tendencies, and apparently that scared him.

Now he walked up the three cheerily creaking steps that led to the front door. Only the screen was closed and he could see clear through the living room and kitchen to the compact backyard with its buttonwood hedge and small turquoise patch of swimming pool. That was another thing he loved about Pat’s house—that you could look right through it, it didn’t blot out the day the way big houses or apartment buildings did; it was more like just a brief parenthesis in a long flowing sentence with spacious outdoor clauses both before and after it.

He pressed his nose against the screen and sang out a hello. Pat came through the French doors at the back of the house and gestured him in. They fell into a hug then stood back for a good look at one another."
B078JB5K2X1,B078JB5K2X,"She didn’t reply because just then the door to her little club swung violently open and a naked man came storming in.

The naked guy was kind of short but reasonably buff, and tan from head to toe, though the tan had an unnatural coppery-vermilion sheen to it, especially on his well-toned buttocks. He was wearing a cheap and spiky plastic wig and large round sunglasses with thick white frames.

Taking long, low steps like Groucho Marx, he bounded up onto the stage, seized the mic from the flabbergasted comic who’d been failing with the hip-hop thing, and sang the first few words of The Star-Spangled Banner to the tune of Happy Birthday. Then he sang the first few words of Happy Birthday to the tune of The Star-Spangled Banner. Then he quietly handed the microphone back, jumped down off the stage and ran out the way he’d entered.

There was a moment of stunned silence as the door slammed shut behind his tinted posterior. Then, uneasily at first, then more wholeheartedly, people started to laugh. They were in a comedy club, after all, and they were in Key West, and it was nearly one a.m. They thought the crazy naked guy was one more part of the show."
B01FHSOP7S0,B01FHSOP7S,"When our drop-ship flight dips into the storm, the Hornets get instantly bounced around by the turbulent air currents. I’ve had many rough atmospheric entries in my podhead career, but as we careen toward the surface of Greenland in what feels like barely controlled flight, getting rattled like peas in a can, I can’t recall ever having been in such violent weather before. But there are thirty junior enlisted SI and HD troopers sitting in the jump seats to either side and across the aisle from me, so I keep my face shield raised and do my best to appear unconcerned.

The tactical network is strangely quiet. I see our flight of four drop ships, a full company of troops, descending toward Joint Base Thule in the corkscrew pattern of a combat descent. There are more military flights in nearby airspace— two HD ground-attack birds coming in from the south, fifty klicks away and five thousand feet below us, and a flight of Eurocorps drop ships approaching from the interior of Greenland, still a hundred kilometers out and descending in Delta formation. But there’s nothing coming from below, no tactical markers from the units that should be on and around the big joint air/space base we share with the Euros at Thule."
B01FHSOP7S1,B01FHSOP7S,"The train whisks us from Liberty Falls to Burlington in less than fifteen minutes—faster than usual because it’s a military requisition running outside the regular schedule. We check and recheck each other’s gear, even though there isn’t much to fasten and calibrate compared to regular battle armor, but it’s something for the hands and brain to do on autopilot, and it helps to fight the anxiety we both feel. Other than the first alert, there have been no further updates over MilNet, so our brains are coming up with a wide variety of possible scenarios, everything from a single Lanky ship to a full-scale assault by the Lanky fleet currently amassing around Mars. I remember my vivid dream from last night, and I hope it wasn’t a ninety-six-hour glimpse into the future. I am not physically or mentally ready for that day yet.

HDAS Burlington has its own stop on the maglev line. We file out of the train along with the few dozen other corps members who answered the emergency call in the area. The security checkpoint at the base entrance outside the station is manned by half a dozen HD troopers in full battle armor, M-66 rifles at low ready. Halley and I check in to have our IDs scanned."
B004J4WKTW0,B004J4WKTW,"Once a year, the same man takes measurements for new clothing.

The boy spends most of his time reading. And writing, of course. He copies down sections of books, writes out words and symbols he does not understand at first but that become intimately familiar beneath his ink-stained fingers, formed again and again in increasingly steady lines. He reads histories and mythologies and novels. He slowly learns other languages, though he has difficulty speaking them.

There are occasional excursions to museums and libraries, during off-hours when there are few, if any, other visitors. The boy adores these trips, both for the contents of the buildings and the deviation from his set routine. But they are rare, and he is never permitted to leave the house unescorted.

The man in the grey suit visits him in his rooms every day, most often accompanied by a new pile of books, spending exactly one hour lecturing about things the boy is unsure he will ever truly understand.

Only once does the boy inquire as to when he will actually be allowed to do something, the kinds of things that the man in the grey suit demonstrates very rarely himself during these strictly scheduled lessons."
B004J4WKTW1,B004J4WKTW,"They blend together in a haze of must and velvet and sawdust to the point where she sometimes does not recall what country she is in, not that it matters.

Her father brings her everywhere while she is small, parading her like a well-loved small dog in expensive gowns, for his colleagues and acquaintances to fawn over in pubs after performances.

When he decides she is too tall to be an adorable accessory, he begins abandoning her in dressing rooms or hotels.

She wonders each night if perhaps he will not return, but he always stumbles in at unseemly hours, sometimes petting her gently on the head while she pretends to be asleep, other times ignoring her entirely.

Her lessons have become less formal. When before he would sit her down at marked, though irregular, times, now he tests her constantly, but never in public.

Even tasks as simple as tying her boots he forbids her to do by hand. She stares at her feet, silently willing the laces to tie and untie in messy bows, scowling when they tangle into knots.

Her father is not forthcoming when she asks questions. She has gathered that the man in the grey suit whom her father called Alexander also has a student, and there will be some sort of game."
B00DGZKU880,B00DGZKU88,"And, though herself unfortunately childless, she was esteemed as a lecturer and writer about Child Culture, and she was the author of a volume of nursery lyrics, including the immortal couplet:

All of the Roundies are resting in rows,

With roundy-roundies around their toes.

But always, 1917 or 1936, she was a raging member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The D.A.R. (reflected the cynic, Doremus Jessup, that evening) is a somewhat confusing organization—as confusing as Theosophy, Relativity, or the Hindu Vanishing Boy Trick, all three of which it resembles. It is composed of females who spend one half their waking hours boasting of being descended from the seditious American colonists of 1776, and the other and more ardent half in attacking all contemporaries who believe in precisely the principles for which those ancestors struggled.

The D.A.R. (reflected Doremus) has become as sacrosanct, as beyond criticism, as even the Catholic Church or the Salvation Army. And there is this to be said: it has provided hearty and innocent laughter for the judicious, since it has contrived to be just as ridiculous as the unhappily defunct Kuklux Klan, without any need of wearing, like the K.K.K., high dunces’ caps and public nightshirts."
B00DGZKU881,B00DGZKU88,"she who was no more renowned for her gallant anti-suffrage campaigning way back in 1919 than she was for having, during the Great War, kept the American soldiers entirely out of French cafés by the clever trick of sending them ten thousand sets of dominoes.

Nor could any social-minded patriot sneeze at her recent somewhat unappreciated effort to maintain the purity of the American Home by barring from the motion-picture industry all persons, actors or directors or cameramen, who had: (a) ever been divorced; (b) been born in any foreign country—except Great Britain, since Mrs. Gimmitch thought very highly of Queen Mary, or (c) declined to take an oath to revere the Flag, the Constitution, the Bible, and all other peculiarly American institutions.

The Annual Ladies’ Dinner was a most respectable gathering—the flower of Fort Beulah. Most of the ladies and more than half of the gentlemen wore evening clothes, and it was rumored that before the feast the inner circle had had cocktails, privily served in Room 289 of the hotel. The tables, arranged on three sides of a hollow square, were bright with candles, cut-glass dishes of candy and slightly tough almonds, figurines of Mickey Mouse, brass Rotary wheels, and small silk American flags stuck in gilded hard-boiled eggs."
B002U5HKZ60,B002U5HKZ6,"Sitting at Leopold’s, night after night, and listening to the conversations at the tables around me, I heard many foreigners and not a few Indians complain about the corruption that adhered to every aspect of public and commercial life in Bombay. My few weeks in the city had already shown me that those complaints were often fair, and often true. But there’s no nation uncorrupted. There’s no system that’s immune to the misuse of money. Privileged and powerful elites grease the wheels of their progress with kickbacks and campaign contributions in the noblest assemblies. And the rich, all over the world, live longer and healthier lives than the poor. There is a difference between the dishonest bribe and the honest bribe, Didier Levy once said to me. The dishonest bribe is the same in every country, but the honest bribe is India’s alone. I smiled when he said that, because I knew what he meant. India was open. India was honest. And I liked that from the first day. My instinct wasn’t to criticise. My instinct, in the city I was learning to love, was to observe, and become involved, and enjoy. I couldn’t know then that, in the months and years to come, my freedom and even my life would depend on the Indian willingness to tilt the mirror."
B002U5HKZ61,B002U5HKZ6,"Deals for drugs and other contraband were openly transacted at the tables, but the goods could only be exchanged outside the bar. It was common enough to see buyer and seller reach agreement on price, walk outside to hand over money and goods, then walk back inside to resume their places at a table. Even the bureaucrats and influence peddlers were bound by those unwritten rules: agreements reached in the dark booths of the upstairs bar could only be sealed, with handshakes and cash, on the pavement outside, so that no man could say he’d paid or received bribes within the walls of Leopold’s.

While the fine lines that divided and connected the legal and illegal were nowhere more elegantly drawn, they weren’t unique to the diverse society of Leopold’s. The traders in the street stalls outside sold counterfeits of Lacoste, Cardin, and Cartier with a certain impudent panache, the taxi drivers parked along the street accepted tips to tilt their mirrors away from the unlawful or forbidden acts that took place on the seats behind them, and a number of the cops who attended to their duties with diligence, at the station across the road, had paid hefty bribes for the privilege of that lucrative posting in the city centre."
B06XQ544VG0,B06XQ544VG,"The hammer clanged against the chisel. The blade made a heavy, reverberating thunk when it hit the rock. The noise echoed through the cavernous church, much more loudly than he had anticipated. Cold fear gripped his chest, but he couldn’t stop now.

Clang, thunk, clang, thunk, clang, thunk.

Marble dust swirled and settled into his hair and clothes. Sweat mixed with grime, creating a gray paste that slid into his eyes. It stung.

The serene face of the Virgin Mary stared down at him. He stopped hammering. Silence engulfed him as he waited for the lady to admonish him for cutting into her chest. Most believed marble was nothing but inert rock, but Michelangelo knew life coursed through its veins, just as blood pumped through the hearts of men. He whispered to Mary, but even he wasn’t always sure what he said when he spoke the language of the stone.

A swish of movement caught his eye. Was it a rodent scurrying across the nave? A bird stuck in the rafters? A cloud passing over the moon? Then he saw the outline of a torch-bearing figure gliding down the far aisle outside the chapel. The maniacal sound of carving must have woken the priests."
B06XQ544VG1,B06XQ544VG,"He had to find a way to ensure that no one ever attributed his sculpture to anyone but him. But how?

Then an idea popped into his head, so perfect that it must have been sent from heaven. To set God’s plan for his life back on track, he needed to inscribe his name directly into the Pietà, so no one could ever mistake who carved it.

There was only one problem. Michelangelo didn’t own the Pietà anymore. It belonged to the church. He couldn’t simply walk up to it and start hacking into the stone. Someone would stop him. Maybe even arrest him. No. To carve his name into the sculpture, he would have to do it late at night, when all the worshipers were gone, the doors closed and locked, and the priests fast asleep.

And to do that, Michelangelo was going to have to break into the Vatican.

Michelangelo peeked out of his hiding place behind a tomb in a decaying side chapel. He had been lying in wait for hours. Finally, all was quiet. Dark. He told himself to stop obsessing about what might happen if he were caught vandalizing church property. He was protecting his family name. He would risk anything."
B077Z2MGB20,B077Z2MGB2,"Reaching down, I found I was sitting on that stupid pen. I stared at it for a moment in surprise. With everything that had happened, I’d forgotten about the midget’s pen.

Shoving the pen and the notebook in the cup holder, I started my car and sped toward the rear exit because M16s and Roger Stevens don’t mix. Not even slightly.

Thankfully, the exit was only a few meters away. With any luck, I could escape this place before it became a total clusterfuck. The absolute last thing I wanted to do was get shot by those SWAT-looking motherfuckers or blown up. No. All, I wanted to do was run and hide.

As I exited and pulled onto the main street, I slammed my foot on the gas, rocketing away as fast as my beat up Kia could take me. Then I made a right, and a left, and a few other turns. I didn’t think anyone was following me, but I couldn’t be too sure.

After about fifteen minutes of driving in a direction that could only really be classified as away, my phone rang, and I nearly jumped out of my skin before I realized what was going on."
B077Z2MGB21,B077Z2MGB2,"The midget had been nice, sure, but at the same time, the moment he’d pointed at me, they had opened fire. He could deal with whatever the fuck this was.

No, I needed to not be here. Taking a deep breath and trying to calm myself, I pushed down the pain in my chest and legs and began to hobble toward my car while trying my best to stick to the crowds of people rushing into the parking lot. I threw quick glances around, trying to find the guys with the guns, but I didn’t see them anywhere. They’d vanished from sight. On the one hand, that made me feel a lot better, but on the other?

On the other, I just worried they’d sneak up behind me and jam a knife into my kidneys. I wasn’t even sure who they were, but one thing was certain, they’d wanted me dead enough to open fire on me.

Careful to stay in the crowds, I slowly made my way to my shitty Kia. Even though my whole body hurt and my clothes were covered in blood, grime, and everything else, I was glad to have reached it without anyone killing me.

I quickly unlocked my car, and as I slid into the driver’s seat, something jabbed into my ass."
B071HCW3V80,B071HCW3V8,"Cap put the camera in his pocket and drove away, heading home, to Denville. He stopped at the beer distributors close to his house, picked up a case of Yuengling for him and club soda for Nell. In the parking lot he walked past a guy who looked familiar, but in a town of fifteen thousand everyone looked familiar. At the grocery store you ran into the guy who cut your hair and the woman who’d served you an Irish Car Bomb on the house last weekend. At your kid’s soccer game you saw the postman and the city councilman and the gal who handed out free samples in front of StoneField Ice Cream. The longer he was a cop, the more Cap thought this was not such a nice thing. He hated knowing people. The Iraq War vet who he used to shake hands with at bars eventually holed up in his house with a jug of vodka and a gun. The flirty waitress at Applebee’s who left her newborn in the garbage in the restaurant bathroom. The former high school football star who OD’d on oxy and Heineken. Keep your small towns, thought Cap. Give me a city where I don’t recognize the corpse."
B071HCW3V81,B071HCW3V8,"Cap thought as he watched it all through the screen. He zoomed in as much as he could on the couple, getting their entire bodies in the frame. You wanted to see the body language as much as the face, he’d found. Hands and hips and feet. If they didn’t kiss you wanted to see how they touched, and if they didn’t touch, if you could see every part of them, it was easier to see if they wanted to.

These two touched. The man had his hand on her elbow, her arm was around the life preserver, both of them talking with their mouths downward, whispering, thought Cap. The man said something, and the woman laughed and then put her fingers to his lips, like she was shushing him. Playful, intimate. Then the woman got in her car and drove away, and the man watched her go. He walked across the lot to his car, and then sat in the driver’s seat for a couple of minutes. He sat, and Cap sat. Cap watched him rub his face with the heels of the hands and then the fingers. Guilty, big guy? Then the man drove away. Cap tapped Pause."
B003B02O000,B003B02O00,"Arnie watched one day in Kansas City when Rick threw a football eighty yards, then a few minutes later clocked a bullet at ninety miles an hour.

But Arnie knew what most coaches now strongly suspected. Rick, for a football player, was afraid of contact. Not the incidental contact, not the quick and harmless tackle of a scrambling quarterback. Rick, with good reason, feared the rushing tackles and the blitzing linebackers.

There is a moment or two in every game when a quarterback has a receiver open, a split second to throw the ball, and a massive, roaring lineman charging the pocket unblocked. The quarterback has a choice. He can grit his teeth, sacrifice his body, put his team first, throw the damned ball, make the play, and get crushed, or he can tuck it and run and pray he lives for another play. Rick, as long as Arnie had watched him play, had never, not once, put the team first. At the first hint of a sack, Rick flinched and ran frantically for the sideline.

And with a propensity for concussions, Arnie really couldn’t blame him.

He called a nephew of the owner of the Rams, who answered the phone with an icy"
B003B02O001,B003B02O00,"The execution was public—big press conference, lots of frowns and promises to run a tighter ship, et cetera. The Browns would be back!

Arnie met Rick during his senior year at Iowa, at the end of a season that had begun with much promise but was fading into a third-tier bowl game. Rick started at quarterback his last two seasons, and he seemed well suited for a dropback, open-style offense so rare in the Big Ten. At times he was brilliant—reading defenses, coolly checking off at the line, firing the ball with incredible velocity. His arm was amazing, undoubtedly the best in the upcoming draft. He could throw long and hard with a lightning-quick release.

But he was too erratic to be trusted, and when Buffalo picked him in the last round, it should have been a clear sign that he needed to pursue a master’s degree or a stockbroker’s license.

Instead, he went to Toronto for two miserable seasons, then began bouncing around the NFL. With a great arm, Rick was just barely good enough to make a roster. Every team needs a third-string quarterback. In tryouts, and there had been many, he’d often dazzled coaches with his arm."
B009JU5G5Q0,B009JU5G5Q,"With a few hours’ rest, she would feel fitter than the best day of her life, but even that was but a pale shadow of how she felt in the night.

How did Arlen retain his power in the sunlight? Was it that his wards were permanent tattoos rather than blackstem stains? If so, she would take a needle and ink to her skin that very day.

The demon corpses burned hot and fast, in seconds leaving only scorched ground and ash. Renna stamped out the last few scrub fires before they had a chance to grow, and then finally gave in to her exhaustion, curling next to Twilight Dancer and falling asleep.

Renna was still next to Twilight Dancer when she awoke, but rather than the moss bed she had gone to sleep on, she was now lying on a rough blanket in the back of a trundling cart. She popped her head up and saw Arlen out front wearing the yoke. He pulled them along at an impressive pace.

The sight washed the last vestige of sleep from her, and Renna vaulted easily into the driver’s seat, grabbing the reins and giving them a loud crack. Arlen jumped straight up in surprise, and Renna laughed."
B009JU5G5Q1,B009JU5G5Q,"And the knife …

The knife had punched through the chest of a coreling prince. Even now, its magic shone brightly to her warded eyes. Not just the wards—the entire blade had a dull glow to it. It drew blood on her finger at the barest touch.

She knew the power would burn away with the sun, but at the moment, the weapon seemed invincible. Even in the day, it would be stronger. Magic always left things better than it found them. Likewise, the barest brush of the polishing cloth brought the necklace back to a shine, the cord even tougher than when it was made.

Renna stood guard over Twilight Dancer until dawn. The morning sun struck the scattered bodies of the corelings, setting them ablaze. It was a sight she never tired of, though it came at a heavy price. Even as the demons burned, the blackstem wards on her skin began to tingle as their magic faded. The knife grew hot in its sheath, burning her leg. She had to lean against a tree for support, feeling like a Jongleur’s puppet with the strings cut, weak and half blind.

The disorientation passed quickly, and Renna took a deep breath."
B079YMRMZD0,B079YMRMZD,"I saw the opening in the trees to his driveway and took it, driving back onto the property. I parked next to his truck and killed the engine. Okay, how long could I wait in here before it looked weird? I opened the door and got out, walking out into the snow. I had come prepared in more than enough layers.

I was about to go over to the house, but I stopped at the stairs seeing him on the porch. The tarp was pulled off of his wood pile, and he was stacking newly split logs. It had grown since I had last seen it a few days ago; had he gone out to harvest lately? Impressive. Winter was the hardest time to do it. I looked down on the ground where he had his chopping block. The maul was stuck in the wood and stood up against the side of the porch were two sizeable logs. He must have found a tree today; I had caught him right in the middle of chopping it up. I started up the steps instead of saying anything. He heard me and looked up. The shock passed over his face quickly, then disappeared, replaced by a smile."
B079YMRMZD1,B079YMRMZD,"How had I managed to get to this place with him? What a fucking mess.

How would he react? Thinking about that occupied my mind for the rest of the steady incline up the road to Cameron's cabin. The snow looked like it had been recently plowed, probably by one of Cameron's neighbors. I had my fingers crossed for as much luck tomorrow when I would make this trip yet again.

Might as well move in at this point, I thought, finally getting to the fork in the road that meant I was almost there. It had already started getting dark. Nerves began to set in the closer I got. What did I say to him? What did I do when I saw him again? It had only been days; he would have to have some suspicions about why I was back already. If he didn’t think that the last visits weren’t because of Brett, he’d have to know that this one was. It was a fucking Monday; he’d know that the only way I would have even gotten permission to be out here would have been through Brett. He’d see right through me.

If turning back had been an option, then I would have taken it."

Wouldn’t you like to go home and get some sleep? One of us should. Wouldn’t your living room be preferable? The risk there is so low of someone coming in with a gunshot wound.

At first Penn wouldn’t write about the sick kids and their sick parents, the kids struck with cancers and heart diseases and accidents and violence in their homes, the parents struck with sick kids. Sick kids defied all narrative theory he’d ever known. There was nothing redemptive about a dying child. There was nothing that could be learned from a kid coming in shot or beaten that made it worth a kid getting shot or beaten. This had always pissed him off about Romeo and Juliet, its ending platitude that at least the feud was laid to rest and the fighting families had come together as if this somehow made it worth losing their teenagers. As if Romeo and Juliet would have been willing to die just so their parents would get along."
B01HW6Z3FG1,B01HW6Z3FG,"So reading and writing in Rosie’s hospital waiting room was something he was long practiced for: lots of crying people, lots of pathos, the heights of tragedy, the heights of relief, which looked a lot like the heights of tragedy, and lots of that odd paradox he’d observed at Newark International that lay at the heart of waiting—that even when what people were waiting for was the worst news of their life or the best, even when the waiting was heavy with implication and consequence, waiting people still transformed into cranky toddlers, impatient and frowning and red-faced infuriated with vending machines that dispensed the wrong thing, and kids who did not use their inside voice. You’d think people in a hospital waiting room would be kindred spirits, compatriots, like soldiers who’d served together, fellow citizens of a hollowed, harrowed world, but no, mostly they avoided one another’s eyes and heaved great passive-aggressive sighs in one another’s direction whenever someone had the audacity to get attention from the nurses first.

Penn wooed and studied, watched and listened and made notes for stories. He read. He wrote. Rosie would emerge every few hours, sometimes blood-spattered, sometimes vomit-splashed, always frazzled, always exhausted and red-eyed. Always rosy. And always glad to see him in spite of her protestations. And these were many: Aren’t you uncomfortable out here? The chairs are gross, and the food is awful."
B000FC13Y00,B000FC13Y0,"The person, whoever, whatever it was, farted, scratched itself, and began to snore once more.

Dunstan listened to the rain on the byre roof, and thought about Daisy Hempstock, and in his thoughts they were walking together, and six steps behind them walked a tall man with a top hat and a small, furry creature whose face Dunstan could not see. They were off to see his Heart’s Desire. . . .

* * *

There was bright sunlight on his face, and the cow byre was empty. He washed his face, and walked up to the farmhouse.

He put on his very best jacket, and his very best shirt, and his very best britches. He scraped the mud from his boots with his pocketknife. Then he walked into the farm kitchen, and kissed his mother on the cheek, and helped himself to a cottage loaf and a large pat of fresh-churned butter.

And then, with his money tied up in his fine Sunday cambric handkerchief, he walked up to the village of Wall and bade good morning to the guards on the gate.

Through the gap in the wall he could see colored tents being raised, stalls being erected, colored flags, and people walking back and forth."
B000FC13Y01,B000FC13Y0,"Some of them attempted to strike up conversations with Dunstan or Tommy, but the young men, proud of their status as guards, declined to converse, contenting themselves by raising their heads, tightening their lips, and generally looking important.

At lunchtime, Daisy Hempstock brought by a small pot of shepherd’s pie for them both, and Bridget Comfrey brought them each a mug of spiced ale.

And, at twilight, another two able-bodied young men of the village arrived to relieve them, carrying a lantern each, and Tommy and Dunstan walked down to the inn where Mr. Bromios gave each of them a mug of his best ale—and his best ale was very fine indeed—as their reward for doing guard duty. There was a buzz of excitement in the inn, now crowded beyond believing. It was filled with visitors to the village from every nation in the world, or so it seemed to Dunstan who had no sense of distance beyond the woods that surrounded the village of Wall, so he regarded the tall gentleman in the black top hat at the table beside him, all the way up from London, with as much awe as he regarded the taller ebony-colored gentleman in the white one-piece robe with whom he was dining."
B000FBJHZS0,B000FBJHZS,"The first microbot prototypes could only recharge their energy cells by hovering directly beneath a bright light source, not ideal for stealth or use in dark locales. The newer prototypes, however, could recharge simply by parking within a few inches of a magnetic field. Conveniently, in modern society, magnetic fields were ubiquitous and discreetly placed—power outlets, computer monitors, electric motors, audio speakers, cellphones— it seemed there was never any shortage of obscure recharging stations. Once a microbot had been introduced successfully into a locale, it could transmit audio and video almost indefinitely. The Delta Force’s PH2 had been transmitting for over a week now with no trouble whatsoever.

• • •

Now, like an insect hovering inside a cavernous barn, the airborne microbot hung silently in the still air of the structure’s massive central room. With a bird’s-eye view of the space below, the microbot circled silently above unsuspecting occupants—technicians, scientists, specialists in numerous fields of study. As the PH2 circled, Delta-One spotted two familiar faces engaged in conversation. They would be a telling mark. He told Delta-Two to drop down and have a listen.

Manipulating the controls, Delta-Two switched on the robot’s sound sensors, oriented the microbot’s parabolic amplifier, and decreased the robot’s elevation until it was ten feet over the scientists’ heads. The transmission was faint, but discernible."
B000FBJHZS1,B000FBJHZS,"Two minutes later, Rachel had parked and crossed the manicured grounds to the main entrance, where a carved granite sign announced

NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE (NRO)

The two armed Marines flanking the bulletproof revolving door stared straight ahead as Rachel passed between them. She felt the same sensation she always felt as she pushed through these doors . . . that she was entering the belly of a sleeping giant.

Inside the vaulted lobby, Rachel sensed the faint echoes of hushed conversations all around her, as if the words were sifting down from the offices above. An enormous tiled mosaic proclaimed the NRO directive:

ENABLING U.S. GLOBAL INFORMATION SUPERIORITY, DURING PEACE AND THROUGH WAR.

The walls here were lined with massive photographs—rocket launches, submarine christenings, intercept installations —towering achievements that could be celebrated only within these walls.

Now, as always, Rachel felt the problems of the outside world fading behind her. She was entering the shadow world. A world where the problems thundered in like freight trains, and the solutions were meted out with barely a whisper.

As Rachel approached the final checkpoint, she wondered what kind of problem had caused her pager to ring twice in the last thirty minutes."
B01MXMY3NQ0,B01MXMY3NQ,"In the Crimea during the Byzantine era, the Khazars, a war-like people, adopted Judaism, but in the tenth century the Khazars were defeated and dispersed by the Russians much as the Jews were driven from the Holy Land. The Russians swept them out and they have never been heard of since, and their empire was consolidated under Christianity of the Greek Orthodox leaning.

Jews suffered maltreatment during the years of their dispersion in all countries of their dispersion from massacres to expulsions. The fever of Jew baiting heightened to a new level during the Spanish Inquisition, when torture and bestiality were as common as daily prayer.

In the Dark Ages the Jews were blamed for the Black Plague and for witchcraft and for ritual murder.

But it was the Crusaders under the flag of Holy Purification and in the name of God who set out to kill every Jew in Europe. The massacres became so bloody that wave after wave of Jews fled from the fountainhead of butchery in Bohemia to the newly emerging kingdom of Poland.

Here the Jews were welcomed and this was their real beginning, along with the beginning of Poland itself. Jews were needed, for there was no middle class between the landed gentry and the peasants. The Jews brought with them their arts, crafts, trades, professions, and ability as merchants."
B01MXMY3NQ1,B01MXMY3NQ,"Andrei was humiliated, as befitted a Ulany officer in a contest with a mere mortal. As Chris poured his strength into his hand and pressed downward, a roar went up from the crowd and the odds shifted quickly. Andrei’s face turned first red, then purple with strain, and the veins fairly leaped out of his neck.

Their wrists quivered.

Suddenly the innumerable pints of vodka caught up with Chris. He was unable to make the final pin. Andrei, sensing the weakness of his opponent, called on the reserve strength of a great athlete, and Chris wilted.

Utter silence gripped the mob as Andrei came inching back from the brink of defeat. The sweat rolled down Chris’s face as he tried to fight off the inevitable. He collapsed. Andrei made the kill with such speed and power that Chris was thrown right out of his chair and went sprawling into the spectators.

The Ulan officer stood up, wavering, and raised both arms over his head to receive his deserved accolades, then bent down to help his victim to his feet. Bloody, but unbowed, Chris’s hand lashed out, caught Andrei by the heel of his shiny boot, and sent him crashing to the floor. They both lay on their backs, convulsed with laughter."
B077LYGDXF0,B077LYGDXF,"Archer had no idea what to expect on the two-lane road north of Rushville. The location was odd, to say the least. An out-of-the-way road that Major Smith didn’t have any business travelling, from what she could tell. Then again, for all she knew, Larsen might have hijacked one of Smith’s vehicles somehow and randomly swiped the card during his escape. That was the least likely of scenarios she’d run through her head.

Most likely, Smith had somehow met up with Larsen in the city. Maybe at the hospital—a likely place for Larsen to seek help if he was injured. He’d probably persuaded Smith to smuggle him out of the city, filling the soldier’s head with enough conspiracy theories about the outbreak to convince him to disable his vehicle’s digital transmitter. For whatever reason, Smith had run the identification card through the card reader on the road outside Rushville. Maybe he was suspicious. Who knew? Maybe Smith booted him from the vehicle after running the card and seeing that the badge was crap.

If that was the case, she might have a chance to wrap this up quickly. He couldn’t get very far on foot in five hours. Especially starting off at night."

A few more keystrokes would activate an Ajax contingency protocol designed to handle more sensitive missions. The kind that couldn’t be solved with a GPS-guided bomb or a small team of loyal operatives.

Archer would let the Colonel figure out how to handle this one. She didn’t have the authority to put an entire infantry company under house arrest. Even if she did, Archer didn’t have the resources to back up that authority. An entire battalion of National Guard soldiers stood in the way.

SPF Bravo, commanded by Major Nick Smith, was assigned to Provisional Operating Base (POB) Greenfield, a massive, hastily assembled collection of tent-cities set up to accommodate military units delivering infected citizens to the quarantine detention and disposal center a few miles east of town. The disposal aspect of the facility was a secret—even to military commanders and local government officials carrying out federal orders within the incident zone (IZ).

She checked the last few boxes on the tablet screen and sent the report to Cooper. Hopefully she’d have some actionable intelligence before he responded with a plan of action. According to the pilot’s last update, they’d arrive over their destination in less than fifteen minutes."
B0046A9MSG0,B0046A9MSG,"For seconds the police officer remained where he had fallen, moaning and fighting for breath, half-lying, half-kneeling across his own desk, while his own men still stood motionless, the suddenness, the unbelievable shock of it holding them in thrall. It was just at this moment that the door crashed open and a gust of icy air swept into the hut.

Reynolds twisted round in his chair. The man who had flung open the door stood framed in the opening, his intensely cold blue eyes – a very pale blue indeed – taking in every detail of the scene. A lean, broad-shouldered man so tall that the uncovered thick brown hair almost touched the lintel of the doorway, he was dressed in a military, high-collared trench-coat, belted and epauleted, vaguely greenish under a dusting of snow, so long-skirted that it hid the top of his high, gleaming jackboots. The face matched the eyes: the bushy eyebrows, the flaring nostrils above the clipped moustache, the thin chiselled mouth all lent to the hard, handsome face that indefinable air of cold authority of one long accustomed to immediate and unquestioning obedience.

Two seconds were enough to complete his survey – two seconds would always be enough for this man , Reynolds guessed: no astonished looks, no"
B0046A9MSG1,B0046A9MSG,"Reynolds stopped, made to speak and if possible clear the driver, but had no chance: two of the policemen, all brisk officiousness now that they were once more in the presence of headquarters and immediate authority, caught his arms and hustled him in through the doors of the hut.

The hut was small, square and ill-made, the chinks in its walls closed up with wadded wet newspaper, and sparsely furnished: a portable wood stove with its chimney sticking through the roof, a telephone, two chairs and a battered little desk. Behind the desk sat the officer in charge, a small fat man, middle-aged, red-faced and insignificant. He would have liked his porcine little eyes to have had a cold, penetrating stare, but it didn’t quite come off: his air of spurious authority he wore like a threadbare cloak. A nonentity, Reynolds judged, possibly even, in given circumstances – such as the present – a dangerous little nonentity, but ready for all that to collapse like a pricked balloon at the first contact with real authority. A little bluster could do no harm.

Reynolds broke away from the hands of the men holding him, reached the desk in two paces and smashed down his fist so heavily that the telephone on the rickety little desk jumped and gave a tiny, chime-like ring."
B076ZSHD110,B076ZSHD11,"And Leo was inside of Grey. Kissing me.

His mouth found mine again, but this time I stiffened, pressing my lips together into a hard line. He kept trying to kiss me, his mouth working on mine, trying to get me to soften. Suddenly I felt trapped under him, and the sensation grew steadily as he continued to kiss me, seemingly oblivious to my frozen state. I started counting the seconds off in my head, waiting for him to get the signal, but didn’t make it past two before I hooked his leg and pushed his shoulder, throwing him off of me and back onto the bed. Then I was up and moving, ignoring the icy touch of the floor under my feet as I tried to get as far away from Leo as possible.

I made it to the corner by the door and turned, placing my back against the wall, my chest heaving. Leo lay on his side, watching me with a bemused glint in his now dark chocolate eyes. I couldn’t imagine Leo being capable of generating a look like that, but there it was… and it was filling me with some confused feelings. This needed to stop."
B076ZSHD111,B076ZSHD11,"I lifted my head as he dipped his down again for another kiss, and he started kissing my neck instead. My body shivered in response, but my mind… It kept screaming at me that there was something wrong. That this wasn’t a dream.

But I knew that. I knew it wasn’t a dream. I was with Grey, and everything was fine. I’d just had a nightmare, that was all. Grey kissed his way back up the length of my neck, his tongue darting out to trace delicious patterns against my skin.

Only this time, the hair on my arms and neck rose up in alarm as the nightmare from last night crept into my mind. It was getting ridiculous. I needed something to remind myself that this was real, and that everything else had been a nightmare. What had I done before I’d gone to sleep?

He rained kisses on my jawline, trying to distract me, but a slightly queasy feeling started to overcome me. I needed to figure out what was going on. I closed my eyes and focused, and seconds later, it all came rushing back to me. I had wanted to dismiss it as a nightmare, but it hadn’t been. Ambrose had been murdered, Maddox beaten. I had broken down in the worst possible way."

Once they’re halfway in, the security officers break their formation. That allows the Prime Minister to walk past them. The men stand guard on either side of the Prime Minister in a well-rehearsed drill. That's when I lay eyes on her. She's hanging from her father's arm and gliding across the floor like an angel. That white dress she’s wearing should come with a warning. Her cascade of long wavy brown hair falls seductively over her shoulders. She really looks like she just dropped from Heaven. As I move my gaze up, her piercing green eyes lock onto mine for a fraction of a second. Jesus. I’ve been shot at, I’ve stood mere feet away from landmines and I’ve averted death more times than I can count, but I’ve never felt my breath leave me like it does now. Wow. I'm so hypnotized by this woman’s stunning beauty that it takes me a minute before realization hits me as hard as a freight train. Huh?

I whip my head towards my best friend. I read his shocked look."

I’ve been coaxing myself to relax, but my stomach is still tied up in a knot. I'm not sure why. I've never been this restless before a ceremony. I guess I'm feeling the first wave of inevitable fatigue. Although I don't feel sleepy, it's the only explanation I can come up with. It’s either that or I'm a lot more nervous than I thought about this dress. I’ve been anxiously walking back and forth the length of the space assigned as the waiting room, unable to keep my feet from moving. Intermittent to my pacing, I only allow myself to stop a few seconds—just long enough to examine my reflection in the long mirror. I don’t even recognize myself. As much as I pray that each step I take would somewhat calm down the rhythmic beating of my heart, it's to no avail.

On rare occasions, her prayers would be answered. The door of her bedroom would inch open, and an enchanted beam of light would cut across the floor, with Anthony Walsh’s silhouette appearing in the doorway. He would sit at the foot of her bed, leaving a little present on the bedspread for her to find in the morning. Her father would bring her a special memento that told the story of the trip he had taken—a doll from Mexico, a calligraphy brush from China, a small wooden figurine from Hungary, a bracelet from Guatemala. These were the hallowed treasures of Julia’s childhood.

Then her mother’s health had started to decline. The earliest episode Julia could recall took place at the movies on a Sunday. In the middle of the film, her mother looked at Julia and asked who had turned all the lights out. The holes in her mother’s memory grew insidiously. What began as confusion between the kitchen and the music room grew into frantic screams that the grand piano had disappeared."

Julia watched from behind the tall glass of the main terminal as a long mahogany casket descended the conveyor belt from the cargo hold and continued on toward the hearse parked nearby. An airport security officer came into the waiting room and called for her. Julia entered a minivan and was driven to the plane, accompanied by Adam, Stanley, and her father’s personal assistant, Wallace. A customs officer handed her an envelope containing some paperwork, a watch, and a passport.

Julia flipped through her father’s passport, eyes trailing over an array of stamps that told the story of Anthony Walsh’s final months on earth. Saint Petersburg, Berlin, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Saigon, and Sydney. A whole host of cities Julia had never seen. Destinations she could have only dreamed of discovering with her father.

While four men took care of formalities around the coffin, Julia thought of the long trips her father had always taken, all the way back to when she was just a little girl.

She remembered the endless nights spent waiting with bated breath for her father to come home to their Upper East Side town house."

The wind shifted to take us south and west. We were sailing further from land. Each change meant work for the boys. I saw that Sámr’s strength was a true asset. He was not yet ready to row but it would not be long for his chest was broad and, for his age, he was well muscled. He and Lars were the two strongest and they were the rocks upon which the others depended. We had no idea how long we sailed south and west. Erik and Aiden would have no idea where we were. The wind began to veer and we found ourselves sailing what appeared to be north and east. It was then that the Norns played one more trick. The ropes and the rigging had all been replaced before we left Whale Island but one of the forestays snapped.

Erik knew the danger. If we lost the mast and the sail then we were doomed."

I heard a roar as Olaf Leather Neck and Haaken led my warriors to smash into the men of Om Walum. Arrows still plucked men from their feet. The leader suddenly seemed to realise that he had not managed to surprise us. Perhaps he had thought that we were drunk. It was a common misconception amongst the men we fought. I know not the reason but the sudden attack had failed and failed disastrously. He shouted something and his men tried to disengage and run back to the cliffs. That was easier said than done. The jarl had been attacked and the Clan of the Wolf had vengeance in their hearts. Olaf led my men to purse them.

Aiden and Sámr appeared. I saw that Sámr had his Saami bow. As I wiped the blood from my sword on the kyrtle of the last man I had slain I pointed to the body with an arrow sticking from its skull."
B0735NBYD20,B0735NBYD2,"Now I was walking a very thin line between right and wrong. Now I was in that gray area that makes lawyers flail around in at least once in their careers. Now I was in that ambiguity that might get me sentenced to years in a federal prison for stealing a client's money. I stuffed my car keys in my pocket and climbed the stairs to the door that led into my laundry room and then into the kitchen. It was time to put these thoughts to rest. That money wasn't mine and there would never be a situation where I would touch a dime of it.

Never.

Not even if it got me arrested.

Really? Maybe I would need to consult a lawyer of my own about that. Maybe I shouldn't be the one making that decision at all because I was too close to it.

Maybe, maybe, maybe.

I went inside my house, hating myself and hating the practice of law. It would be good to see my partner, Verona, and allow her sweet love for me to make me whole again. To make me more than I really was.

That was something all the money in the world couldn't do.

It was love that could."
B0735NBYD21,B0735NBYD2,"It was a perverse little pleasure for me to think about the charge I'd just made on my American Express. Imagine what life would be like if it didn't ever matter to me ever again how much I charged to my card? That's what Gerry's money could mean to me. Or what if I wound up with only half of it? Maybe a fifty-fifty split with his kids? Would that be so bad?

Twenty minutes later I hit the garage door opener at my house and pulled inside my three-car garage. Verona's Range Rover was parked inside. I pulled alongside it and threw open my door.

What the hell? Thoughts like I'd been having on the way home were random and meant nothing. No way would I ever in real life abscond with a client's money. I just didn't do stuff like that.

But wait, I told myself. What if the FBI filed charges against me? What if they actually indicted me? Would it be okay in that case to use some of that money to defend myself in court? To hire a lawyer? After all, it was Gerry's money that might put me in that position in the first place. Shouldn't he be the one to pay for that problem if it ever arose?"

The man who had murdered Robert was in jail, but Gabe was certain some of the men riding tonight had taken place in the fateful raid. He wouldn’t mind a taste of justice.

The men rode as far as the gate and stopped. Gabe listened carefully, but could hear nothing of the conversation taking place because of the wind. He could tell there was an argument going on by the fact that several of the men were waving their hands, but there was no way to know if the argument was about attacking the plantation or leaving it alone. He glanced around at the thirty men waiting quietly in the cover of the trees. Without exception, these men were all veterans who had served under Moses or Mark Jones. They knew what to do and would not hesitate to do it —especially with their wives and children counting on them for protection.

Gabe cradled his rifle in his hands, ready for what may come. Suddenly, a lull in the wind allowed the conversation to be heard."

Once again, Granite ran like lightning. Once again, Carrie captured all three rings. She felt a thrill of accomplishment, but her attention was already on the next tilt as she cantered over to the starting line.

In the past, riders had prepared for tournaments with months of practice. None of today’s knights, except for Amber, had been able to do that. They had ridden for fun. Now, those who had failed in their quest were lined up along the arena fence, cheering on the remaining competitors.

There were only five riders left now —Earl, Susan, Amber, Catherine and Carrie. Earl looked surprised to still be in the field, but he was clearly eager to win. Carrie shared a grin of triumph with the remaining women competitors, and then turned her attention back to the list. She could almost hear Robert shouting her on to victory. Her mind told her he wasn’t in the crowd, but she couldn’t stop herself from scanning the faces just to be sure. She swallowed the tears back. Nothing could blur her vision."

Instead, she ignored them, walking toward the five-mast Tarkothi ship moored at the twenty-sixth berth.

Or was it the twenty-third berth? That’s what the sign at the head of the dock indicated. Had they taken the time and effort to move it three berths up overnight? The enormous black ship filled her visual field, and would have needlessly clogged up the harbor.

She walked up the dock to the gangplank. Two marines stood guard, cutlasses dangling at their sides. They looked too small to be soldiers, and their features were almost effeminate. Eldaeri, in all likelihood. The nine-pointed silver sun emblazoned on their crimson surcoats—

Crimson?

The Tarkothi livery had been forest green. Unless they’d moved the ship and dyed their wardrobes, this was the Serikothi ship bearing their Prince Koryn all the way from Tivara’s far east.

Gold needles protruded from points all over her body, throbbing and buzzing and blossoming as if her body hosted a fireworks display. It might as well have been one, given all the palace physicians who came and went, all bobbing their heads at Doctor Wu ’s wisdom. At least a dozen hands felt her pulses, and she had to stick her tongue out each time for their examination.

Had they been treating her themselves, they would have had to insert the needles blindfolded; but today, they held hand mirrors up to politely and indirectly see the points Doctor Wu had chosen. Not that it mattered; her lanky body might have just as easily belonged to a boy.

Not for long, though, if what Doctor Wu had said was right. And she was never wrong. Thank the Heavens. Maybe the news of her blossoming would stifle the rumors and jokes behind her back. Of course, it also meant her wedding to General Lu, or perhaps some rebellious Northern lord, might happen in less than a month. That future did not include Prince Hardeep or Dragon Songs.

Michael was about to pull back the curtain for one of the engineers. Welcome to Oz.

Mickey Leonov was top talent on their primary legitimate venture, a shoebox-sized drone that monitored pipelines for oil and gas companies. And being of Russian descent, he had an intuitive understanding of both the privilege of insiders and the perils of crossing the powers that be.

Mickey’s promotion wasn’t planned, but the failure in Versailles required immediate corrective action. More action than could be completed by the current crew before Ivan’s return. Michael wanted to retrofit Raven with improved offensive capabilities so that he could present the solution at the same time he revealed their shortcoming. Problem encountered, problem dispatched.

Ivan didn’t know about the debacle in Versailles yet. Having taken a page from the playbook of Russia’s previous president, he refused to discuss operations on the phone, even in code. He’d find out in person when he returned from California.

Michael, Boris and Pavel spent the drive back to the Côte d'Azur brainstorming fixes for Raven’s flaws. They arrived home with workable solutions and implementation was now underway.

Michael phoned down to the laboratory."
B076N5B7CJ1,B076N5B7CJ,"She’d put a pin on the one thing he didn’t have. Odd as it was for a man-of-mystery, Ivan dreamed of days filled with family and friends. He longed for a prestigious permanent address with personal photos on the wall. Club memberships and restaurants where they knew his assumed name.

Of course he also had much grander ambitions. He always had grander ambitions. He wouldn’t stop until schoolbooks included his name. Why was it that no matter what you had or what you’d achieved, you always wanted more?

Ivan drank his water and pushed whimsy from his mind. Time to revel in the moment. He’d just completed a major coup. One worth celebrating. He’d served revenge, clean and cold, to a man who had betrayed him. The Director of the CIA no less. And he’d framed his rival for it. He doubted there was another person on the planet who could have pulled that off. Not one of the seven billion.

He’d timed it perfectly as well. Crippling the CIA and forcing Achilles into hiding just when the world was about to need them most.

That called for a celebration.

If she wanted to be a doctor, she was going to spend her whole life surrounded by senseless pain and suffering. She would have to deal with it.

Sometime during that long morning, the sounds of battle ceased. Carrie had heard story after story of both valor and suffering. In the same voices, she heard both pride and agony. In the same eyes, she saw both courage and fear. In the same faces, she saw both determination and homesickness. And in her own heart, she was finding the way to deal with her fear and questioning about Robert.

As long as she gave wholeheartedly to the men filling the ward, she had no time to consider her own situation. She would always see Robert’s face on every gurney and hear Robert’s voice with every request for water. Although her fear that it might actually be him one day was terrifying, the comfort of helping those like him was the one redeeming factor. She knew the hospital would be her saving grace through the long months, and possibly years, ahead."

Soon the aroma of fresh bread would spread through the air, competing with the odor of soup made in the boilers taken from the tobacco factories down the hill. And of course, the brewery was turning out beer as fast as it could.

Rounding the corner, Carrie stopped suddenly and held her hand against her mouth, trying to control the gagging reflex in her throat. She stared in horror at the pile of severed hands, legs and arms piled outside one of the surgical buildings. Already the mound was attracting swarms of flies as it cast off its deathly odor. Carrie closed her eyes tightly and forced her legs to carry her past the awful scene. These buildings were full of young men who desperately needed medical help. Somehow she must block out her own feelings of helpless horror and give them hope.

Almost running when she finally reached her ward, Carrie took one deep breath and ducked into the building. Immediately, she was thankful Dr. McCaw had insisted on plenty of ventilation for all of the buildings. Even so, the air was thick and heavy."
B01CLFDCTC0,B01CLFDCTC,"He looked up from where he had been swabbing an area around the altar and raised a nitrile-gloved hand in greeting, gesturing that it was safe to enter in their plastic-covered shoes.

MacKenzie and Lowerson walked slowly along the main aisle of the church, past the rows of plain wooden pews, their eyes tracking the details of the room. She had lost count of the times she had seen Ryan silently observing a crime scene, eyes sharp, his senses consciously heightened as he committed it to memory and she followed his example.

The church itself was a boxy piece of nineteenth century architecture partly obscured by a few trees and a small boundary wall. It was certainly not the kind of ancient masterpiece one might have expected to find in an area famed for its historic buildings. Inside, there were no fancy touches. Spirituality without artifice, MacKenzie thought, as she noted the basic pews and functional font, the cork board displaying everyday, run-of-the-mill notices for those who happened to visit. She saw a glossy leaflet advertising the annual pilgrimage to the spot and wondered if their intake would be lower or higher next year, after this year’s excitement. That would be an interesting observation on human nature."
B01CLFDCTC1,B01CLFDCTC,"Her mascara wand paused mid-air while her head fell to one side, to allow him better access.

Just for this moment, she savoured the present and the simple joy of being alive.

CHAPTER 4

Detective Chief Superintendent Arthur Gregson checked his watch again and fidgeted beside the display of curtains in the home furnishings department of Fenwicks, the famous local department store in the centre of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Discreet lighting illuminated the handiwork and he fingered some fabric, picked up a few picture frames and sniffed at scented candles for a further five minutes while he waited with resentful impatience for the other half of his meeting to arrive.

Finally, he saw her weave through the stands of expensive vases and display bowls, looking very much at home beside the glinting china and polished glass. Professor Jane Freeman was, as always, dressed impeccably in tailored trousers and a cream silk shirt. Blonde, carefully highlighted hair framed her face in an attractive halo and she looked much younger than her forty-three years.

She came to a standstill beside him and her glacier blue eyes swept over his greying figure with ill-concealed contempt. Her lip curled at the display of roman blinds and she let out a quiet laugh."
B01M4GE64D0,B01M4GE64D,"But for now, the sky hung pale blue under the crowding clouds.

She walked by a couple of the little green Kias they provided to guests during their stay (on-property use only), then turned onto the narrow gravel road and saw no one.

Fields spread on either side, buried in snow. She spotted a trio of deer loping through it, white tails flashing, dark winter coats thick.

The cry of a hawk had her gaze lifting to watch it circle. Falconry ranked high on her three-year-plan for the resort, and she’d made progress in that area as she came to the end of year one.

The wind whipped snow off the ground, sent it swirling around her like sparkling dust while her boots rang on the iron-hard ground.

She spotted movement near the BAC, some of the staff out with a few of the horses in the sheltered paddock. The warm smell of horses carried to her, as did the scents of oiled leather, hay, and grain.

She lifted a hand in greeting as the man in the heavy barn coat and brown Stetson glanced over. Abe Kotter patted the paint mare he’d been brushing, then walked a few steps to meet Bodine."
B01M4GE64D1,B01M4GE64D,"His black hair had had a wave to it while hers ran ruler straight, but she had his high cheekbones, his small, pugnacious nose, and the white Irish skin that required oceans of sunscreen.

But she liked to think she’d inherited her grandmother’s canny business sense.

She went to the counter that held the pod machine that made tolerable coffee, took a mug to her desk to go over her notes for her first two meetings of the day.

As she finished up a phone call and an e-mail simultaneously, Jessica came in.

Like Maureen, Jessie wore a dress—a sharp red in this case, paired with a short leather jacket the color of top cream. The short, high-heeled boots wouldn’t last five minutes in the snow, but they matched the red dress as if they’d been dyed in the same batch.

Bodine had to admire the slick, unassailable style.

Jessica wore her streaked blond hair pulled back in a sleek coil as she often did on workdays. Like the boots, her lips matched the dress perfectly and suited her slashing cheekbones, her slim, straight nose, and her eyes of clear, glacier blue.

She sat as Bodine finished the call, taking her own phone out of her jacket pocket and scrolling through something.

Bodine hung up, sat back."
B00CH37J660,B00CH37J66,"Unless the lines were completely down, she’d call.

The flight from Florida to Jamaica was on a cargo plane. Less than twenty-four hours had passed since the tsunami hit the northern coast of the island, and the death toll was estimated in the thousands. There hadn’t been a tsunami of this nature on the shores of the island in recorded history. Even earthquakes were rare. There had been an earthquake in the ocean hours before the shaker hit the island, causing the tsunami to hit close behind the quake. It really didn’t matter how or why the devastation happened, it needed to be cleaned up and the suffering people needed help.

According to their team briefing, bodies were washing up on shore and those who survived filled the hospitals and clinics all over the island.

Earlier, Monica had attempted to sleep on the flight from LA to Miami but only managed about an hour. Even with the ear protection, the noise in the cargo plane was too difficult to think past to allow her brain to turn off and rest.

The conversation with John hummed in the back of her mind… but the conversation with her boss, Pat, was what really weighed on her mind."
B00CH37J661,B00CH37J66,"After grabbing an IV tray, Monica turned to make her way back into Gary’s room to begin the daunting task of finding a vein. She knew from experience the task wasn’t easy. Gary had been in some kind of fire several years before, leaving scar tissue over both arms and half his back.

At least the man had never been toxic with her. He didn’t come in cussing and fighting. He wasn’t a mean drunk, just a drunk. The age on his chart said forty-three, but he looked sixty.

A woman from medical records stepped up to the desk and started piling charts. It was routine for any returning patients to have their charts pulled and brought up. Monica recognized Gary’s overstuffed manila folder, which was a good four inches thick.

She picked up the chart and walked down the hall to Gary’s room. Each step built frustration with the man. She cautioned herself briefly before entering the room and closing the door behind her.

Gary sat with his legs dangling off the edge of the gurney. The blue and white spotted gown covered most of him.

He wouldn’t look at her.

Fine.

Monica set the IV tray down quietly on an overhead table and paused."
B01BCEPO580,B01BCEPO58,"None of us wore the fringes outside his trousers. The only element of uniform that we had in common was the small, black skullcap which we, too, wore.

They came up to the first-base side of the wire screen behind home plate and stood there in a silent black-and-white mass, holding bats and balls and gloves in their hands. I looked at them. They did not seem to me to present any picture of ferocity. I saw Davey Cantor kick again at the wire screen, then walk away from them to the third-base line, his hands moving nervously against his dungarees.

Mr. Galanter smiled and started toward them, moving quickly on the balls of his feet, his skullcap perched precariously on the top of his balding head.

A man disentangled himself from the black-and-white mass of players and took a step forward. He looked to be in his late twenties and wore a black suit, black shoes, and a black hat. He had a black beard, and he carried a book under one arm. He was obviously a rabbi, and I marveled that the yeshiva had placed a rabbi instead of an athletic coach over its team.

Mr. Galanter came up to him and offered his hand."
B01BCEPO581,B01BCEPO58,"I saw Davey Cantor kick nervously at the wire screen behind home plate, then put his hands into the pockets of his dungarees. His eyes were wide and gloomy behind his owlish glasses.

I watched them come into the yard.

There were fifteen of them, and they were dressed alike in white shirts, dark pants, white sweaters, and small black skullcaps. In the fashion of the very Orthodox, their hair was closely cropped, except for the area near their ears from which mushroomed the untouched hair that tumbled down into the long side curls. Some of them had the beginnings of beards, straggly tufts of hair that stood in isolated clumps on their chins, jawbones, and upper lips. They all wore the traditional undergarment beneath their shirts, and the tzitzit, the long fringes appended to the four corners of the garment, came out above their belts and swung against their pants as they walked. These were the very Orthodox, and they obeyed literally the Biblical commandment And ye shall look upon it, which pertains to the fringes.

In contrast, our team had no particular uniform, and each of us wore whatever he wished: dungarees, shorts, pants, polo shirts, sweatshirts, even undershirts. Some of us wore the garment, others did not."
B00TOT9LDA0,B00TOT9LDA,"It seemed bizarre that such nonsense could ever have interested him, and he watched a group of perfumed dandies strutting past with the highest contempt.

Their group dwindled as they passed on through the city. First Longfoot made his effusive farewells with much pressing of hands, talk of honours and privileges, and promises of reunion that Jezal suspected, and indeed rather hoped, were insincere. Near the great market square of the Four Corners, Quai was dispatched on some errand or other with all his habitual sullen silence. That left only the First of the Magi as a companion, with Ferro slouching angrily along behind.

Being honest, Jezal would not have minded had the group dwindled considerably further. Ninefingers might have proved himself a staunch companion, but the rest of the dysfunctional family would hardly have been among Jezal’s chosen dinner guests. He had long ago given up any hope that Ferro’s armour of scowls would crack to reveal a caring soul within. But at least her abysmal temper was predictable. Bayaz, if anything, was an even more unnerving companion: one half grandfatherly good humour, the other half who knew what? Whenever the old man opened his mouth Jezal flinched in anticipation of some ugly surprise.

But he chatted pleasantly enough for the time being."
B00TOT9LDA1,B00TOT9LDA,"The city was just as Jezal remembered it, and yet everything was different. The buildings seemed to have shrunk and huddled in meanly together. Even the wide Middleway, the great central artery of the city, felt horribly squashed after the huge open spaces of the Old Empire, the awe-inspiring vistas of ruined Aulcus. The sky had been higher, out there on the great plain. Here everything was reduced, and, to make matters worse, had an unpleasant smell he had never before noticed. He went with his nose wrinkled, dodging between the buffeting flow of passers-by with bad grace.

It was the people that were strangest of all. It had been months since Jezal had seen more than ten at one time. Now there were suddenly thousands pressed in all around him, furiously intent on their own doings. Soft, and scrubbed, and decked out in gaudy colours, as freakish to him now as circus performers. Fashions had moved on while he was away facing death in the barren west of the World. Hats were worn at a different angle, sleeves had swollen to a wider cut, shirt collars had shrivelled to a length that would have been thought preposterously short a year before. Jezal snorted to himself."
B079KYDVPR0,B079KYDVPR,"Next would come the careful decision-making process regarding the addition of milk; too much would bring down the temperature, and as Graham liked to think of it, risked muddling what the tea was attempting to express.

Finally, he would add just the right amount of sugar. Graham had taken pains to instruct the wait staff to ensure that it was available in loose, as well as cubed form, so that he might more carefully adjudicate its addition. He tipped an eighth of a teaspoonful into the cup and stirred nine times, counter-clockwise. Some things, as he was so fond of reminding his fellow police officers, are worth doing well. He chose to ignore their barely suppressed eye-rolls.

He took a sip and cherished the added bergamot that complemented the traditional Earl Grey flavor. But then, contrary to his usual practice, Graham set down the cup. An article on page six of the newspaper was demanding his attention. The headline was Our Cops are Tops, and he read on with a quiet flush of pride.

After their successes in recent months, it goes without saying that Gorey has the most capable police officers on the island. Led by the indefatigable Detective Inspector Graham, the Gorey Constabulary has successfully raised the rate at which it solves reported crimes from twenty-six percent, one year ago, to forty-nine percent, today."
B079KYDVPR1,B079KYDVPR,"The dining room was becoming busier by the week, but at least his favorite table by the window was still available on this bright Saturday morning. The White House Inn staff were busier than they had been since Christmas, welcoming and looking after new arrivals who had chosen to exchange the snow of Scotland or the dreary rain of Manchester for a few sunny days in Jersey. He took his seat and opened the morning paper, part of a reassuring and established routine he had enjoyably been following for the last six months.

As he settled into life on Jersey, Graham had followed the changing of the seasons as the island’s surprisingly mild winter gave way to an even warmer and quite invigorating early spring. By mid-March, the island was once again beginning to look its splendid and colorful best. The spring blooms were out. Swathes of bright yellow daffodils and the unmistakable, bell-shaped blue hyacinth dotted the island. Economically, Jersey had also started to blossom. Most of Gorey’s small fishing fleet had completed a month of refit and repair. Shortly, they would be heading out among the Channel Islands to catch lobster and oysters, or further into the Atlantic for cod."
B01AHKXIS80,B01AHKXIS8,"The noise was high-pitched and terrifying, and Darby sat up quickly. With a sinking heart, she remembered she was in the middle of a strange city, alone. Out the window, the sun had disappeared behind the horizon in a dull haze, lending an otherworldly glow to the rooftops and water towers.

The scream dissolved into helpless laughter as the racket outside her door increased. The Ford girls must have returned from their outing.

Darby got up and brushed her hair, then put on her favorite dress for courage. It was a creamy cotton that buttoned right up to the neck and had short, cuffed sleeves. The dress flowed out from the belted waist, from which dozens of images of closed umbrellas and parasols hung down among the many pleats. The varying shapes and colors made her smile whenever she looked down.

In the mirror, her face had a sallow cast and her brown hair hung limply in the heat, making her ears seem bigger than normal. The Ear Beautifier that Mother had ordered and insisted she use nightly hadn’t made them any less pronounced. Still, the dress was awfully pretty.

Taking a deep breath, Darby ventured into the hallway.

A gorgeous redheaded girl stopped mid-stride."
B01AHKXIS81,B01AHKXIS8,"Grand Central Terminal had frightened her to bits, the hordes of people walking this way and that, knowing exactly where they were headed and why. She had stood close to the big clock and clutched her suitcase, trying to get her bearings as if she were standing on the deck of a giant ship. The floor even seemed to sway ever so slightly under her black patent leather pumps.

Then she spied the sign for taxis and hurled herself toward it, bumping into people and apologizing furiously. Before she had a moment to watch the city whizzing by in the cab, she was dropped off in front of the Barbizon Hotel and found herself standing in the cool, cavernous lobby. The dark wood of an intricately carved balcony loomed over three sides, offset by bright white walls. Lush palm plants stood guard against the columns.

All she wanted, after the overnight train ride, with its fancy dining car and linen tablecloths, was to go to her room and lie down for a moment. To collect herself from the onslaught of sensations. And now they said she didn’t even have a room.

She knew no one in the city, no one at all. The Barbizon Hotel for Women was her only hope.

The clerk returned from a back room, clutching a white piece of paper."
B076VVZV740,B076VVZV74,"and then I was out and into thin air, far above the ground and falling.

Five

For a split second, I was in midair, arms pinwheeling as if that could somehow stop me from falling. I sprawled on my face on a wide sheet of ice. With a terrible cracking sound, the ice shifted beneath me. The wind was howling and hurling snow around me in enraged eddies and sulky swirls. The temperature was arctic and biting, stiffening my water-soaked clothes.

The ice continued its relentless popping and cracking as my weight settled onto it. White lines shot away from me like lightning bolts trapped in the ice. The water beneath the gelid surface was black, making the lake look like it was covered in black marble shot through with white veins. I lifted my head, and the ice made a sound like a gunshot.

Ahead of me, a barren rock island jutted toward the sky like the dorsal fin of a gargantuan, hunting shark. Sharp, ragged chunks of ice surrounded the little island like fangs, cutting me off with nature’s savage efficiency from the only land I could see. Not that I had any interest in being trapped on a barren island in the middle of an icy lake during a monstrous blizzard."
B076VVZV741,B076VVZV74,"Taking a longer, closer look, what I had taken to be a mirror-like silver was, in fact, thousands of rainbow colors, swirling and intertwining about each other, reflecting various frequencies of light. It was mesmerizing; it made me want to get closer and take a better look.

The rainbow-filled oval was about seven feet tall and three and a half feet wide at its widest point. It was big enough to walk through without stooping or slouching. It looked like a movie special effect for a science-fiction epic. The more I looked at it, the more it drew me forward.

I fought my way to my feet, feeling the fatigue in every fiber of my being. I had to get closer to the oval, whatever it was. I took two steps forward before I remembered my pack. I took two steps back to retrieve it, and those two steps felt like I was walking against an outgoing tide. I bent with a groan and grabbed the pack, slinging it on my back through sheer force of will. I stepped closer to the shimmer and could see my own reflection in its rainbow-colored surface. Standing that close, the pull coming off those gleaming colors was beyond my capacity to resist."
B071GJBSFP0,B071GJBSFP,"Above, on the paneled glass canopy, the rain danced, but soundlessly. At the far opposite side of the colonnade, a small group of people were gathered around a painting, too far away to notice or care about the complications of a momentarily thrown middle-aged priest.

To his right, through a semicircular arch whose Romanesque sturdiness jarred with the more delicately pointed Gothic-era arches of the arcade proper, was a vacant, unfurnished, low-ceilinged hall with a stone bench running along all three walls. He went in, as if the room had been his destination all along, and he took up a place on the bench, as if he had a right to be there.

Alone, he unzipped his jacket and put his books on the bench beside him. He resolved to block out the canned Gregorian chant, but then realized the ersatz music was sparing him the problem of a deadly silence: in holy silence, so the prophets say, men like him are supposed to hear the voice of God, but Kavanagh never heard a thing. He picked up his breviary again, and reflexively flipped the ribbon to the appointed page. He began to read the day’s Psalms as if he were a monk."
B071GJBSFP1,B071GJBSFP,"From clerestory windows above, the dull November light washed down on the several artworks that decorated the walls: artworks here, but once they had been consecrated altarpieces. Kavanagh recognized, because of the pictured staff and animal-skin cloak, a primitive portrait of John the Baptist, together with a rendering—the lion—of Saint Mark. Another woman sat at a desk in a corner, focused on pages under a gooseneck lamp. Several doorways led, multidirectionally, out of the hall, and Kavanagh chose one at random, having to stoop slightly as he passed through. He was startled to hear the atonal chanting of monks, just audible, as if coming from a nearby, closed-in chapel. But it was newfangled piped-in music, fake.

A short walk down a stone corridor—hung with a gruesome crucifix, a penitent Magdalene, and a sorrowful Madonna—led into a large rectangular enclosure organized around a glassed-in courtyard, a classic rendition of the ancient monastic hub. The quadrangle was defined by a long four-sided arcade that begged to be walked around. Originally, the space would have been open to the air, a garden for growing herbs and fruit, centered on a fountain. The limestone fountain was there, but dry, and the few potted plants suggested that most others had been taken to some greenhouse for the winter."
B076QLYB1J0,B076QLYB1J,"Screams, choked, hoarse... Cries for help...

Murderer. Demon.

No, that’s not me. Not anymore.

Maybe the king’s knights had come to take her away. Maybe they knew what she’d done.

No, no. It was in the past. That’s what Magister Galvan had told her. It was in the past, and she needed to look ahead.

The Tower was the safest place for her to be. The only safe place. The Tower would be her home now. Forever. Here, Magister Galvan would keep teaching her how to control her power. Here, stone walls kept her away from the surviving people she loved. Kept them alive. And they’d be safe from her. She swallowed.

The door flew open.

Brennan rushed toward her and gathered her in his arms. She melted into him, let him sweep her off her feet, breathed in the familiar spice of his scent, cinnamon and cypress. The eighteen-year-old noble was tall, handsome, her betrothed. And a werewolf—secret from everyone. Everyone but her.

After it all, she’d longed to see him more than anyone, and here he was at last. He’d come to her. He would understand, and with his love and support, she might live to stop hating herself someday."
B076QLYB1J1,B076QLYB1J,"Hopefully Jacqui wouldn’t over-water them, especially her peace lilies and bellina orchids. The bellinas were particularly temperamental.

A tent stood in the light of the campfire while he rummaged through their packs and pulled out two bedrolls.

He laid them down and disarmed for the night. Once finished, he hesitated a moment— she ducked behind her horse— and then he entered the tent.

A cold autumn wind made her shiver. She focused on the nearby shrubs, staring at the ripened purplish-red fruit of the common spindle, its lobes split open to reveal its bright orange seeds. Bold. Brave. Forthcoming.

With a deep breath, she checked the horses and the perimeter ward a final time, and when it started to rain, she spelled the fire to protect it and headed for the tent. A pause before the entrance to gather her composure, and she pulled the flap aside.

In the light of an oil lamp, he unrolled a bedroll, the other still bound and off to the side. When she came in, his gaze darted to hers for a moment, and then he resumed his task.

She sat and pulled off her boots. After picking up the remaining bound bedroll, he headed for the tent’s opening."
B01LQ646C40,B01LQ646C4,"She wondered if Thomas was warm, then sighed. More likely unbearably cold and lying in a trench. She understood from his early letters that the conditions weren’t great, even though as an officer he most likely had it better than some, but she hadn’t received a letter for months now, so she had no idea what it was like for him. He’d endured almost eighteen months before she’d met him when he was home on leave, but she still worried.

Looking around now that the station wasn’t so busy, she noticed other women, some alone, others with families. She tucked a loose strand of hair back behind her ear and took a slow, deep breath. What she needed to do was make a friend, someone to talk to, so she could stop worrying. Too much idle time, her mother had always said, was a very dangerous thing – although her mother would have preferred she fill it with socialising and ladylike pursuits – and the last few hours, even days, she’d had far too much time to think.

Scarlet was about to stand up when someone sat down next to her and stuck out a hand. She looked up into dark eyes and a huge smile."
B01LQ646C41,B01LQ646C4,"It was as if even the weather knew they were at war, it was so unseasonably cold. Scarlet had no idea where she would end up, but she doubted that anything about where she was going would seem familiar to her. Would she be able to sleep at night with the sounds of war so close? Would she be able to do her job, have a strong enough stomach for the wounds she knew she’d be tending? Scarlet swallowed a lump in her throat, digging her nails deeper into her palm as she walked.

She could do it. For Thomas, she could do it. Just like she’d already survived her military training on the outskirts of London that she’d been certain would kill her at the time.

The railway station was unbearably loud – too many people in a small space, the sound of a train pulling into the platform and being loaded until it was brimming with humans and baggage making Scarlet want to run. But she didn’t, because she’d left home now and she wasn’t going to run back to her parents and admit she’d been wrong.

She folded her arms tightly around herself, thankful for her warm coat as she found a bench to sit and wait on."
B0042XA3OE0,B0042XA3OE,"I was taken directly to the lunatic asylum, where I was consigned to lie in bed in my darkened room, day after day, week after week, month after month, with nothing to occupy my time but my daily torture and constant thoughts of my babies— I had no doubt they were living with Father and Mother. I did not know what had become of Harry and was haunted by thoughts of him … (Harry, my Harry, love of my life, father of my children, did Father reward you with pieces of gold to give me up to his ruffians in the middle of the night? Did you sell your own babies to him? Or did he simply have you murdered? Perhaps I shall never know the truth … )

All of my misery for the crime of falling in love with a common man. All of my heartbreak, torture, and punishment because I chose to bring you, my dearest children, into the world. All of my black and hopeless despair because I chose an unconventional life …

Ah, but surely nothing that has come before can be considered unconventional in light of where I am now going! Let me record the exact events that led me to be on this train: Two weeks ago, a man and a woman came into the ladies dayroom at the asylum."
B0042XA3OE1,B0042XA3OE,"I—and Father was inflexible and refused to even see me when I came to the house. I finally stopped going there altogether, and kept up only a tenuous contact with the family through my older married sister, also named Hortense.

By the time I gave birth to Willie, Harry and I had begun to have some difficulties. I wonder now if Father’s agents were already working on him, even then, for he seemed to change almost overnight, to become distant and remote. He began to drink and to stay out all night, and when he came home I could smell the other women on him. It broke my heart, for I still loved him. Still, I was more than ever glad that I had not married him.

It was on one such night when Harry was away that Father’s blackguards came. They burst through the door of our house in the middle of the night accompanied by a nurse, who snatched up my babies and spirited them away as the men restrained me. I fought them for all I was worth —screaming, kicking, biting, and scratching, but, of course, to no avail. I have not seen my children since that dark night."
B00MTSKHKO0,B00MTSKHKO,"Apparently the second weekend didn’t go so hot, with Mom walking out on Marriage Encounter and Dad when he reportedly stood before the entire gathering and quoted an Old Testament verse about the wife having to submit herself to the husband.

Now, it’s certainly possible that story about Mom’s weekend walkout is an exaggeration based on a couple of facts: My parents did leave the second weekend early and ended up staying a night in a Connecticut casino; while Dad famously found religion again when we were older, he (and we) did not attend church, Catholic or other, for many years prior to the attempted exorcism. I mention these facts in the interest of accuracy and context, and to point out that it’s possible his quoting the Bible didn’t actually happen even if enough people believe it did.

But I am not saying it isn’t probable that Dad quoted the offending verse at Mom, as it sounds totally like something he’d do. The rest of that particular story is easy to imagine: Mom storming away from the retreat cabin, Dad running to catch up with her, begging for forgiveness

and apologizing profusely, and then to make it up to her, taking her to the casino."
B00MTSKHKO1,B00MTSKHKO,"YouTube channels devoted to the show (and I have to confess to reading way more online stuff than I should). So all of it hopelessly jumbles up what I knew and what I know now.

In a way, my personal history not being my own, being literally and figuratively haunted by outside forces, is almost as horrible as what actually happened. Almost.

Let me give you a small example before we really start.

When I was four my parents attended two church-sponsored Marriage Encounter weekends. I’ve learned from second-third-fourth-hand accounts that Dad insisted they go with the hopes of getting them through a rough patch in their marriage and to rediscover God in their relationship and lives. Mom, at the time, was no longer Catholic or practicing any religion at all and was very much against the idea, but she still went. Why she went is subject to total speculation as she never told me or anyone else why. That I’m talking about it now would totally embarrass her. The first weekend went well enough with their A-frame cabin, walks in the woods, their group discussions, and dialogue drills; each couple would take turns writing down and then sharing their answers to questions concerning their marriage, with those questions framed within the context of some biblical lesson or text."
B00CBFYPQC0,B00CBFYPQC,"I shall have to get off the draining-board — Topaz wants the tea-cosy and our dog, Heloïse, has come in and discovered I have borrowed her blanket. She is a bull-terrier, snowy white except where her fondant-pink skin shows through her short hair. All right, Heloïse darling, you shall have your blanket. She gazes at me with love, reproach, confidence and humour — how can she express so much just with two rather small slanting eyes?

I finish this entry sitting on the stairs. I think it worthy of note that I never felt happier in my life — despite sorrow for father, pity for Rose, embarrassment about Stephen’s poetry and no justification for hope as regards our family’s general outlook. Perhaps it is because I have satisfied my creative urge; or it may be due to the thought of eggs for tea.

II

LATER. Written in bed.

I am reasonably comfortable as I am wearing my school coat and have a hot brick for my feet, but I wish it wasn’t my week for the little iron bedstead — Rose and I take it in turns to sleep in the four-poster. She is sitting up in it reading a library book."
B00CBFYPQC1,B00CBFYPQC,"I had a scholarship, just as Thomas has at his school; we are tolerably bright.

The rain is driving hard against the window now. My candle makes it seem quite dark outside. And the far side of the kitchen is dimmer now that the kettle is on the round hole in the top of the range. The girls are sitting on the floor making toast through the bars. There is a bright edge to each head, where the firelight shines through their hair.

Stephen has finished pumping and is stoking the copper — it is a great, old-fashioned brick one which helps to keep the kitchen warm and gives us extra hot-water. With the copper lit as well as the range, the kitchen is much the warmest place in the house; that is why we sit in it so much. But even in summer we have our meals here, because the dining-room furniture was sold over a year ago.

Goodness, Topaz is actually putting on eggs to boil! No one told me the hens had yielded to prayer. Oh, excellent hens! I was only expecting bread and margarine for tea, and I don’t get as used to margarine as I could wish. I thank heaven there is no cheaper form of bread than bread."
B005IQ2D9W0,B005IQ2D9W,"She died in her sleep after praying the rosary, when she was in her seventies, and two years later, Mama, the only baby still living out of the eight that Mother Lizbeth had borne, died when having Junior. Since it’s just us and Daddy here now with China, the chickens, and a pig when Daddy can afford one, the fields Papa Joseph used to plant around the Pit are overgrown with shrubs, with saw palmetto, with pine trees reaching up like the bristles on a brush.

We dump our garbage in a shallow ditch next to the pit, and we burn it. When the pine needles from the surrounding trees fall in and catch fire, it smells okay. Otherwise it smells like burnt plastic. I dumped the glass into the ditch, where it sparkled on top of the black remains like stars. The water in the pit was low; we hadn’t had a good rain in weeks. The shower we needed was out in the Gulf, held like a tired, hungry child by the storm forming there. When there’s good rain in the summer, the pit fills to the brim and we swim in it. The water, which was normally pink, had turned a thick, brownish red. The color of a scab. I turned around to leave and saw gold. Manny."
B005IQ2D9W1,B005IQ2D9W,"My eyes wanted to search for Manny so badly the want felt like an itch on my temple, but I kept walking.

My mama’s mother, Mother Lizbeth, and her daddy, Papa Joseph, originally owned all this land: around fifteen acres in all. It was Papa Joseph nicknamed it all the Pit, Papa Joseph who let the white men he work with dig for clay that they used to lay the foundation for houses, let them excavate the side of a hill in a clearing near the back of the property where he used to plant corn for feed. Papa Joseph let them take all the dirt they wanted until their digging had created a cliff over a dry lake in the backyard, and the small stream that had run around and down the hill had diverted and pooled into the dry lake, making it into a pond, and then Papa Joseph thought the earth would give under the water, that the pond would spread and gobble up the property and make it a swamp, so he stopped selling earth for money. He died soon after from mouth cancer, or at least that’s what Mother Lizbeth used to tell us when we were little. She always talked to us like grown-ups, cussed us like grown-ups."
B000OCXGZA0,B000OCXGZA,"I cheered with him when Kabul’s team scored against Kandahar and yelped insults at the referee when he called a penalty against our team. But Baba sensed my lack of genuine interest and resigned himself to the bleak fact that his son was never going to either play or watch soccer.

I remember one time Baba took me to the yearly Buzkashi tournament that took place on the first day of spring, New Year’s Day. Buzkashi was, and still is, Afghanistan’s national passion. A chapandaz, a highly skilled horseman usually patronized by rich aficionados, has to snatch a goat or cattle carcass from the midst of a melee, carry that carcass with him around the stadium at full gallop, and drop it in a scoring circle while a team of other chapandaz chases him and does everything in its power —kick, claw, whip, punch—to snatch the carcass from him. That day, the crowd roared with excitement as the horsemen on the field bellowed their battle cries and jostled for the carcass in a cloud of dust. The earth trembled with the clatter of hooves. We watched from the upper bleachers as riders pounded past us at full gallop, yipping and yelling, foam flying from their horses’ mouths.

At one point Baba pointed to someone."
B000OCXGZA1,B000OCXGZA,"When I had finished my mother’s books—not the boring history ones, I was never much into those, but the novels, the epics — I started spending my allowance on books. I bought one a week from the bookstore near Cinema Park, and stored them in cardboard boxes when I ran out of shelf room.

Of course, marrying a poet was one thing, but fathering a son who preferred burying his face in poetry books to hunting…well, that wasn’t how Baba had envisioned it, I suppose. Real men didn’t read poetry—and God forbid they should ever write it! Real men—real boys—played soccer just as Baba had when he had been young. Now that was something to be passionate about. In 1970, Baba took a break from the construction of the orphanage and flew to Tehran for a month to watch the World Cup games on television, since at the time Afghanistan didn’t have TVs yet. He signed me up for soccer teams to stir the same passion in me. But I was pathetic, a blundering liability to my own team, always in the way of an opportune pass or unwittingly blocking an open lane. I shambled about the field on scraggy legs, squalled for passes that never came my way."
B01D4O804G0,B01D4O804G,"During the interminable hours of bed rest, Dmitri pondered ways of ascertaining her feelings, then decided that he should give her a gift: something personal, something she would treasure. A book? He had no way of knowing what she had or had not read, and it felt rather a staid present. Jewellery? The family had more ostentatious gold and precious stones than he could ever afford. And then he thought back to the subject of their first-ever conversation and the answer came to him: he would get her a puppy.

He knew a St Petersburg breeder who had some gorgeous French Bulldogs. One of them would be perfect, but how would he get it to Tatiana? He wanted to watch her reaction on receiving the gift so he couldn’t simply have it delivered to the Alexander Palace.

That evening, the Tsarina’s lady-in-waiting Anna Vyrubova came by to straighten his pillows. She was a plump-faced kindly type, a friend with whom his mother often stayed when she came to St Petersburg for the social season, and she enquired after his family. Dmitri decided to ask her advice. Did she think it would be acceptable for him to buy a gift of a puppy for Grand Duchess Tatiana? He explained that he wished to surprise her.

Anna’s face lit up with pleasure."
B01D4O804G1,B01D4O804G,"What must it be like to grow up with such limitless wealth, Dmitri wondered? To have an elephant house and Chinese theatre in your garden, to be driven around in shiny new automobiles by uniformed chauffeurs, to be able to buy whatever your heart desired? Tatiana seemed an unspoiled girl, but the sheer grandeur of her upbringing must set her apart. He knew her clothes were made by French couturiers and her hats shipped from a fashionable store in London; that her perfume came from Brocard & Co and her shoes from Henry Weiss. He had often noticed deliveries arriving by special messenger. Although he was the son of an army general, a member of a well-connected upper-class family, surely he couldn’t ever hope to become close to Tatiana? It was impossible, wasn’t it?

He watched the clock, wondering what time she would arrive. The previous day it had been mid morning when she stopped by his bed. He managed to eat some breakfast and had his dressing changed by the moustached nurse. She brought him a bowl of water and a razor and he shaved then combed his hair, keen to look presentable for Tatiana’s visit.

She bounced in at ten, her cheeks flushed from hurrying, three books tucked under her arm."
B01BBYK2JM0,B01BBYK2JM,"The pinprick quickly grows, as if engorging itself, the deep red streak soon trailing down to the bottom of the robe. Below is now only dusty earth, which scatters as drops fall onto it. One of the other figures looks down and sees that her robe too is now drenched in the blood of abandonment. She throws her head back, displaying a mouth lined with dark decaying teeth, and lets out a scream that drowns out all other noise. Then the third figure screams too, his robe now also soaked red, his skin dirty and pallid, his eyes grey and hollow above cheekbones jutting towards the sky.

The sky.

The sky has now turned from a white heavenly fog to a bluish- grey mist, and then it changes further to a murky black all-encompassing cloud fractured with crimson shards of lightning.

All three figures come closer still, asking her again, and although she wants to speak to them a presence grabs her around her neck and locks her throat.

The first figure, his face now filthy and purulent, pulls apart the top of his robe to expose a torso that barely has substance – flesh that has been eaten away from the inside, and sallow skin, ravaged by scabs and rashes, pulled taut over bones."
B01BBYK2JM1,B01BBYK2JM,"Then the figures slowly appear from the clear light – figures so bright they are the light – approaching her effortlessly as if riding a celestial wave. She has known them a long time, but they are beyond reach, and also beyond the world of pain and suffering. Her heart aches at being near them, and feelings of love are elevated to an intensity she finds exhilarating.

They wear white robes that are plain in design yet shimmer in the immaculate brightness. The light refracting along the edges of their garments creates a spectrum like no other – hazy and ethereal but somehow also vibrant and scintillating.

She hears them all mention her name and they smile astral smiles.

And then they ask her.

She wills them to come closer – to where they belong – and as they approach she sees each one has skin as flawless as a sea of sand, and silky hair that flows like a lion’s mane.

She has experienced this before, but now something is different: a sense of immediacy. Sometimes there are four or five of them; this time there are only three – the three tied by blood.

Blood – a pinprick appears on the clean white robe of one of them, and his smile falters as he looks down."
B01LX2JQYB0,B01LX2JQYB,"A faint easterly breeze was blowing, and the air held a pleasant chill. I bought an orange-flavored soda from a street vendor and continued walking till I got to Magen David Square. I had a few hours to burn, so I purchased a bunch of newspapers, sat at a bench, and read them through.

In the United Nations Security Council, Egypt was promoting a proposal for the demilitarization of Jerusalem. In Haifa, during a brawl in a café, an Arab pulled out a gun and shot a soldier in the leg. The Arab was still at large. The Kingdom of Transjordan was said to look favorably on the possibility of cooperating with Israel on various development projects in the Jordan Valley. Two hundred and forty Romanian Jews were stuck in the port of Constanta, awaiting approval from the Romanian government to board a ship that would take them to Israel. The Jews were said to be without food and shelter. Following the USSR, Poland had recognized the German Democratic Republic. In Guatemala, over a thousand people died due to heavy rains and flooding.

I left the newspapers on the bench and went home to get ready for what I had to do later that night."
B01LX2JQYB1,B01LX2JQYB,"I smiled and sat across from him.

This exchange of jabs and insults regarding the food each of us had grown up with was something we had been doing since shortly after we met. Reuben took great pride in Yemenite food and found it humorous that I had trouble handling some of the spicier dishes he enjoyed. For my part, my praise for Hungarian cuisine was feigned. I had to admit that there was little contest. Yemenite food was far superior to Hungarian.

I asked him how his wife, Gila, and his children were, and he beamed when he spoke of them. He had four children and they were all fine and healthy. He told me a little about each, and from the sound of it, he wouldn't have minded having a fifth in the near future. We talked a little about how things were slowly improving now that the war was officially over, and he spoke with great emotion about the thousands of Yemenite Jews that were arriving by the week to Israel. Apparently, there were many distant relatives of his among them.

Finally, we ran out of mundane things to talk about, and he asked what brought me to his office."
B071JXWXGS0,B071JXWXGS,"If only she had the funds or the lineage. She turned back, taking the hill with small careful steps, until she reached the junction. Although the right-hand road had seemed to go in entirely the wrong direction, it soon turned and she found herself dropping down into Arisaig.

There were a few people in bright raincoats and walking boots milling around the entrance to a building called the Land, Sea and Isles Centre, but mainly Stella saw what she assumed to be locals. A couple of pensioners sitting on a bench looking out at the sea loch had a Thermos flask with a green tartan pattern and a small dog tucked halfway inside the woman’s coat.

Stella paused at the lochside and tried to feel something. She was in a wild and beautiful place, she told herself. Having an adventure. There was an expanse of water and the islands of Eigg, Rùm and Skye in the distance. Stella could see that it was a good view, if you weren’t all that interested in colour. A wind sprang up, finding its way under her collar, and she turned from the water and trudged back up the hill to the main road."
B071JXWXGS1,B071JXWXGS,"Clinging to the slope were the assorted houses of the village, and down near the edge of the water, across the curve of the loch, sat a large white building with several roof peaks and big windows.

Arisaig wasn’t going to win any awards for size, but as the sun brightened, it suddenly looked precious and inviting. Then the clouds closed again and the landscape was pitched into gloom. It was a ridiculous place, Stella thought. Dual personality. But that fleeting glimpse of light on water had given an inkling of its charms.

At a T-junction, Stella hesitated. Having seen the village from above, she knew she must be heading down and towards the water, so she took the left-hand fork, following the road down a slope which became very steep, tipping Stella’s feet forward in her trainers. The edges of the road closed in, thick with rhododendrons and birch, until the sky was just a narrow slice and the temperature dropped. The road twisted until Stella wasn’t sure she was still headed in the right direction, and then, abruptly, the view opened wide.

Stella looked down onto the slated roof of a beautiful grey stone house. It was grand in size and style, with stepped gables and little turrets and several tall chimney stacks. Beyond it, the sea stretched out until it merged with the sky."
B0036S4CPW0,B0036S4CPW,"Or she could have paid a lot to make it look like she paid a little.

She walked up, eyed the crowd across the terminal, and then chose a spot ten or fifteen feet away on the floor. I watched her out of the corner of my eye. Dark pantsuit, a leather attaché, and one carry-on. Looked like she was returning from a business overnight. She set down her bags, tied on a pair of Nike running shoes, then, eying the terminal, sat on the floor and stretched. Based on the fact that not only her head, but also her chest and stomach could touch her thigh and the floor between her legs, I surmised that she had done that before. Her legs were muscular, like an aerobics instructor’s. After she stretched a few minutes, she pulled several yellow legal pads from her attaché, flipped through pages of handwritten notes, and started typing on her laptop. Her fingers moved at the speed of hummingbird wings.

After a few minutes, her laptop beeped. She frowned, stuck her pencil between her teeth, and began eyeballing the wall for an outlet. I was using half. She was holding the swinging end of her laptop’s power cord."
B0036S4CPW1,B0036S4CPW,"Many doctors buy Porsches and big homes and pay for country club memberships they seldom use. I take long runs on the beach and climb mountains when I can get to them.

I’d been gone a week.

My return trip took me from Colorado Springs to Salt Lake for the direct flight home. Airline travel never ceases to amaze me; flying west to end up east. The crowd in the airport had thinned. Most folks were home by this time on a Sunday. Those still in the airport were either at their gate, waiting, or at the bar, hovering over a beer and a basket of nachos or hot wings.

Her walk caught my attention. Long, slender legs; purposeful gait, yet graceful and rhythmic. Comfortable, and confident, in her own skin. She was maybe five foot nine or ten, dark-haired, and attractive, but not too concerned about it. Maybe thirty. Her hair was short. Think Winona Ryder in Girl, Interrupted. Or Julia Ormond in Harrison Ford’s remake of Sabrina. Not a lot of fuss, yet you could find the same style up and down Manhattan with girls who’d paid a lot of money to look like that. My bet was that she had paid very little."
B000GCFBTW0,B000GCFBTW,"He started to lose his balance, the sort of thing we all might do on any given day while walking through the city, trip on a crack in the sidewalk and take a couple of quick steps to regain equilibrium, but William Creek took only one step. Back. Off the curb.

You can’t really sugarcoat it at this point, can you? The number forty-one bus creamed him. He flew a good fifty feet through the air before he hit the back window of a SAAB like a great gabardine sack of meat, then bounced back to the pavement and commenced to ooze fluids. His belongings—the satchel, the umbrella, a gold tie bar, a Tag Heuer watch —skittered on down the street, ricocheting off tires, shoes, manhole covers, some coming to rest nearly a block away.

Charlie stood at the curb trying to breathe. He could hear a tooting sound, like someone was blowing a toy train whistle— it was all he could hear, then someone ran into him and he realized it was the sound of his own rhythmic whimpering. The guy—the guy with the umbrella—had just been wiped out of the world. People rushed, crowded around, a dozen were barking into cell phones, the bus driver nearly flattened Charlie as he rushed down the sidewalk toward the carnage. Charlie staggered after him."
B000GCFBTW1,B000GCFBTW,"He was thirty-two and worked as a market analyst in the financial district, where he had been headed that morning when he decided to stop at the auto-teller. He was wearing a light wool suit and running shoes, his work shoes were tucked into a leather satchel under his arm. The handle of a compact umbrella protruded from the side pocket of the satchel, and it was this that caught Charlie’s attention, for while the handle of the umbrella appeared to be made of faux walnut burl, it was glowing a dull red as if it had been heated in a forge.

Charlie stood in the ATM line trying not to notice, trying to appear uninterested, but he couldn’t help but stare. It was glowing, for fuck’s sake, didn’t anyone see it?

William Creek glanced over his shoulder as he slid his card into the machine, saw Charlie looking at him, then tried to will his suit coat to expand into great manta-ray wings to block Charlie’s view as he keyed in his PIN number. Creek snatched his card and the expectorated cash from the machine, turned, and headed away quickly toward the corner.

Charlie couldn’t stand it any longer. The umbrella handle had begun to pulsate red, like a beating heart."
B01CVYFYKI0,B01CVYFYKI,"As he got closer to her, he realised that the woman was younger than he had first supposed. She was perhaps twenty, while her accent and bearing suggested she came from a refined background.

' Enough of that!' He tried to inject authority into his voice. ' Leave that woman be.'

Pete put one arm around the woman's throat and the other round her waist. ' What has it to do with you?' His eyes were flat, poisonous, 'who the hell are you?'

Jack tried to stare the man down. ' I am Ensign Jack Windrush,' he said grandly, 'and I order you to leave that woman alone and return to barracks.'

'A bloody boy soldier,' the crop-headed redcoat said, 'a babe fresh from the cradle. Piddle off home to your mama, Ensign Jack Windrush, and don't interfere with men's work.'

'It's no work for a man to bully a defenceless woman.' As soon as Jack said the words he knew he sounded like a school prefect rather than an officer who held the Queen's Commission.

Pete laughed and planted a rough kiss on the woman's lips, which brought a cheer from his companions. The woman tried to push him away, her eyes now desperate as she looked at Jack."
B01CVYFYKI1,B01CVYFYKI,"He stepped on a prone policeman as he approached the woman. ' Want a real man do you?'

The woman did not back away. ' There are ten of you attacking three policemen,' she said, 'that is an ill game.' She looked from one soldier to the other, perhaps hoping for support or sympathy, but finding neither. Her voice rose, 'I think you should all return to your barracks.'

' Oh, that's what you think is it?' The gaunt soldier pressed his face against hers as his companions gathered around, encouraging him with animal sounds and gestures.

'Go on, Pete, you show her.'

Pete put a hand on the woman's shoulder and pushed her back; she staggered, and her bonnet fell off. Large boots trampled it underfoot.

' Take your hands off me,' her voice was high now as her confidence drained away.

'I'll put my hands wherever I bloody well choose,' Pete grabbed her shoulder and pulled her close. ' Come on boys; let's have a little fun here.'

Jack had been watching, hoping that the situation would resolve itself without the need for him to become involved, but now he left the shelter of the pub doorway and strode across the street."
B06XZC7R4L0,B06XZC7R4L,"Gehlen had later explained that von Deitelberg had been his deputy in Abwehr Ost until Gehlen had decided that the SS-Brigadeführer’s loyalty was not to the Wehrmacht, but rather to Heinrich Himmler and the SS. He had then assigned von Deitelberg to General von Paulus’s Sixth Army, then attacking Stalingrad.

Realizing that Stalingrad was going to be a disaster, and that Germany was going to lose the war, von Deitelberg had changed sides before von Paulus had to surrender. He had been taken into the NKGB with the equivalent rank to SS-Sturmführer and subsequently promoted.

It was clear to both Gehlen and Cronley that he was the man behind the kidnapping operations, and equally clear he was not about to tell them anything that could be believed about its purpose. And it was also equally clear that the NKGB probably would want him back, both because of his rank and to learn what he had told Gehlen and the DCI while they had him.

He was taken to the Glienicke Bridge at the hour Serov had specified for the Mattingly–Likharev exchange.

As Janice Johansen snapped pictures of everything, Lazarus got out of a Ford staff car. Cronley led him to the white line in the center of the bridge, where Ivan Serov waited for them, standing before the open door of a truck in which Colonel Mattingly sat chained to a chair."
B06XZC7R4L1,B06XZC7R4L,"He said that Mattingly would be on the Glienicke Bridge, which connected the Russian Zone of Occupied Berlin with the American Zone, two weeks later at nine in the morning. If the Americans showed up there with NKGB colonel Sergei Likharev, his wife, Natalia, and their young sons Sergei and Pavel, an exchange could be made.

Serov explained that it was important, pour encourager les autres, that Likharev, who had been captured attempting to make contact with a mole in the Gehlen Organization, and turned by Cronley, be returned to Russia. Likharev and his family—Gehlen’s agent in Russia had gotten Likharev’s family out of their Leningrad apartment to Thuringia in East Germany, where Cronley and Kurt Schröder, who had been Gehlen’s pilot in Russia, picked them up in Storch aircraft —were now in Argentina.

Cronley had left the Drei Husaren restaurant rather desperate. He had no intention of swapping the Likharevs for Mattingly. He knew what Serov had in mind for him and his family. They would be examples to other NKGB officers of what happened to NKGB officers and their families who tried to switch sides. And Colonel Likharev, according to Oscar Schultz, who had flown to Argentina to meet him, had lived up to his side of the bargain."
B001NLL5AO0,B001NLL5AO,"Before the first bell, the pair of boys would take the flag from its triangle-shaped rack in the office and head to the pole in front of the school. There they’d carefully unfold it, making sure no part of it touched the ground, since a flag desecrated in such a way was immediately burned. That was the story anyway; neither Henry nor any other kid in recent memory had ever known of such a thing actually occurring. But the threat was legendary. He pictured Vice Principal Silverwood, a blocky harrumphing old bear of a man, burning the flag in the parking lot while shocked faculty looked on—then sending the bill home with the clumsy boy responsible. His parents surely would be shamed into moving to the suburbs and changing their names so no one would ever find them.

Unfortunately Chaz Preston and Denny Brown, who were on flag duty, were not likely to move away any time soon, regardless of what they did. Both were from prominent local families. Denny’s father was a lawyer or a judge or something, and Chaz’s family owned several apartment buildings downtown. Denny was no friend of Henry’s, but Chaz was the real menace. Henry always thought Chaz would end up as his family’s bill collector. He liked to lean on people. He was so mean the other bullies feared him."
B001NLL5AO1,B001NLL5AO,"Over the past few months, he’d learned to shut his mouth and ignore the heckling—especially from bullies like Will Whitworth, Carl Parks, and Chaz Preston.

And Mrs. Beatty, the lunch lady, wasn’t much help either. A gassy, hairnet-wearing definition of one of Henry’s favorite American words: broad. She cooked by hand, literally, measuring everything in her dirty, wrinkled mitts. Her thick forearms were evidence that she’d never used an electric mixer. But, like a kenneled dog that refuses to do its business in the same place it sleeps, she never ate her own handiwork. Instead, she always brought her lunch. As soon as Henry laced up his apron, she’d doff her hairnet and vanish with her lunch pail and a pack of Lucky Strikes.

Scholarshipping in the cafeteria meant Henry never made it out to recess. After the last kid had finished, he’d eat some canned peaches in the storage room, alone, surrounded by towering stockpiles of tomato sauce and fruit cocktail.

Flag Duty

(1942)

Henry wasn’t sure which was more frustrating, the nonstop taunting in the school cafeteria or the awkward silence in the little Canton Alley apartment he shared with his parents. Still, when morning came, he tried to make the best of the language barrier at home as he went about his normal routine."
B004AM5R200,B004AM5R20,"I knew his wife, who lived in New Orleans, and knew the state of desperation she would suffer when the body was discovered. But more than sorrow for her, I felt pain that she would never know what had happened, that her husband had not been found drunk on the road by robbers. As we beat the body, bruising the face and the shoulders, I became more and more aroused. Of course, you must realize that all this time the vampire Lestat was extraordinary. He was no more human to me than a biblical angel. But under this pressure, my enchantment with him was strained. I had seen my becoming a vampire in two lights: The first light was simply enchantment; Lestat had overwhelmed me on my deathbed. But the other light was my wish for self-destruction. My desire to be thoroughly damned. This was the open door through which Lestat had come on both the first and second occasion. Now I was not destroying myself but someone else. The overseer, his wife, his family. I recoiled and might have fled from Lestat , my sanity thoroughly shattered, had not he sensed with an infallible instinct what was happening. Infallible instinct …"
B004AM5R201,B004AM5R20,"This proved without doubt the most difficult part for me. I’ve told you I had no fear regarding my own death, only a squeamishness about taking my life myself. But I had a most high regard for the life of others, and a horror of death most recently developed because of my brother. I had to watch the overseer awake with a start, try to throw off Lestat with both hands, fail, then lie there struggling under Lestat’s grasp, and finally go limp, drained of blood. And die. He did not die at once. We stood in his narrow bedroom for the better part of an hour watching him die. Part of my change, as I said. Lestat would never have stayed otherwise. Then it was necessary to get rid of the overseer’s body. I was almost sick from this. Weak and feverish already, I had little reserve; and handling the dead body with such a purpose caused me nausea. Lestat was laughing, telling me callously that I would feel so different once I was a vampire that I would laugh, too. He was wrong about that. I never laugh at death, no matter how often and regularly I am the cause of it."
B0788Y79LR0,B0788Y79LR,"The lumbering beast pulled at the hard grasses, chewing down great clumps, grinding them up with its fist-sized molars, and then moving on to the next. Its path led it towards two tree trunks only six feet apart, and rather than go around, it wedged its huge bulk between them and relied on its powerful stump-like legs to pull it through.

The tree trunks and canopies shook, and from above rained down hundreds, possibly thousands, of spindly red ants in defense of their nest. The inch-long insects had spikes on their heads that resembled horned helmets, and upon alighting on the body of the perceived threat to their colony, they immediately commenced their attack.

Formic acid was injected, magnifying the pain from the countless bites, and then the insects began to swarm towards the head where they had learned that the massive, thick-hided beasts were vulnerable. They quickly found the tiny eyes, ears, nostrils, and also the soft inner tissue in the mouth.

The Ankylosaurus screamed with fear and pain and charged forward. Its bulk smashed trees from its path, and its cries reverberated through the jungle, silencing the other chattering, skittering, and squealing inhabitants. Winged creatures took flight above it as it found a watercourse and charged along it."

To whom it may concern,

You may now be aware that Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle has now passed away, and we have been charged with tidying up his affairs. Many items of Sir Arthur’s collection will be kept for posterity, some will be provided to museums, and some he had wished returned to their owners on his demise.

One such item was to be the leather-bound notebook of the late Benjamin Bartholomew Cartwright of Ohio, United States of America. This notebook was something Sir Arthur valued immensely and always wished to hand-deliver back to its owner, Mr. Cartwright. Obviously, events overtook both parties before this outcome could be satisfactorily achieved.

Unfortunately, our searches to date have not located the item referred to in previous correspondence. Should knowledge of its whereabouts come to light then this letter will serve as proof of ownership for a Cartwright heir to take possession of the notebook in person.

Yours sincerely,

B000FBFM9S0,B000FBFM9S,"So this is what it feels like when some bugger saves your life. Like you’ve just been handed a great big wad of Time. He drove straight past his flat, straight past the street signs (Hendon 3¾ miles), laughing like a loon. At the traffic lights he flipped a ten-pence coin and smiled when the result seemed to agree that Fate was pulling him toward another life. Like a dog on a leash round a corner. Generally, women can’t do this, but men retain the ancient ability to leave a family and a past. They just unhook themselves, like removing a fake beard, and skulk discreetly back into society, changed men. Unrecognizable. In this manner, a new Archie is about to emerge. We have caught him on the hop. For he is in a past-tense, future-perfect kind of mood. He is in a maybe this, maybe that kind of mood. When he approaches a forked road, he slows down, checks his undistinguished face in the rearview mirror, and quite indiscriminately chooses a route he’s never taken before, a residential street leading to a place called Queen’s Park. Go straight past Go! , Archie-boy, he tells himself; collect two hundred, and don’t for Gawd’s sake look back."

Strangely, Daria was the final pulse of thought that passed through Archie just before he blacked out. It was the thought of a whore he met once twenty years ago, it was Daria and her smile that made him cover Mo’s apron with tears of joy as the butcher saved his life. He had seen her in his mind: a beautiful woman in a doorway with a come-hither look; and realized he regretted not coming hither. If there was any chance of ever seeing a look like that again, then he wanted the second chance, he wanted the extra time. Not just this second, but the next and the next —all the time in the world.

Later that morning, Archie did an ecstatic eight circuits of Swiss Cottage traffic circle in his car, his head stuck out the window, a stream of air hitting the teeth at the back of his mouth like a windsock. He thought: Blimey."
B01EE0CRKW0,B01EE0CRKW,"Coupled with a detector that adjusts the level according to how dark it is outside. It’s the same technology that makes your car headlights come on at night. Then you just choose the mood you want from the app. Productive, Peaceful, Playful, and so on. It even adds extra UV in the winter so you don’t get depressed. You know, like those SAD lights.

I can see Simon is so impressed by all this that the right of the architect to ban flat-pack furniture is suddenly no longer an issue.

The heating’s underfloor, obviously, the agent continues, sensing he’s on a roll. But it draws heat from a borehole directly under the house. And all these windows are triple-glazed — the house is so efficient, it actually returns power to the National Grid. You’ll never pay a fuel bill again.

This is like someone reciting porn to Simon. And the security? I say sharply.

All on the same system, the agent says. You can’t see it, but there’s a burglar alarm built into the outside wall. All the rooms have sensors—the same ones that turn the lights on. And it’s smart. It learns who you are and what your usual routine is, but anyone else, it’ll check with you to make sure they’re authorized."
B01EE0CRKW1,B01EE0CRKW,"Notches running along the base of each wall give the impression they’re floating in the air. And it’s empty. Not unfurnished— I can see a stone table in a room to one side, some designery-looking, very cool dining chairs, a long, low sofa in a heavy cream fabric — but there’s nothing else, nothing for the eye to catch on to. No doors, no cupboards, no pictures, no window frames, no electric sockets that I can see, no light fittings or— I look around, perplexed—even light switches. And, although it doesn’t feel abandoned or unlived in, there’s absolutely no clutter.

Wow, I say again. My voice has an odd, muffled quality. I realize I can’t hear anything from the street outside. The ever-present London background noise of traffic and scaffolding riggers and car alarms has gone.

Most people say that, the agent agrees. Sorry to be a pain, but the landlord insists we remove our shoes. Would you…?

He bends down to unlace his own flashy footwear. We follow suit. And then, as if the stark, bare emptiness of the house has sucked all his patter out of him, he simply pads about in his socks, apparently as dumbstruck as we are, while we look around."
B079CZY3ZM0,B079CZY3ZM,"Lucy smiled gratefully at me and then handed me a list on a fluro post-it note.

I drove around to the nearby supermarket. I blinked in surprise. I’d never seen the carpark that empty during business hours before. It was normally teeming with cars and people. I parked right up near the doors, and started to wonder if the place was even open, but as I sat in my idling car the automatic doors opened and a man came out with a trolley full of groceries.

I walked in. The shelves evidently hadn’t been restocked overnight like they usually were. Either that or they’d been super busy that morning, but I somehow doubted it judging by the carpark. Stock was running low in some of the aisles, but I managed to get everything on Lucy’s list even if it wasn’t the brand she usually got, and grabbed a few things for myself as well, wondering how long this strangeness was going to last. If it was anything like the normal flu, it could be weeks before people got better and things went back to normal. I shuddered at the thought. The fact that things would never go back to normal didn’t even cross my mind."
B079CZY3ZM1,B079CZY3ZM,"The beautiful morning had disappeared into a gloomy, grey day. I took the car.

Chapter Four

I knocked on the front door. The heavy thud of paws raced up to the door and barking started up on the other side. I stood there for a moment, but couldn’t hear anything other than Maggie barking. My foot tapped impatiently. I knocked again. Maggie’s barking grew deeper and more insistent. Both of their cars were sitting in the driveway, so I knew they were home. If they’d walked anywhere they would have taken Maggie.

I’d just decided to go and get the spare key from under the secret brick when I heard Alan shushing Maggie. I breathed a sigh of relief when he opened the door. Alan grabbed hold of Maggie’s collar so the huge Bernese Mountain dog couldn’t barrel past him. She wagged her tail happily when she realised the stranger at the door was me.

My relief didn’t last long. I took a proper look at Alan. He looked terrible. His normally neat hair was all mussed up, dark shadows surrounded his eyes, and I wasn’t sure if I was imagining it or not, but his eyes looked a little bloodshot. He blinked blearily at me."
B0722TJN5P0,B0722TJN5P,"The kill stroke for the woman had been one of two blows to her head, either to her left zygomatic or to the parietal on the same side. The woman’s left pupil had dilated to a wide black saucer. Moss noticed that the boy’s fingernails had been removed, all of them. And his toenails, too, it looked like. She checked the woman and found that her nails had been removed as well. Someone—a man, no doubt—had killed these people, then knelt in the gore to pluck their nails from them. Or had he taken their nails before he’d killed them? Why had he done that? One of the technicians ran lengths of thread from the blood spatter on the ceiling and walls, creating a web of thread that delineated an area of convergence—it looked like the victims had been on their knees when they were struck, an execution. The room they had died in was bland, tasteless— nothing like the room Moss had once known, the comfortable, cavelike rec room kept by her best friend’s family. Oatmeal tones now, track lighting. Nothing on the walls, no artwork, no photographs; the room didn’t look lived in, it looked staged for resale."
B0722TJN5P1,B0722TJN5P,"A nervous anticipation roiled Moss in the moments before her first view of a new crime scene; once she turned the corner and saw what she was dealing with, however, her nervousness dissipated, replaced by an urgent and sorrowful compulsion to reassemble the broken pieces as quickly as possible.

A boy and a woman lay on the floor, their faces smeared away in a mince of brain and blood and whorls of bone. Flannel pants on the boy, a jersey for a nightshirt — ten or eleven years old, Moss guessed. The woman’s nightgown was filthy with blood, her bare legs shading to plum where lividity had discolored her. Both had voided their bowels, the floor so sopped that shit and standing blood had pooled in the uneven runnels of the carpeting. The odors gagged her. The smells of the boy and his mother degraded them, she thought, their humanity debased by sewage stink and formlessness.

Moss had long ago learned the dissociative technique of viewing bodies through different lenses, divorcing the mutilation as much as possible from the personalities they once were—seeing her colleagues around her through the lens of humanity, seeing the bodies through the lens of forensics. Moss objectified the corpses."
B079SSPBB50,B079SSPBB5,"The footsteps ended, and the room grew so silent that Grant thought the hammer of his heart would give his position away. The silence lingered, stretching ten, twenty, forty seconds. Grant fought the impulse to move, to check, to give any sign that he was in the room. It was a waiting game for the rat now, and when the silence passed to well over a minute, Grant knew the rat was well practiced.

Another footstep, and Grant felt himself release a breath, which he quickly ended as another footstep sounded even closer. His body was coiled, his hand gripped around the serrated edge of the broken glass, poised to strike. Another step, and the sole of Matt’s shoe scraped gently across the cement floor. He was close, probably on the other side of the stacked chairs. Grant would only get one shot at him before the bullets started flying. He had to make it count.

Silence.

It lingered like before, Grant not breathing, the world still and motionless. And then it happened all at once.

The chairs crashed down over Grant, steel legs and wooden seats cracking against his arms, shoulders, and back. But despite the avalanche of furniture, Grant kept his eyes locked on Matt’s movement as he spun around the chairs, leading with the pistol in his hand."
B079SSPBB51,B079SSPBB5,"Through the dirty front windows of the building, he saw the car had stopped, left parked in the middle of the street.

Matt’s footsteps echoed down the same alley, and Grant gently leaned against the wall, trying to hear what the FBI agent would do. Muttered curses drifted through the back door, and Grant remained quiet and still, hoping he’d managed to give the bastard the slip.

But to Grant’s displeasure, the back door of the building groaned as it was slowly opened, and he quickly ducked behind a stack of chairs and tables as moonlight flooded inside.

One step. Then another. The agent kept close to the exit, waiting for movement, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.

Grant’s vision had already started to make out the objects inside more clearly, and he scanned the floor and found the sharpest shard of glass that he could get his hands on.

Three more steps brought the agent deeper inside, their rhythm more purposeful than when he first entered. But aside from the steps, the agent was silent. He was well trained. Good ol’ Matt the Rat who sold the family out to the people that were after them. The only question left to answer was why. What was in it for him? Money? Power? Revenge?"
B01M5IJM2U0,B01M5IJM2U,"While I have always had a slim frame, my butt and face seem to be the first to pick up any extra weight. And being with David—during the two years we dated and the eleven months since we married—meant I put on a few. David likes to eat. And while he would get up in the early mornings to run it off, I slept in.

Looking at myself now, pulled together and slimmer, I feel a rush of confidence. I look good. I feel good.

Before I make my way out the door, I grab the camel cashmere scarf that my mother gave me for Christmas this past year. And then I put one foot in front of the other, down to the subway, into Manhattan, and uptown.

Evelyn’s place is just off Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park. I’ve done enough Internet stalking to know she’s got this place and a beachfront villa just outside of Málaga, Spain. She’s had this apartment since the late ’60s, when she bought it with Harry Cameron. She inherited the villa when Robert Jamison died almost five years ago. In my next life, please remind me to come back as a movie star with points on the back end."
B01M5IJM2U1,B01M5IJM2U,"The one next to him is staring at her thigh. Both of them seem enraptured and hoping to see the tiniest bit farther.

Maybe I’m overthinking that photo, but I’m starting to notice a pattern: Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.

Even in her much-talked-about sex scene in Three A.M. from 1977, in which she writhes, reverse-cowboy style, on top of Don Adler, you see her full breasts for less than three seconds. It was rumored for years that the incredible box-office numbers for the film were because couples were going to see it multiple times.

How does she know just how much to give and just how much of herself to withhold?

And does that all change now that she’s got something to say? Or is she going to play me the same way she played audiences for years?

Is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?

I WAKE UP A HALF hour before my alarm. I check my e-mails, including one from Frankie with the subject line"
B074ZKDWT20,B074ZKDWT2,"THEY WERE MARRIED THAT JUNE in a ceremony at her family’s church in California, just after Ruby completed her degree, and by July, she was living in Paris. Marcel hadn’t mentioned, at first, that his spacious apartment on the rue Amélie, inherited from his parents, had a view of the tip of the Eiffel Tower, or that it was located in the same building as a tiny art gallery called La Ballerine, whose narrow windows were filled with a changing array of beautiful ballet-themed paintings and sculptures made by local artists. He hadn’t told her about the half-blind and entirely deaf Madame Lefèvre, who served rather inefficiently as the building’s concierge, or about the way one could hear church bells echoing through the streets on Sunday mornings, a concerto of beautiful sounds. But these were the details that brought her new world alive.

Her parents hadn’t wanted her to go, but Ruby had already made up her mind. She loved Marcel, and she would make a life with him. That life would be in Paris, at least for now, and though she would miss her parents terribly, she was eager for an adventure, something to stretch the boundaries of the small world she’d known."
B074ZKDWT21,B074ZKDWT2,"And I won’t find it in the middle of nowhere.

But now, surrounded by mothers holding the hands of cheerful children in thick coats, and with Christmas carols and the smell of roasting chestnuts in the air, she found herself wishing that she wasn’t so alone. As a few snowflakes began to drift from the graying sky, she looked away from the window, sighed, and turned back to Fitzgerald’s The Beautiful and Damned. She could always find comfort in a good book.

She had just taken a sip of her black coffee when the café door opened, letting in both a great gust of wind and a man in a black woolen coat. He removed his hat, revealing a thick shock of dark hair and chiseled features that reminded her a bit of Cary Grant. Ruby’s breath caught in her throat as she stared at him. There was something about him, something mysterious and magnetic, that made it impossible to look away.

The man’s gaze landed on her, and he smiled, a slow, perfect smile. He made his way, limping slightly, to the table directly opposite hers and sat down, removing his overcoat to reveal a perfectly cut navy suit."
B004G60EHS0,B004G60EHS,"The Consul had heard tales of the Wandering Jew and his hopeless quest, but he was shocked to realize that the old man now held the infant in his arms—his daughter Rachel, no more than a few weeks old. The Consul looked away.

The sixth pilgrim and only woman at the table was Brawne Lamia. When introduced, the detective stared at the Consul with such intensity that he could feel the pressure of her gaze even after she looked away.

A former citizen of the 1.3-g world of Lusus, Brawne Lamia was no taller than the poet two chairs to her right, but even her loose corduroy shipsuit did not conceal the heavy layers of muscle on her compact form. Black curls reached to her shoulders, her eyebrows were two dark lines dabbed horizontally across a wide brow, and her nose was solid and sharp, intensifying the aquiline quality of her stare. Lamia’s mouth was wide and expressive to the point of being sensuous, curled slightly at the corners in a slight smile which might be cruel or merely playful. The woman’s dark eyes seemed to dare the observer to discover which was the case.

 It occurred to the Consul that Brawne Lamia might well be considered beautiful.

Introductions completed, the Consul cleared his throat and turned toward the Templar."
B004G60EHS1,B004G60EHS,"Where Kassad was lean and tall, Martin Silenus was short and visibly out of shape. Countering Kassad’s stone-cut features, the poet’s face was as mobile and expressive as an Earth primate’s. His voice was a loud, profane rasp. There was something, thought the Consul, almost pleasantly demonic about Martin Silenus, with his ruddy cheeks, broad mouth, pitched eyebrows, sharp ears, and constantly moving hands sporting fingers long enough to serve a concert pianist. Or a strangler. The poet’s silver hair had been cropped into rough-hewn bangs.

Martin Silenus seemed to be in his late fifties, but the Consul noticed the telltale blue tinge to throat and palms and suspected that the man had been through more than a few Poulsen treatments. Silenus’s true age might be anywhere from ninety to a hundred and fifty standard years. If he were close to the latter age, the Consul knew, the odds were that the poet was quite mad.

As boisterous and animated as Martin Silenus seemed upon first encounter, so the next guest at the table exuded an immediate and equally impressive sense of intelligent reticence. Sol Weintraub looked up upon introduction and the Consul noted the short gray beard, lined forehead, and sad, luminous eyes of the well-known scholar."
B00BATG18K0,B00BATG18K,"The guests raised their cups, tipped their heads back, and downed the wine in one swallow. Next came a Western settee upholstered in pink sateen—two toasts for that! More gifts came. Finally Prosper handed Billowy Cloud what she wanted most, an envelope of money, the first of her monthly stipend. She saw the amount, gasped, and fell speechless as tears streamed down her face. We would not know until later if her tears were because she received more than she had expected or less. Another toast was raised. Billowy Cloud insisted she could not drink another. Her face wore splotches of red and she said she felt the ceiling lurching one way and the floor the other. But Prosper grabbed her chin and forced down the wine, followed immediately by another as his friends egged him on. All at once, Billowy Cloud gurgled and vomited before she collapsed to the floor. Golden Dove quickly signaled the musician for a final song to hurry the guests out of the room, and Prosper left with them, without a glance toward Billowy Cloud, who lay on the floor, babbling apology. Magic Cloud tried to sit her up, but the senseless girl flopped backward like a dead fish."
B00BATG18K1,B00BATG18K,"I learned that Billowy Cloud was sixteen and he was fifty or so. Golden Dove consoled her, saying he would be quite generous, as old men tended to be. And Billowy Cloud said that Prosper Yang loved her and she felt lucky.

My mother was renowned for holding the best weddings of all the courtesan houses. They were Western in style, as opposed to the traditional Chinese weddings for virgin brides, a category to which courtesans could never belong. The courtesan brides even wore a Western white wedding gown, and my mother had a variety the Cloud Beauties could use. The style was clearly Yankee—with low bodices and voluminous skirts, wrapped in glossy gathered silk, and trimmed in lace, embroidery, and seed pearls. Those dresses never would have been confused with the Chinese mourning clothes of rough white sackcloth.

A Western wedding had its advantages, as I had already learned from having attended a Chinese version for a courtesan at another house. For one thing, it did not involve honoring ancestors, who certainly would have disavowed a courtesan as his descendant. So there were no boring rituals or kneeling and endless bowing. The ceremony was short. The prayers were omitted."
B007UH4D3G0,B007UH4D3G,"Mike Bowman sat beside the bed, close to his daughter. Mike thought Dr. Cruz was probably pretty capable; he spoke excellent English, the result of training at medical centers in London and Baltimore. Dr. Cruz radiated competence, and the Clínica Santa María, the modern hospital in Puntarenas, was spotless and efficient.

But, even so, Mike Bowman felt nervous. There was no getting around the fact that his only daughter was desperately ill, and they were far from home.

When Mike had first reached Tina, she was screaming hysterically. Her whole left arm was bloody, covered with a profusion of small bites, each the size of a thumbprint. And there were flecks of sticky foam on her arm, like a foamy saliva.

He carried her back down the beach. Almost immediately her arm began to redden and swell. Mike would not soon forget the frantic drive back to civilization, the four-wheel-drive Land Rover slipping and sliding up the muddy track into the hills, while his daughter screamed in fear and pain, and her arm grew more bloated and red. Long before they reached the park boundaries, the swelling had spread to her neck, and then Tina began to have trouble breathing. …"
B007UH4D3G1,B007UH4D3G,"Standing like that, it was almost a foot tall, dark green with brown stripes along its back. Its tiny front legs ended in little lizard fingers that wiggled in the air. The lizard cocked its head as it looked at her.

Tina thought it was cute. Sort of like a big salamander. She raised her hand and wiggled her fingers back.

The lizard wasn’t frightened. It came toward her, walking upright on its hind legs. It was hardly bigger than a chicken, and like a chicken it bobbed its head as it walked. Tina thought it would make a wonderful pet.

She noticed that the lizard left three-toed tracks that looked exactly like bird tracks. The lizard came closer to Tina. She kept her body still, not wanting to frighten the little animal. She was amazed that it would come so close, but she remembered that this was a national park. All the animals in the park would know that they were protected. This lizard was probably tame. Maybe it even expected her to give it some food. Unfortunately she didn’t have any. Slowly, Tina extended her hand, palm open, to show she didn’t have any food.

The lizard paused, cocked his head, and chirped."

Dearest Layla,

I must say, it’s very inconsiderate of you to run off to cry on Lance’s shoulder and leave me here to cope with Papa in the state he’s in, and I certainly hope you’re not having a rendezvous with that awful Charles Antonin, because Papa will find out, and he’ll be even more furious than he is right now. Nothing I say moves him even the tiniest bit, and I can’t help it but you simply have to take Ben’s tatty old job. I know what you think—and imagine my feelings at the thought of you among grubby coal miners— but I’m afraid Papa won’t budge, darling. He says if you won’t marry Nelson—I’m not lecturing, I’m only repeating what Papa says—then you have to face stark reality. I wept and said I was sure you’d get ringworm, but that just made Papa fuss the more. He said it was time you understood what you were throwing away and if it took worms to make you understand it, that was fine by him (I didn’t tell Papa, but I don’t believe there are real worms in ringworm).

I never thought my own daughter would be on relief. I could just strangle Ben.

Your loving,

Mother

Layla ,

Do you realize that nearly one-quarter of the employable citizens of this country are out of work? Do you realize that I receive dozens of letters each week from diligent, well-educated men and women imploring me for a job, any job, on the project? These people are desperate, Layla. They’ve been unemployed for so long they’ve forgotten what it’s like to work, they’ve sold everything they had for pennies, they go to bed hungry —inside if they’re lucky, outside if they’re not—and they wake up hungry. They’ve been wearing the same suit of clothes for years, sponged off each night because if they scrub it on a washboard, the cloth will shred to rags. Their children are sick because they don’t get enough to eat, and they’re dirty because there’s no place to wash. These are people who never thought they’d have to beg, and yet here they are, begging me for a job that won’t pay them enough to keep food in their stomachs.

There’s an opening on the West Virginia Writers’ Project. I have, against my better judgment, given you that position. Be grateful or be damned.

B072DZRY4K0,B072DZRY4K,"I had no heat to cook with, but we had bread and I knew we had cheese and some apples. I was so light and happy to be just us four.

Then I heard the crunch of tyres on gravel and saw, entering our establishment, a 1938 Plymouth equipped with one of those wood-burning gas producers, from the days of wartime petrol rationing. This one had a large cylindrical furnace. From this a pipe snaked across the roof and then down into the engine. Who would drive a thing like this in 1953?

As the window in the driver’s door descended slowly, the vehicle cut rudely in front of me, laying white oil smoke across the yard.

My father-in-law was on the graveyard side of seventy, but he stepped into our yard clad in the usual cotton dustcoat, full of piss and vinegar. How had he tracked us down? He released a statuesque biddy in furs and high heeled shoes. That must be the Mrs. Donaldson. Ignorant, I thought, seeing how she gave the kiddies barley sugar.

No-one had invited Mr. Bachhuber but there he was standing on the Plymouth’s running board, inspecting the dog’s breakfast on the roof, amongst which, it seems, he had identified an old aircraft propeller."
B072DZRY4K1,B072DZRY4K,"He meant the colander and I followed him inside trying to remember where I had packed the Kraft cheddar. It was a Sunday. All the shops were closed.

The house was a shambles and a pigsty and the movers had left the hydraulic jack in the hall and the kitchen table in the living room. There was a hole kicked in the bedroom plaster I hadn’t noticed when I took the place. Only now did I learn that the oven was coated with rancid grease. I turned on the gas range but it would not light. I tried a dozen matches and burned my finger on the last one before I accepted that the gas was not connected.

Meanwhile the neighbour had vanished. Embarrassed for me, probably, but we would get our domestic situation into shape. The hydraulic jack was six feet long, weighed a ton, but I wheeled it out to the back door and across the threshold and down the garden path. Finally the gravel stopped all further movement.

 Ronnie had commandeered next door’s colander and was gathering eggs from amongst the canna lilies. The neighbour was standing at the fence again. He raised his eyebrows, perhaps referring to the tea towel on his shoulder. He was a comic turn, but not too much I hoped."

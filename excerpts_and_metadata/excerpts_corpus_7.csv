B004J4WKUQ0,B004J4WKUQ,"I slipped out the window as quietly as possible and, clutching the bottom of the window frame, slid down the cold surface of the trailer’s metal siding. The steel platform on which the trailer rested was only slightly wider and longer than the trailer itself, leaving a ledge about a foot and a half wide all the way around. I carefully lowered myself until my feet rested on this ledge, then reached up to close the window behind me. I grabbed hold of a rope I’d strung there at waist level to serve as a handhold and began to sidestep along the ledge to the corner of the platform. From there I was able to descend the ladderlike frame of the scaffolding. I almost always took this route when leaving or returning to my aunt’s trailer. A rickety metal staircase was bolted to the side of the stack, but it shook and knocked against the scaffolding, so I couldn’t use it without announcing my presence. Bad news. In the stacks, it was best to avoid being heard or seen, whenever possible. There were often dangerous and desperate people about—the sort who would rob you, rape you, and then sell your organs on the black market."
B004J4WKUQ1,B004J4WKUQ,"Every stack in our park stood at least fifteen mobile homes high (with the occasional RV, shipping container, Airstream trailer, or VW microbus mixed in for variety). In recent years, many of the stacks had grown to a height of twenty units or more. This made a lot of people nervous. Stack collapses weren’t that uncommon, and if the scaffold supports buckled at the wrong angle, the domino effect could bring down four or five of the neighboring stacks too.

Our trailer was near the northern edge of the stacks, which ran up to a crumbling highway overpass. From my vantage point at the laundry room window, I could see a thin stream of electric vehicles crawling along the cracked asphalt, carrying goods and workers into the city. As I stared out at the grim skyline, a bright sliver of the sun peeked over the horizon. Watching it rise, I performed a mental ritual: Whenever I saw the sun, I reminded myself that I was looking at a star. One of over a hundred billion stars in our galaxy. A galaxy that was just one of billions of other galaxies in the observable universe. This helped me keep things in perspective. I’d started doing it after watching a science program from the early ’80s called Cosmos."
B004J4WKUQ2,B004J4WKUQ,"Rick was perpetually shirtless, because he liked to show off his impressive collection of prison tattoos. Without saying a word, he walked over and raised a fist at me threateningly. I flinched and handed over the laptop. Then he and Aunt Alice walked out, already discussing how much the computer might fetch at a pawnshop.

Losing the laptop wasn’t a big deal. I had two spares stowed in my hideout. But they weren’t nearly as fast, and I would have to reload all of my media onto them from backup drives. A total pain in the ass. But it was my own fault. I knew the risk of bringing anything of value back here.

The dark blue light of dawn was starting to creep in through the laundry room window. I decided it might be a good idea to leave for school a little early today.

I dressed as quickly and quietly as possible, pulling on the worn corduroys, baggy sweater, and oversize coat that comprised my entire winter wardrobe. Then I put on my backpack and climbed up onto the washing machine. After pulling on my gloves, I slid open the frost-covered window. The arctic morning air stung my cheeks as I gazed out over the uneven sea of trailer rooftops."
B004J4WKUQ3,B004J4WKUQ,"At least that’s what I kept telling myself, in a vain attempt to stave off the epic loneliness I now felt.

Then the Hunt for Halliday’s Easter egg began. That was what saved me, I think. Suddenly I’d found something worth doing. A dream worth chasing. For the last five years, the Hunt had given me a goal and purpose. A quest to fulfill. A reason to get up in the morning. Something to look forward to.

The moment I began searching for the egg, the future no longer seemed so bleak.

I was halfway through the fourth episode of my Family Ties mini-marathon when the laundry room door creaked open and my aunt Alice walked in, a malnourished harpy in a housecoat, clutching a basket of dirty clothes. She looked more lucid than usual, which was bad news. She was much easier to deal with when she was high.

She glanced over at me with the usual look of disdain and started to load her clothes into the washer. Then her expression changed and she peeked around the dryer to get a better look at me. Her eyes went wide when she spotted my laptop. I quickly closed it and began to shove it into my backpack, but I knew it was already too late."
B071WKLCXH0,B071WKLCXH,"I was especially excited to read that he thought he’d know more in a couple of days. That meant that whatever tip they were working, the job was already under way.

If the CIA could set me free soon, I would be the happiest person in the world.

With a ton of decisions to make very quickly.

A knock on my door brought me out of my thoughts, and I logged off and closed my laptop, figuring it was Carter. He knew my real identity and had met my partner, Harrison, but I didn’t feel like sharing this with him just yet. I didn’t want him getting his hopes up. Mine were already up enough for both of us.

I hurried to the front door and was surprised to see Ida Belle and Gertie standing there. Ida Belle looked worried. Gertie looked confused. Neither gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling. I waved them in and closed and locked the door behind them. I’d gotten lax the last couple of weeks with locks during the day and was trying to correct that bad habit. It might be all right for other residents of Sinful to take such a risk, but it was a foolish one for me to indulge in."
B071WKLCXH1,B071WKLCXH,"I was a bit surprised that Harrison had responded so quickly, but popped upright in my chair and clicked on the message.

To: farmgirl433

From: hotdudeinNE

I tried to tell you to be nice to nosy old ladies. If you’re nice, they bring baked goods and try to set you up with their grandsons, but if you’re remotely off-putting, they see it as a challenge. The weather cooled a bit here for a while, but it’s right back up into the stratosphere. I would love to have you for a visit, but I wouldn’t have time to even share a cup of coffee at the moment. I’m bringing on some additional help the next couple days. Let me see how that works and I’ll let you know if it frees me up any.

Looking forward to seeing you again. Avoid the neighbor. She sounds exhausting.

My pulse ticked up a notch as I read the email. The weather cooling meant the CIA had no luck locating Ahmad, but if things were heating up into the stratosphere now, then they had a hot tip. So hot they were bringing in more agents to work it —hence Harrison’s comment about additional help."
B071WKLCXH2,B071WKLCXH,"He’d had a relationship with a Special Forces woman in the past that had ended tragically, and he’d sworn he’d never get involved with a woman who took those sorts of risks again. I knew that PIs normally didn’t have the kind of risk associated with their work that Special Forces or federal agents did, but Sinful had proved to be a hotbed of criminal activity with a lot of violence associated.

I took a drink of soda and slumped back in my seat. None of it mattered if Celia managed to find what she was looking for. If she blew my cover, I’d be whisked away to a new location and unable to talk to anyone in Sinful until Ahmad was in custody or dead. That could be weeks or months or God forbid, even years. It was a bleak thought. Anything could happen over a long period of time. Ida Belle and Gertie weren’t getting any younger. They could get ill or even worse. Carter could decide he’d made a mistake getting involved with me and start dating a nice, pretty girl who’d never been shot at and hadn’t been paid to kill people for a living.

Basically, I could be forgotten. Replaced.

I blew out a breath and my computer beeped, signaling an incoming email."
B071WKLCXH3,B071WKLCXH,"I figured Harrison and Morrow already had a couple of things in mind, and I was more than certain that I wouldn’t like any of them.

I had hated the idea of coming to Sinful. Had protested with all of my being and had been so dead set against it that I was ready to risk an assassination just to avoid it. But I’d been wrong. Coming to Sinful and becoming friends with Ida Belle and Gertie was one of the best things that had ever happened to me. The other was Carter. Meeting them and seeing how life could be had made me question everything about my past choices to the point that I’d finally decided I’d gotten most everything wrong.

I’d already decided to leave the CIA when this nightmare was over, but what I still wasn’t completely sure about was what I would do afterward. Ida Belle and Gertie had been pushing me toward getting my private investigator license, and I’ll admit, it was an intriguing idea, but I knew it would put a strain on my relationship with Carter. He was still coming to terms with who I really was and all the lies I’d told to keep it a secret."
B007978OY60,B007978OY6,"It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully.

It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo’s health and doings.

Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar tap on the study window.

Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard at one another."
B007978OY61,B007978OY6,"That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these, but they had no name.

Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.

Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him was Ted Sandyman, the miller’s son; and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk."
B007978OY62,B007978OY6,"He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire.

There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers. The ancient East–West Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits’ chief source of news from distant parts – if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor."
B007978OY63,B007978OY6,"He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time.

Chapter 2

THE SHADOW OF THE PAST

The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten.

But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf."
B00BVFM04C0,B00BVFM04C,"Unlike the traditional designs of submarines, a sphere or globe maintained perfect pressure on all sides as it descended, in essence making the craft stronger the deeper it went. By designing the Triton around such a shape, it was able to reach deeper depths without special efforts to increase body strength required in older tube shapes. The tradeoff, of course, was speed. With more surface area meeting the water while it moved, Clay guessed that the Triton was likely twenty-five percent slower than older models. Nevertheless, with the benefit of a deeper limit without a ship having to carry thousands of feet of thick cable to use as an umbilical cord, he could see why the Triton II was so popular.

Edwin Tay was of Chinese descent and looked to be in his late thirties. He was shorter than the rest of the team but was clearly in charge. He was giving a steady stream of instructions as they smoothly moved the rover out and over the water, suspended by a long, thick articulating arm. He finally turned and motioned for one of his team to lock it in place just moments before the drone of the engines disappeared and the ship began slowing to a stop. Emerson caught his attention and waved him over."
B00BVFM04C1,B00BVFM04C,"Clay often joked that had he been there; Caesare would have slept through the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

Clay watched through the window as the helicopter dropped closer to sea level. After a few minutes, the pilot leveled off and skimmed the last mile at just under a hundred feet, low enough to see schools of colorful fish below the clear blue water. He slapped Caesare awake and fastened his seat belt.

The helicopter slowed and hovered as it positioned itself over the ship’s black landing pad. It floated close to the deck until the pilot could match the rising and falling of the ship on the ocean swells. Reaching the last few feet, the craft dropped suddenly and bounced onto the pad. An ensign trotted out beneath the slowing blades and pulled the door open. With a quick salute, he unfolded the small set of stairs outward and motioned for Clay and Caesare to follow him.

They grabbed their bags and made their way off the pad and across the deck. After climbing two flights of stairs, they opened a white steel door and stepped onto the bridge.

Captain Emerson looked up as the two men stepped inside.

Emerson grinned and extended his hand to Clay."
B00BVFM04C2,B00BVFM04C,"The Department of Naval Investigations was a large department and took a large part of the Pentagon’s second floor, rings A through E, on the west side. Consisting of several hundred staff, most specializing in legal and personnel issues, the department was growing as a result of the softening of military policies. Personnel issues such as harassment had skyrocketed over the last several years as the military struggled to adapt to twenty-first century expectations. Next to legal and HR, the Navy’s technology group was small by comparison. Clay’s team was smaller still. Electronics and Signaling was a specialty that very few understood, let alone were interested in. Even the brass, who were often technology ’s strongest advocates , did not really want to know how. They just wanted it to work. Clay’s E&S team often had to find out why a technology was not working, where the failure occurred and why. It required expert level knowledge in a wide variety of technologies including computer chip design, networking, signaling and a thorough understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Clay turned a corner and passed a number of offices. His aide, Jennifer, was clearly expecting him when he opened the door and walked through."
B00BVFM04C3,B00BVFM04C,"They burst into the research area to find Lee Kenwood in his usual spot, at a large desk crammed with monitors and keyboards with cables snaking all over the floor, something Alison always imagined the bowels of a phone company to look like. Behind Lee and against the wall were several tall metal racks holding dozens of computer servers each. In the middle section of one of the center racks stood a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, used for manually controlling any of the one-inch thick machines, even though it was something Lee rarely had to do anymore. With the myriad of systems on his own desk, he could now just as easily connect to the servers remotely.

The wall opposite the servers was part of the dolphin’s tank, constructed in clear glass to allow optimal visibility for study. Before the thick glass stood six mechanical apparatuses of varying height and complexity, with a digital video camera perched on top of each. Around the room were several dozen books and journals on topics ranging from marine biology, to language analysis, to writing code in various computer languages.

Alison made it to Lee’s desk before her wet bag even hit the carpeted floor."
B007978PGI0,B007978PGI,"From the cataclysm there are survivors: Elendil the Fair, chief of the Faithful (his name means Elf-friend), and his sons Isildur and Anarion. Elendil, a Noachian figure, who has held off from the rebellion, and kept ships manned and furnished off the east coast of Númenor, flees before the overwhelming storm of the wrath of the West, and is borne high upon the towering waves that bring ruin to the west of the Middle-earth. He and his folk are cast away as exiles upon the shores. There they establish the Númenórean kingdoms of Arnor in the north close to the realm of Gilgalad, and Gondor about the mouths of Anduin further south. Sauron, being an immortal, hardly escapes the ruin of Númenor and returns to Mordor, where after a while he is strong enough to challenge the exiles of Númenor.

The Second Age ends with the Last Alliance (of Elves and Men), and the great siege of Mordor. It ends with the overthrow of Sauron and destruction of the second visible incarnation of evil. But at a cost, and with one disastrous mistake. Gilgalad and Elendil are slain in the act of slaying Sauron. Isildur, Elendil’s son, cuts the ring from Sauron’s hand, and his power departs, and his spirit flees into the shadows. But the evil begins to work."
B007978PGI1,B007978PGI,"But there he swiftly rises by his cunning and knowledge from servant to chief counsellor of the king, and seduces the king and most of the lords and people with his lies. He denies the existence of God, saying that the One is a mere invention of the jealous Valar of the West, the oracle of their own wishes. The chief of the gods is he that dwells in the Void, who will conquer in the end, and in the void make endless realms for his servants. The Ban is only a lying device of fear to restrain the Kings of Men from seizing everlasting life and rivalling the Valar.

A new religion, and worship of the Dark, with its temple under Sauron arises. The Faithful are persecuted and sacrificed. The Númenóreans carry their evil also to Middle-earth and there become cruel and wicked lords of necromancy, slaying and tormenting men; and the old legends are overlaid with dark tales of horror. This does not happen, however, in the North West; for thither, because of the Elves, only the Faithful who remain Elf-friends will come. The chief haven of the good Númenóreans is near the mouth of the great river Anduin. Thence the still beneficent influence of Númenor spreads up the River and along the coasts as far north as the realm of Gilgalad, as a Common Speech grows up."
B007978PGI2,B007978PGI,"This was the essential weakness he had introduced into his situation in his effort (largely unsuccessful) to enslave the Elves, and in his desire to establish a control over the minds and wills of his servants. There was another weakness: if the One Ring was actually unmade, annihilated, then its power would be dissolved, Sauron’s own being would be diminished to vanishing point, and he would be reduced to a shadow, a mere memory of malicious will. But that he never contemplated nor feared. The Ring was unbreakable by any smithcraft less than his own. It was indissoluble in any fire, save the undying subterranean fire where it was made – and that was unapproachable, in Mordor. Also so great was the Ring’s power of lust, that anyone who used it became mastered by it; it was beyond the strength of any will (even his own) to injure it, cast it away, or neglect it. So he thought. It was in any case on his finger.

Thus, as the Second Age draws on, we have a great Kingdom and evil theocracy (for Sauron is also the god of his slaves) growing up in Middle-earth. In the West – actually the North-West is the only part clearly envisaged in these tales – lie the precarious refuges of the Elves, while Men in those parts remain more or less uncorrupted if ignorant."
B007978PGI3,B007978PGI,"so he is called as he casts a fleeting shadow and presage on the pages of The Hobbit): such as rendering invisible the material body, and making things of the invisible world visible.

The Elves of Eregion made Three supremely beautiful and powerful rings, almost solely of their own imagination, and directed to the preservation of beauty: they did not confer invisibility. But secretly in the subterranean Fire, in his own Black Land, Sauron made One Ring, the Ruling Ring that contained the powers of all the others, and controlled them, so that its wearer could see the thoughts of all those that used the lesser rings, could govern all that they did, and in the end could utterly enslave them. He reckoned, however, without the wisdom and subtle perceptions of the Elves. The moment he assumed the One, they were aware of it, and of his secret purpose, and were afraid. They hid the Three Rings, so that not even Sauron ever discovered where they were and they remained unsullied. The others they tried to destroy.

In the resulting war between Sauron and the Elves Middle-earth, especially in the west, was further ruined. Eregion was captured and destroyed, and Sauron seized many Rings of Power. These he gave, for their ultimate corruption and enslavement, to those who would accept them (out of ambition or greed)."
B06Y5WRS2C0,B06Y5WRS2C,"They roasted hot dogs for dinner and made s’mores for dessert and shared dreams about what they would discover at the end of the road. Leni had never seen her parents so happy. Her dad most of all. He laughed, he smiled, he told jokes and promised them the moon. He was the dad she remembered from Before.

Usually, on road trips, Leni kept her nose buried in a book, but on this trip the scenery had often demanded her attention, especially through the gorgeous mountains of British Columbia. In the ever-changing landscape, she sat in the backseat of the bus, imagining herself as Frodo or Bilbo, the hero of her own quest.

The VW bus thumped over something—a curb, maybe—and stuff went flying inside, dropped to the floor, rolled into the backpacks and boxes that filled the back of the bus. They screeched to a halt that smelled of burnt rubber and exhaust.

Sunlight streamed through the dirty, mosquito-splattered windows. Leni climbed over the heap of their poorly rolled sleeping bags and opened the side door. Their rainbow-decorated ALASKA OR BUST sign fluttered in the cool breeze, the sides anchored in place by duct tape.

Leni stepped out of the bus."
B06Y5WRS2C1,B06Y5WRS2C,"To hear the words now unsettled them.

He tapped his foot on the floor, played a beat on the table with fast-moving fingers. He unfolded the letter, smoothed it out, and turned it so they could read the words.

Sergeant Allbright—

You are a hard man to find. I am Earl Harlan.

My son, Bo, wrote many letters home about his friendship with you. I thank you for that.

In his last letter, he told me that if anything happened to him in that piece of shit place, he wanted you to have his land up here in Alaska.

It isn’t much. Forty acres with a cabin that needs fixing. But a hardworking man can live off the land up here, away from the crazies and the hippies and the mess in the Lower Forty-eight.

I don’t have no phone, but you can write me c/o the Homer Post Office. I’ll get the letter sooner or later.

The land is at the end of the road, past the silver gate with a cow skull and just before the burnt tree, at mile marker 13.

Thanks again,

Earl

Mama looked up. She cocked her head, gave a little birdlike tilt as she studied Dad."
B06Y5WRS2C2,B06Y5WRS2C,"Her house sat in the middle of a cul-de-sac, on a yard less tended than the rest: a bark-brown rambler with empty flower boxes and clogged gutters and a garage door that didn’t close. Weeds grew in clumps from the decaying gray roof shingles. An empty flagpole pointed accusingly upward, a statement about her father’s hatred of where this country was headed. For a man whom Mama called a patriot, he sure hated his government.

She saw Dad in the garage, sitting on a slanted workbench beside Mama’s dented-up Mustang with the duct-taped top. Cardboard boxes lined the interior walls, full of stuff they hadn’t yet unpacked from the last move.

He was dressed—as usual—in his frayed military jacket and torn Levi’s. He sat slouched forward, his elbows resting on his thighs. His long black hair was a tangled mess and his mustache needed trimming. His dirty feet were bare. Even slumped over and tired-looking, he was movie-star handsome. Everyone thought so.

He cocked his head, peered at her through his hair. The smile he gave her was a little worn around the edges, but it still lit up his face. That was the thing about her dad: he might be moody and sharp-tempered, even a little scary sometimes, but that was just because he felt things like love and loss and disappointment so keenly. Love most of all."
B06Y5WRS2C3,B06Y5WRS2C,"As far as Leni could tell, adults were edgy in general, and no wonder. The war in Vietnam had divided the country. Newspapers blared bad news daily: bombings by Weatherman or the IRA; planes being hijacked; the kidnapping of Patty Hearst. The massacre at the Munich Olympics had stunned the whole world, as had the Watergate scandal. And recently, college girls in Washington State had begun to disappear without a trace. It was a dangerous world.

She would give anything for a real friend right now. It was all she really wanted: someone to talk to.

On the other hand, it didn’t help to talk about her worries. What was the point of confession?

Sure, Dad lost his temper sometimes and he yelled and they never had enough money and they moved all the time to distance themselves from creditors, but that was their way, and they loved each other.

But sometimes, especially on days like today, Leni was afraid. It felt to her as if her family stood poised on the edge of a great precipice that could collapse at any second, crumble away like the houses that crashed down Seattle’s unstable, waterlogged hillsides.

* * *

AFTER SCHOOL, Leni walked home in the rain, alone."
B071LQVXHW0,B071LQVXHW,"One day all the electronic devices would explode at once and set the world on fire. She laughed out loud at the vision of throngs of tourists walking the downtown streets of Charleston with flaming cell phones pressed to their ears. She’d been having the strangest thoughts lately.

One Christmas several years ago, her family gave her a computer, one of the portable kind that you opened up in your lap. She’d taken it back to the Apple Store and gotten an iPad instead. The handheld gadget served its purpose. She was able to get the e-mails she couldn’t avoid—correspondence relating to family business and confirmation notices of her online purchases. Lula loved to shop for china and crystal on eBay. She now had enough of her wedding and holiday patterns to feed twenty-four. One day her daughters would bring home their spouses and offspring for the holidays. She aimed to be prepared for Thanksgiving and Easter and every occasion in between.

Lula took the phone back to the kitchen and collapsed in a chair at the table. She clicked on the missed call. She had to admit that being instantly connected to her loved ones without having to punch the numbers into her wall phone was convenient.

Brooke answered on the first ring."
B071LQVXHW1,B071LQVXHW,"Walking Pooh to the stop sign at the end of the street and back three times a day offered ample exertion. Anything extra might cause her ticker to tock.

Lula heard her cell phone ringing in a distant part of the house. She froze, listening. She didn’t want to miss the repairman calling to say he was on the way. She’d told the dispatch woman to have him ring her on the house line, but the woman had been too bored to pay attention. She followed the ringing sound through the back hallway to the new part of the house. Despite the cozy feel of the room— the leather-upholstered furniture, thick wool carpet, and stone fireplace— they referred to this space as the Florida room. The large windows allowed sunlight to beam in and provided a lovely view of her perennial garden, now in full bloom, in the tiny backyard.

Her oldest daughter had already hung up by the time Lula located the phone wedged between the sofa cushions. Brooke knew better than to call her on her cell phone. Lula despised modern technology. She preferred paperback copies over e-books. She wanted her mail delivered by the mailman. And she would rather read a road map than listen to an automated voice on a GPS instructing her where to go."
B071LQVXHW2,B071LQVXHW,"She wadded it up, tossed it into the trash can, and tore off two more sheets. She lifted her cotton blouse and stuffed the paper towels in the damp spots under both breasts. Eek! She really needed to do something about her soft, doughy midsection that was getting softer and doughier by the day in spite of her active life. She served meals at homeless shelters and tutored at after-school programs for underprivileged children. She tended her perennial garden, cleaned her house from top to bottom once a week, and spent hours on her feet in the kitchen cooking for her family and the sick folks who belonged to her church.

So many of her friends had gone gaga over physical fitness. Midge, her next-door neighbor to her left, pounded the pavement every morning, running no fewer than three miles, and Georgia, her neighbor on the other side, attended yoga classes several times a week. The gals in her bridge and book clubs talked incessantly about the exercise classes they attended—spinning and core barre, hot yoga, Pilates, and total-body conditioning. Wasn’t boot camp for the marines? Sixty is the new fifty, blah blah blah. In Lula’s case, fifty-five was the new sixty-five, and she was darn proud of it."
B071LQVXHW3,B071LQVXHW,"The sultry summer air permeated the house through open windows, but the ceiling fans spinning at full blast did little to cool down the rooms. The walls sweated. The doors swelled. Every surface was covered in a sticky film. The heat index in the kitchen was higher by ten degrees than the rest of the house thanks to the pot of butter beans simmering on the stove and the oven preheating to roast.

The thought of eating a heavy meal in this heat made the meager contents of Lula’s stomach sour. Her ideal supper on a blazing hot day consisted of a spoonful of chicken salad and a cup of gazpacho made fresh from the summer’s ripe tomatoes, topped off with a scoop of caramel praline crunch ice cream for dessert. Such meager fixings would not do for her husband. Phillip had grown to expect a three-course meal every night of the week. And she’d done everything in her power as a housewife to foster that growth. She prided herself on her skills as a homemaker—her culinary talents, green thumb, and special knack for making their abode cozy and inviting.

Lula seasoned her eye-of-round roast with salt and pepper and slid the pan into the oven, lowering the temperature to 475 degrees."
B07196BC8V0,B07196BC8V,"Johann positioned the lower part in a vise, angled his small chisel, took a hammer in hand, and began tapping out a heart-shaped motif.

The young father lost all notion of time and space as the sky gradually grew light over Altona. Since making his decision to volunteer, he’d hardly slept. Last night, too, he had crept on tiptoe from the bedroom to the workshop with a pot of strong tea. He couldn’t stop thinking of yesterday’s encounter with the young beggar. Martin’s family of six lived in two drafty rooms. His father worked as a day laborer, and his mother still hadn’t fully recovered from giving birth to her latest baby. They had been shaken to the core when Johann told them what had happened. They had no idea their son begged on the street instead of going to school, although they had wondered about the money Martin sometimes claimed to have found.

Johann fell to brooding. A while later, he looked at his watch, quickly covered his work with a soft cloth, climbed the stairs to the storeroom, and filled a basket with flour, salted herring, eggs, and summer vegetables.

He ran into Lotte on the way out. Although she did not show it, he could feel her despair and her anger."
B07196BC8V1,B07196BC8V,"As the cart clattered away, Johann’s eye was caught by a boy of about ten, who was playing harmonica on the other side of the street, a threadbare cap lying at his feet. His shoes were far too big, probably borrowed. Johann had often seen him begging. He had chosen his time of day well, as all of Altona seemed to be afoot, and a few people paused to throw the child a coin.

The little beggar always triggered an uneasy feeling in Johann. Did his parents know what he was doing out on the streets? The boy seemed to sense he was being watched, and looked up. When Johann nodded to him, he quickly tucked the harmonica away in his pocket.

A gang of adolescents appeared, crowding around him and laughing raucously. They shoved the child down onto the wet pavement. Horrified, Johann moved closer to the window. One of the attackers took the opportunity to give the boy a kick in the stomach. As he doubled up with pain, another grabbed him by the hair. Johann seized his walking stick and hurried out. As soon as the gang saw him, his stick raised menacingly, they made to leave, but Johann managed to plant himself in their way. A few passersby watched curiously."
B07196BC8V2,B07196BC8V,"It was to be a gift for his four-year-old son, Paul. His farewell gift.

Johann dashed tears from the corners of his eyes. From the upper floor, where his family lived, he heard his son’s pattering footsteps. Over them came the voice of his wife, Lotte, probably warning her little rascal not to disturb his father’s work. If only Johann knew how to tell them about his decision.

He waited until Paul was asleep, then went up to the living room and sat down next to his wife on the Biedermeier sofa—a wedding present from his older brother, Max.

Lotte smiled absently before lowering her head back to her embroidery. A few curly locks had come loose from her braid, falling over her pretty, gentle face. Once again, Johann thought how fortunate he was that he could call the most warmhearted, intelligent woman in the whole town his own. He had loved her for as long as he could remember, since they’d first met in the synagogue at the tender age of ten. Even then, he had declared to his father with utter conviction that, one day, she would be his wife. He had achieved his heart’s desire five years ago."
B07196BC8V3,B07196BC8V,"This fine silver was no different from any that Johann Blumenthal had held in his skilled hands before, but as the young silversmith bent low over the bench and narrowed his eyes to inspect it beneath his magnifying glass, an idea of what it would become was already forming in his mind. A melancholy smile came to his lips as his sensitive fingers gently brushed the surface. How could Johann imagine the ways this piece would affect his family, that its value would far exceed all the jewelry and ornaments he had ever crafted?

Johann was a striking man, not so much because of his fine features or his above-average height, but because his light-blue eyes were like windows to his thoughts. Maybe it was also the way he tilted his head when listening, giving everyone he spoke to the impression of his undivided attention.

His back prematurely bent by work, thirty-year-old Johann was sitting in the workshop of Blumenthal & Sons. He loved the evenings, when the day’s work was done and he was free to experiment, innovate, and create fine works of art. As he studied the silver on his bench, the final piece took shape in his mind’s eye. His hands flew to a sketchbook, and a deep crease formed between his brows as he drew the two parts of a little box. This would be something special, unique—not destined for the display window of Blumenthal & Sons."
B07BQCP82B0,B07BQCP82B,"But there’s no way to go about it discreetly when you’re the President of the United States. The media scrutiny would scare anyone in their right mind off, and besides, a lot of women don’t want to date politicians. Not the good ones at least. So Gold Medallion meets my needs in a very specific way, and my employees are always sifting through submissions. A team reviews any potential women before presenting me with a select number of candidates, and then I go from there.

And Bridget stood out. I’m used to seeing beautiful women smiling at me from their headshots, not to mention women who have resumes worthy of a Nobel scientist. There are ladies who have graduate degrees up the wazoo, who can speak five languages and also communicate via sign language with monkeys. But I’m not into that because deep down, I’m still Robbie Carter from Arkansas, and a woman who has too much going on isn’t my type. I don’t want someone who’s done everything right in life. God knows I’ve made a lot of mistakes to get where I am. So instead, someone real and sassy, with curves and a good sense of humor is what I’m looking for."
B07BQCP82B1,B07BQCP82B,"They photoshopped some penguins in, and also the Taj Mahal and the Kremlin. They should have included a pic of the White House. That would have been more accurate at least.

But Robert’s my avatar, and not a bad one. He’s a guy who looks kinda like me what with the dark hair and blue eyes, but he’s a model and nothing else. He’s a stand-in for the real thing, which is Robert Carter from Little Rock, Arkansas. I’ve been a politician since I was old enough to run for president of my high school class, and once bitten by the bug, I couldn’t stop. So I went from state representative to U.S. Senator, Governor, and now finally President.

It’s not bad, to be honest. After all, being Commander-in-Chief has been my desire since I was about ten years old. But the path hasn’t been easy and it hasn’t left a lot of time for dating. Anyone who knows me knows that I’m traveling non-stop, the interior of Air Force One my real home.

So yeah, Gold Medallion was set up to service my needs. After all, I function best when I have release, just like any other alpha male."
B07BQCP82B2,B07BQCP82B,"But it’s just part of the process. And I know what you’re thinking. Is it possible that the President of the United States, Robert Carter, is moonlighting as a male escort? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t a simple yes or no. Because yes, we work with Gold Medallion to get me dates. Or more precisely, Gold Medallion works for us. Because my guys actually own Gold Medallion. They incorporated a company somewhere in the Bahamas behind three different shell companies. And then they hired a bunch of staff, most of whom don’t know the real reason for their existence because I think Gold Medallion actually does provide male escorts. It’s a legitimate site with legitimate employees, providing a legitimate service. But the employees don’t realize that I’m their most important client, and that in fact, the whole thing was set up for me.

After all, a man has needs and my handlers know that. Where was I going to meet someone special? While holding meetings with four-star generals? While attending the Olympics in some far-flung country? No, I have desires just like any other red-blooded man, and as a result, the Office of Professional Ethics set up Gold Medallion specifically to meet those needs."
B07BQCP82B3,B07BQCP82B,"After all, I am the President of the United States, and I have the Secret Service, FBI and the CIA at my fingertips. The spy agencies work for me and it’s no big deal to them to whip up a dossier on Ms. Bridget Martin, copy editor at the Star Gazette in New York City. In fact, I was looking through her profile right before she got here, and it’s impressive how little there is. Usually, I’m digging through at least two inches of material on this or that Russian operative, but with Bridget Martin, things were refreshingly lean and simple.

After all, no one’s going to let the President of the United States date a girl with a sketchy past. Royals in Europe now marry reality TV stars as well as actresses that have no work history, but that doesn’t hold when it comes to POTUS. Because there’s a big difference – no one can unseat a prince or princess, whereas I’m up for reelection in about three years. So yeah, my party’s not going to jeopardize our platform on some floozy who doesn’t know up from down. Instead, the girls are vetted so thoroughly that they practically qualify for top-secret clearance by the time it’s all over."
B00K0OI42W0,B00K0OI42W,"I never looked forward more to anything in my life. Hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on multitudes of children through a two-power telescope Jem had given me, learning their games, following Jem’s red jacket through wriggling circles of blind man’s buff, secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories. I longed to join them.

Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by one’s parents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room was. I think some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted around the corner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jem’s pockets. When we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that during school hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life, or tag along behind him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone."
B00K0OI42W1,B00K0OI42W,"Boo’s transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jem’s memory. Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he didn’t take Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county.

Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of sight, but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time. Atticus said no, it wasn’t that sort of thing, that there were other ways of making people into ghosts.

My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk to the edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I would see Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie Crawford said he was so upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we believed her, because Mr. Radley’s posture was ramrod straight.

He never spoke to us."
B00K0OI42W2,B00K0OI42W,"The town decided something had to be done; Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he was bound and determined they wouldn’t get away with it, so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, assault and battery, and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female. The judge asked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge; Mr. Conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them. The judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school, where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr. Radley thought it was. If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it that Arthur gave no further trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radley’s word was his bond, the judge was glad to do so.

The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on weekdays as well as Sundays, and Mr. Radley’s boy was not seen again for fifteen years.

But there came a day, barely within Jem’s memory, when Boo Radley was heard from and was seen by several people, but not by Jem."
B00K0OI42W3,B00K0OI42W,"Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events: people’s chickens and household pets were found mutilated; although the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned himself in Barker’s Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the children: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked.

The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. The Radleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection unforgivable in Maycomb. They did not go to church, Maycomb’s principal recreation, but worshiped at home; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a mid-morning coffee break with her neighbors, and certainly never joined a missionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to town at eleven-thirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I never knew how old Mr. Radley made his living—"
B00FO60CHQ0,B00FO60CHQ,"Three other men took off their shoes, and when the first returned with water, washed their hands. Four white prayer shawls were then procured and these the four shoeless men threw over their heads—not their shoulders, their heads—and took their places on the rug, where they prayed in silence, facing the wall.

Now the Vodzher Rebbe began a different kind of chant, composed of short phrases, whereupon the four beshrouded Jews turned to face the congregation and, bowing from the waist, extended their arms to form a kind of cloth tent which hid their faces but allowed their voices to sound forth, and from this strange position they uttered a series of moving cries, meaningless but profound. Cullinane stared at the ghostly figures—these headless Jews lost in their shrouds—and wondered what their performance could signify. It was archaic, passionate, a group of voices shouting some message from the most ancient history of man, and finally the shawls were dropped back over the heads and the voices ceased. The ceremony, whatever it was, had ended, and seventeen different men moaned and grumbled and argued their way to the conclusion of seventeen different services. The rebbe mumbled a prayer and the synagogue service ended."
B00FO60CHQ1,B00FO60CHQ,"Here there was no organization, no systematic division and no apparent beauty. The voices of women were absent. The beadle shuffled up and down, the old rebbe prayed on his own, and each man was his separate synagogue. He looked at the two men in the corner, still arguing their business problem, and he concluded that while Judaism might be meaningful for Paul Zodman it could never substitute for the controlled beauty of Catholicism.

Then just as he was dismissing the religion, a moment arrived that he would never forget, one of the supreme religious experiences of his life. In later years, as he dug through the layers of Jewish history at Makor, it would return at unexpected times to illuminate his understanding. It started simply. The beadle shuffled up to an old man sitting beside Zodman and indicated that he must take off his shoes. The old Jew did so and the beadle banged his way to a little closet under the niche, and while the others prayed he rattled a chain of keys, finally selecting one that unlocked the closet doors, behind which hung a copper pot. This he handed to the man, who went to a spigot outside the door as the beadle threw down a narrow rug."
B00FO60CHQ2,B00FO60CHQ,"Along the sides stood stone benches, hundreds of years old, and on them sat a collection of men who seemed even older: they were bearded, rheumy-eyed and stooped; they wore long black coats and caps trimmed with fur; some had prayer shawls of white wool striped with black. But they were primarily conspicuous because long and sometimes beautiful curls dangled beside their ears, and as they sat they prayed, moving their bodies back and forth in a series of compulsive jerks.

They were Hasidic Jews who gathered about the Rebbe of Vodzh, a holy man who had emigrated from the Russian town of Vodzh many years before, bringing with him these old men and others who were now dead. The famous little man sat huddled by himself, wrapped in a prayer shawl, only his piercing blue eyes visible through a white beard and side curls. He was known as the Vodzher Rebbe and this was his synagogue; but even more memorable was his beadle, a tall, cadaverous man with no teeth and a filthy robe with a hem so stiff with dirt that it scraped the floor. He wore cracked shoes that squeaked as he made his way from one routine job to the next, and his fur cap was moth-eaten and bedraggled."
B00FO60CHQ3,B00FO60CHQ,"He stood for some minutes in the roadway, looking; then without speaking he moved in among the trees, feeling their stout trunks and looking up at their piney needles. Some resin attached to his fingers and he tasted it. He kicked at the earth and saw how a humus had begun to form, a mulch that would hold water and prevent the floods that used to ravage this area. He turned to look back at the people he was employing to dig at Makor, but his throat was too choked with emotion for him to speak, so he resumed his contemplation of the trees.

At this point Tabari had arranged for a troupe of children to come running through the forest—none had been there for months and their childish voices began to echo among the trees. Zodman turned with surprise as they ran past, and he caught a little girl, red-cheeked and pudgy. She knew no English and he no Hebrew, but they looked at each other for a moment; then she struggled to pull away, but Tabari had coached her and now, over Zodman’s shoulder, the Arab made a sign and the child kissed the American. Zodman drew the little girl to him and bowed his head. He let her go and she ran after the others to where a car would return them to their village."
B01M1G2SV60,B01M1G2SV6,"This could be a job she could actually enjoy and take pride in.

Light streamed into the temple through its wide windows, splashing the tiled floor with brief warmth before a patch of clouds rushed to conceal the sun. Just as Nikki was about to leave the building, she finally received a reply to her earlier message to Olive.

Where’s Southall?

The question surprised Nikki. Surely in their years of friendship, Nikki had mentioned Southall to Olive? Then again, she and Olive had met in secondary school, years after Nikki’s parents had deemed these Punjabi day trips too much trouble, so Olive was spared Nikki’s complaints about wasting a perfectly good Saturday on the hunt for high quality coriander powder and mustard seeds.

Nikki stopped and looked around. She was surrounded by women with their heads covered – women hurrying after their toddlers, women giving each other sideways glances , women hunched over walking frames. Each one had a story. She could see herself addressing a room full of these Punjabi women. Her senses became overwhelmed with the colour of their kameezes, the sound of fabric rustling and pencils tapping, the smell of perfume and turmeric. Her purpose came into sharp focus."

Ever wanted to write? A new workshop on narrative techniques, character and voice. Tell your story! Workshops will culminate in an anthology of best work.

A handwritten scrawl below the print read: Class open to women only. Instructor needed. Paid position, two days weekly. Please contact Kulwinder Kaur at the Sikh Community Association.

There was no mention of qualifications or prior experience, which was an encouraging sign. Nikki pulled out her phone and typed in the phone number to save it. She noticed the man’s curious gaze but she ignored him and fell in step with a current of worshippers who had emerged from the langar hall.

Could she run a writing workshop? She had contributed a piece to the UK Fem Fighters’ blog, comparing her experiences with catcalling in Delhi and London, which had enjoyed three days on the Most Read Posts list. Surely she could give writing tips to some temple women? Perhaps publish An Anthology of Best Work. Editorial credentials would sit well on her bare résumé. Hope flittered in her chest."

I like the occasional Bollywood film but usually watch romantic comedies and action films. I’ve done a bit of travelling but I’ve put off seeing more of the world until I find The One to accompany me on the most important journey: life.

Nikki cringed at the last line but it was the sort of thing her sister would consider profound. She surveyed the board again. If she walked away without posting this profile, Mindi would find out and pester her until she returned to finish the job. If she posted it, Mindi might end up settling for one of these men. Longing for a cigarette, Nikki chewed on her thumbnail. Finally she tacked the profile on the marriage board but on its farthest corner where it was virtually invisible, overlapping with the scant flyers on the Community Notices board. Technically, she had carried out her task as instructed.

There was the sound of throat clearing. Nikki turned to find herself facing a wispy man. He shrugged awkwardly as if responding to a question. Nikki gave a polite nod and looked away but then he spoke."

B003VPWX6K0,B003VPWX6K,"Naturally, I felt the temptation to deny immediately and unambiguously such motivations as my employer was imputing to me, but saw in time that to do so would be to rise to Mr Farraday’s bait, and the situation would only become increasingly embarrassing. I therefore continued to stand there awkwardly, waiting for my employer to give me permission to undertake the motoring trip.

Embarrassing as those moments were for me, I would not wish to imply that I in any way blame Mr Farraday, who is in no sense an unkind person ; he was, I am sure, merely enjoying the sort of bantering which in the United States, no doubt, is a sign of a good, friendly understanding between employer and employee, indulged in as a kind of affectionate sport. Indeed, to put things into a proper perspective, I should point out that just such bantering on my new employer ’s part has characterized much of our relationship over these months – though I must confess, I remain rather unsure as to how I should respond. In fact, during my first days under Mr Farraday, I was once or twice quite astounded by some of the things he would say to me. For instance, I once had occasion to ask him if a certain gentleman expected at the house was likely to be accompanied by his wife."
B003VPWX6K1,B003VPWX6K,"But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part, in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer, to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request. So it was that in indicating my reasons for preferring the West Country for my motoring, instead of leaving it at mentioning several of the alluring details as conveyed by Mrs Symons’s volume, I made the error of declaring that a former housekeeper of Darlington Hall was resident in that region. I suppose I must have been intending to explain to Mr Farraday how I would thus be able to explore an option which might prove the ideal solution to our present small problems here in this house. It was only after I had mentioned Miss Kenton that I suddenly realized how entirely inappropriate it would be for me to continue. Not only was I unable to be certain of Miss Kenton’s desire to rejoin the staff here, I had not, of course, even discussed the question of additional staff with Mr Farraday since that first preliminary meeting over a year ago. To have continued pronouncing aloud my thoughts on the future of Darlington Hall would have been, to say the very least, presumptuous. I suspect, then, that I paused rather abruptly and looked a little awkward."
B003VPWX6K2,B003VPWX6K,"In the end, I decided the most prudent moment in the day would be as I served afternoon tea in the drawing room. Mr Farraday will usually have just returned from his short walk on the downs at that point, so he is rarely engrossed in his reading or writing as he tends to be in the evenings. In fact, when I bring in the afternoon tea, Mr Farraday is inclined to close any book or periodical he has been reading, rise and stretch out his arms in front of the windows, as though in anticipation of conversation with me.

As it was, I believe my judgement proved quite sound on the question of timing; the fact that things turned out as they did is entirely attributable to an error of judgement in another direction altogether. That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a light-hearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all."
B003VPWX6K3,B003VPWX6K,"It was thus that I had been able to gain some sense of the sort of place Miss Kenton had gone to live her married life. But this was, as I say, back in the thirties, when as I understand, Mrs Symons’s books were being admired in houses up and down the country. I had not looked through those volumes for many years, until these recent developments led me to get down from the shelf the Devon and Cornwall volume once more. I studied all over again those marvellous descriptions and illustrations, and you can perhaps understand my growing excitement at the notion that I might now actually undertake a motoring trip myself around that same part of the country.

It seemed in the end there was little else to do but actually to raise the matter again with Mr Farraday. There was always the possibility, of course, that his suggestion of a fortnight ago may have been a whim of the moment, and he would no longer be approving of the idea. But from my observation of Mr Farraday over these months, he is not one of those gentlemen prone to that most irritating of traits in an employer – inconsistency."
B0192CTMYG0,B0192CTMYG,"In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.

A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.

Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him."
B0192CTMYG1,B0192CTMYG,"Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it.

The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them. . . .

How very wrong he was.

Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead."
B0192CTMYG2,B0192CTMYG,"He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.

He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . .

He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door."
B0192CTMYG3,B0192CTMYG,"Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.

He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying."
B07B3FCTHN0,B07B3FCTHN,"Except… he no longer looked like the kid I had saved. Somehow, he was now a tall, strapping twenty-year-old. His dark hair and dark eyes didn’t scream bad boy – but he seemed like the guy who would steal the bad boy’s lunch money. Changed, I thought to myself as I let my eyes roam.

The Huntress – an assassin who had worked for Rumpelstiltskin – once an enemy, but now friend, and babysitter for Alex – not that he needed that kind of help any longer. She was watching Alex out of the corner of her eye, and she looked deeply concerned. Troubled. Change.

Alucard – once an enemy vampire – now a Daywalker, and ally. Change.

I realized everyone was staring at me, and that they probably mistook my silence for aloof drunkenness. I sighed. Damn stereotypes. I stood, clearing my throat. I turned to Ashley and Gunnar, opened my mouth to speak and… the words died on my tongue. Because they were staring at me, and the compassion in their eyes told me that nothing needed to be said.

At least between us three.

But the crowd did need to hear something.

I turned to the crowd."
B07B3FCTHN1,B07B3FCTHN,"I’d said it all before, and this was their wedding. It felt hollow to repeat the same platitudes here, now.

All too soon, Tory wrapped up and the guests gave light applause. Ashley’s eyes were misty and Gunnar was smiling at Tory.

Tory had grown a lot since we first met – that night on the Eads Bridge where we had fought against a silver dragon during a high-speed car chase. Tory had never seen a dragon before, but that hadn’t stopped her from doing her best to help Gunnar and I kick its ass. Afterwards, Tory had taken the biggest risk of her life and revealed her powers to the two strangers who had saved her. She’d bent a thick bar of metal as easily as a clothes hanger, and we had officially adopted her into our new club. Just the three of us back then. And look at how big our club was now.

My gaze swept the room, picking out several faces.

Alex – the kid we had saved from the Land of the Fae – a victim of the changeling operation the Queens still practiced. We had saved him, and then I had kind of adopted him."
B07B3FCTHN2,B07B3FCTHN,"Not some commercialized hot spring, but literal springs hidden within the mountains that you had to go and find for yourself.

I had placed wards on the property so that no magic could come within five miles. Hell, even I couldn’t Shadow Walk there to pester them. They had a week of sheer bliss ahead of them.

Until Fuck-stick McWolf decided to make a play for power.

And I had been told to stay out of it. In fact, my close friendship with Gunnar might have even led to this confrontation. I needed to remain far away from it all. As did my friends.

Which made me want to go pick a fight with someone.

I scanned the room angrily, but none of the faces immediately pissed me off enough to kill. With a start, I realized that Raego had never shown up. He had told me he couldn’t make the wedding due to travel, but that he would be back in time for the reception.

But… I scanned the room again. He wasn’t here.

I unlocked my phone with a swipe of my thumb, typed in the code, and dialed the scaly bastard. I turned away from the crowd, swept up my drink, and walked away for privacy. He answered on the second ring."
B07B3FCTHN3,B07B3FCTHN,"For him to prove both his power and his leadership skills.

It was an election in its most primal form.

A fight to the death.

I grumbled angrily, not familiar with feeling impotent when my friends were threatened.

I had reserved a private plane to take him to a remote, massive hunting lodge in the Rocky Mountains. The fridge was stocked with a week’s worth of exquisite meals, and the grills were equipped to handle as much meat as they wanted to hunt and cook if they preferred that instead. The nearest house was five miles away, leaving them in the dangerous wilderness all alone.

So they could get their wolf on and hunt to their heart’s content.

The place was packed with movies, music, blankets, and anything else they might need for their trip – even their luggage.

They literally had to hop on the plane – with nothing in hand – and they would arrive in their own personal paradise. The benefit to the lodge was that it was notorious for large hunting parties. Wild game abounded in the nearby mountains, and natural hot springs were only a few miles away if they wanted to check that out."
B079WCFZB80,B079WCFZB8,"No, he had to focus on what he knew.

What he knew was that Ran’dolphinius had in all likelihood saved lives in the village with his contributions. The chamberlain had made sure that hundreds of people had been fed, clothed and sheltered for months. He had been a blessing to the Mist Village.

There was also the point that Richter wouldn’t even be facing this choice if Ran’dolphinius hadn’t decided to be honest with him. The man had shown him trust. It might just be the Universe exerting its hidden rules, forcing the Spy to come clean since their official relationship had improved from Admiring to Trusting. Even if that was true though, it didn’t mean that Randy’s regret for deceiving him wasn’t real. On the contrary, it might just ensure that the man was telling the truth.

Of course, the most important thing was the Blood Oath. Richter had made one himself, and the consequences for failure were severe. His Oath hadn’t even involved calling on the Universe or a Place of Power. Words had power. With what Ran’dolphinius had just promised, Richter couldn’t even imagine what the consequences of breaking such an Oath would be…

He came to a decision."
B079WCFZB81,B079WCFZB8,"Ran’dolphinius wasn’t just someone who relayed information. The fucking Universe had assigned him that Specialty! What did that say about him as a person? What did that say about the man’s soul?

Part of Richter itched to attack, if only because it was an easy and definitive option. His nerves were still raw from a day of battle. The short sleep had taken the edge off, but even with his Belt of Sustenance, he needed more rest. Yes, a part of Richter just wanted to take a potentially troubling piece off the chessboard. That made him think about how he really should invent chess in The Land. It wasn’t just a relaxing game, it was a great way to…

The chaos seed shook his head. He was more tired than he thought if his mind could wander like that. Then his eyes narrowed. Or had he just gone off on a tangent because of some weird Spy Talent that the chamberlain had purchased? Was he being manipulated? Was his thinking about being manipulated a manipulation itself, aimed at keeping him off balance? Richter stared hard at Ran’dolphinius, then released his breath in a huff. He could go down that rabbit hole forever and keep falling."
B079WCFZB82,B079WCFZB8,"The eye of the Universe looked down upon him and the strings of fate drew taut as they awaited his decision. A pattern of importance would be woven into the skein of history tonight, and the tapestry would change based on his response.

Richter felt the import and yet still took his time to think. The Spy had been right, he had learned the importance of words in The Land, and he would not rush judgement in such an important moment. On the one hand, Ran’dolphinius had deceived him. The man wasn’t even human, and Undines weren’t even a race he was familiar with. A half-elf, or even a half-orc, wouldn’t be a person he would dismiss out of hand. But what if Randolphus - Ran’dolphinius, Richter corrected himself again - thought in an alien way because he was half-elemental? Did that make him half-monster?

Perhaps even more troubling was the second Oath that the chamberlain couldn’t tell him about. It was more than just a small cause for concern. What if that Oath was something horrible like killing all humans? What if it was to infiltrate other villages and kingdoms, being loyal until he could sell them out to Yves? The man was a damn Spy, after all. Not trusting him was kind of in the name."
B079WCFZB83,B079WCFZB8,"The two men made eye contact and Ran’dolphinius slowly stood. Richter matched him, at long last letting go of the dagger still under his pillow. It wasn’t that he doubted the deadliness of the Spy, but he just didn’t believe the man would attack him. Whatever else Randy was, he was a man of honor.

As they stood to their full heights, Richter received another small surprise. The chamberlain had always been a bit taller than him, but with the glamour fallen away, the chaos seed now overtopped him by at least four inches. Somehow, that didn’t take away from the power or strength that the half-undine exuded though.

Slowly, so that he didn’t startle Richter, the chamberlain took his pen and drew the point across the surface of his palm. Though his skin had a blue undertone, the blood welling was as dark red as any human’s. The metal nib sliced through the flesh as easily as a scalpel and Richter realized anew just how precarious his position would be if the Spy chose to attack him. Ran’dolphinius turned his hand to the side, and the blood began to fall in a slow pat, pat, pat onto the stone of the floor."
B06WP486XH0,B06WP486XH,"Maybe a very bad day.

But who cared, really?

The seven guys fanned out in a semicircle, three on Jimmy Rat’s left, and three on his right. Reacher kept moving, rotating them the way he wanted, his back to the street. He didn’t want to get trapped against someone’s rear fence. He didn’t want to get jammed in a corner. He didn’t plan on running, but an option was always a fine thing to have.

The seven guys tightened their semicircle, but not enough. They stayed about ten feet away, with better than a yard between each one of them. Which made the first two plays obvious. They would come shuffling in, slowly, maybe grunting and glaring, whereupon Reacher would move fast and punch his way through the line, after which everyone would turn around, Reacher now facing a new inverted semicircle, now only six in number. Then rinse and repeat, which would reduce them to five. They wouldn’t fall for it a third time, so at that point they would swarm, all except Jimmy Rat, who Reacher figured wouldn’t fight at all. Too smart. Which in the end would make it a close-quarters four-on-one brawl.

A bad day.

For someone."
B06WP486XH1,B06WP486XH,"It was as huge as all the others, but the footrests and the handlebars were set a little closer to the seat than most. About two inches closer than the new guy’s, for example. Which made Jimmy Rat about five-eight, possibly. Maybe skinny, to go with his name. Maybe armed, with a knife or a gun. Maybe vicious.

Reacher walked to the door of the bar. He pulled it open and stepped inside. The air was dark and hot and smelled of spilled beer. The room was rectangular, with a full-length copper bar on the left, and tables on the right. There was an arch in the rear wall, with a narrow corridor beyond. Restrooms and a pay phone and a fire door. Four windows. A total of six potential exits. The first thing an ex-MP counted.

The eight bikers were packed in around two four-tops shoved together by a window. They had beers on the go, in heavy glasses wet with humidity. The new guy was shoehorned in, pear shaped on a chair, with the fullest glass. Six of the others were in a similar category, in terms of size and shape and general visual appeal. One was worse. About five-eight, stringy, with a narrow face and restless eyes.

Reacher stopped at the bar and asked for coffee."
B06WP486XH2,B06WP486XH,"Probably spent the first half of its watch ginning up municipal revenue with a radar gun out on the highway, now prowling the back streets of the towns in its jurisdiction. Showing the flag. Paying attention to the trouble spots. The cop inside turned his head and gazed at Reacher. The guy was nothing like the pawnbroker. He was all squared away. His face was lean, and his eyes were wise. He was sitting behind the wheel with a ramrod posture, and his haircut was fresh. A whitewall buzz cut. Maybe just a day old. Not more than two.

Reacher stood still and watched him roll away. He heard a motorcycle exhaust in the distance, coming closer, getting louder, heavy as a hammer. An eighth Harley came around the corner, as slow as gravity would allow, a big heavy machine, blatting and popping, the rider lying back with his feet on pegs way out in front. He leaned into a turn and slowed on the gravel. He was wearing a black leather vest over a black T-shirt. He parked last in line. His bike idled like a blacksmith hitting an anvil. Then he shut it down and hauled it up on its stand. Silence came back."
B06WP486XH3,B06WP486XH,"Something about the architecture made it clear it was dairy country. The shape of the stores looked like old-fashioned milking barns. The same DNA was in there somewhere.

There was a bar in a standalone wooden building, with a patch of weedy gravel for parking, and on the gravel were seven Harley-Davidsons, all in a neat line. Possibly not actual Hells Angels as such. Possibly one of many other parallel denominations. Bikers were as split as Baptists. All the same, but different. Apparently these particular guys liked black leather tassels and chromium plating. They liked to lie back and ride with their legs spread wide and their feet sticking out in front of them. Possibly a cooling effect. Perhaps necessary. Generally they wore heavy leather vests. And pants, and boots. All black. Hot, in late summer.

The bikes were all painted dark shiny colors, four with orange flames, three with rune-like symbols outlined in silver. The bar was dull with age, and some shingles had slipped. There was an air conditioner in one of the windows, straining to keep up, dripping water in a puddle below. A cop car rolled past, slowly, its tires hissing on the blacktop. County Police."
B07B42T4YD0,B07B42T4YD,"Judging by the eleven bandits it had silently disposed of just a while ago, Boxxy concluded they were tougher than the rabble it had dealt with until now. It estimated their Levels to be around 30 or 35 to 40 at most. But even if they were stronger than the other prey it had faced so far, hiding out among the tree branches and watching the caravan with a keen eye made them easy pickings. In the end, all their higher Levels did for them was raise the Mimic’s Job and Skill Levels as it quietly picked them off one by one.

But it appeared that a few of the rats were making their escape. The Mass Panic Spell Crystal was a bit too effective and had made them abandon what loyalty they had in favour of running for their lives. The Mimic would therefore have to hunt them down and kill them. After all, the last time it let someone escape like this, the result was a punitive force being organized to hunt it down. Needless to say, it wanted to avoid a repeat of that situation, as it might not escape with its life the next time around."
B07B42T4YD1,B07B42T4YD,"It then cracked open and released a wailing, piercing screech that was loud enough to rock one to their core.

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 6 seconds.]

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 7 seconds.]

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 6 seconds.]

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 8 seconds.]

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 5 seconds.]

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 7 seconds.]

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 8 seconds.]

[Your target has been crippled by fear for 5 seconds.]

[Proficiency level increased. Crystallize Magic is now Level 2. INT +2. WIS +2.]

Boxxy was extremely satisfied with the results of its first field test of the crystallized Mass Panic Spell. The spike in MP cost was well worth the additional range the combination afforded. The duration of the effect was somewhat random since it varied from person to person. At the very least it stuck to a range between five and eight seconds, so it wasn’t entirely unpredictable.

As for the actual impact the Spell was having on the Mimic’s targets, it was just as tasty as the monster expected."
B07B42T4YD2,B07B42T4YD,"He was left with three options.

First was to try to flush out the adventurers, and keep the cargo as intact as possible. They would reap the most profit, but his men would end up questioning his leadership if a lot of them ended up dying over it. This was the best short-term solution but would sow seeds of discontent among the survivors, which would likely become trouble further down the line.

The second was to bombard the carts from afar with magic. Their magic users would try to ward off the ranged attacks, but their MP would not hold out for long. This way they would suffer the least casualties but also have very little to show for their trouble. Some smart-arses would probably question his decision anyway, but he could just counter with how they were still alive because of it.

And the final option was to simply give up on the profits and withdraw – a sure-fire way to have his men turn on him, have a bounty put out on his head, and lose out on all the loot. He wasn’t even considering it, but it was still technically a choice, no matter how terrible it was."
B07B42T4YD3,B07B42T4YD,"They all wore mismatched equipment, ranging from pieces of full plate that belonged to the Imperial army to the sort of chainmail and padded leather armour typical for newbie adventurers. It was clearly gear pilfered from their previous victims, with the higher ranking among them getting the best bits.

However, regardless of how much their equipment varied from person to person, all of them had one thing in common. Each bandit wore a dark red cowl, hood, headband, or bandana – likely intended to be some sort of identifying gang sign. They also moved with a certain amount of coordination, which suggested they had been training in mixed unit tactics. This was extremely strange for criminal rabble like that. Then again, their thorough preparations were precisely the reason why their ambush had been so effective.

Once their half-encirclement was complete, they moved forward in a threatening manner, stopping some fifteen metres away from the adventurers. The atmosphere was tense, as neither side seemed willing to break the sudden standoff. The bandits were waiting for their leader’s command while the adventurers were busy catching their breaths. Even if the Ranger had spotted the attack, it had still been way too sudden, so her side took this opportunity to regroup and formulate a strategy."
B01HMXRVL80,B01HMXRVL8,"A-ma takes the chicken from the ruma and swiftly plucks the feathers from the twitching carcass. Then whack, whack, whack. The chicken pieces are thrown into the pot that dangles over the fire First Sister-in-law has been tending.

Twenty minutes later, A-ma ladles the soup into bowls. The men gather on one side of our family home; the women gather on the other side. We sit on our haunches to receive our bowls. The sounds of greedy slurping, sucking, and chewing are among the happiest I’ve heard in my life, yet frogs, mosquitoes, and night-calling birds alert me to how many sleep hours we’ve already missed. As I gnaw gristle from a bone, little sparks of ideas fly through my head. In my dream last night, the bad omen of seeing a dog on the roof told me I was going to get into trouble. And I did. But right now, in this second, each person in my family, as well as the ruma, has a piece of chicken to eat and rich broth to drink. That’s just like in my dream too. My fake dream . . . The one I lied about . . . But in that dream we each had a whole chicken. Still . . ."
B01HMXRVL81,B01HMXRVL8,"Its wings flap miserably, fruitlessly. The village elders—who lead us and care for us—step onto their verandas and descend the stairs. Soon other neighbors emerge from their homes and join us, because I’m not to be alone in my disgrace.

I see the blacksmith and his family, the best hunter and his family, Ci-teh and her parents, and Ci-teh ’s brother and his wife— Ci-do and Deh-ja—who sleep in the newlywed hut outside his parents’ house. Ci-do has always been nice to me, and I like Deh-ja. The hair on Ci-do’s face and scalp has grown long and unruly, because men must not shave or cut their hair once their wives are five months into their pregnancies. Our entire village is holding its collective breath—as it does every time a woman is pregnant—until Deh-ja’s baby is born, when it can be determined whether it was a good birth, meaning a perfect baby boy or even a girl, and not a bad birth, marking the arrival of what we call a human reject.

The ruma’s eyes bore into mine. He starts to shake, and the little pieces on his headdress and clothes rattle with him. My teeth chatter, I shiver, and I want to pee."
B01HMXRVL82,B01HMXRVL8,"When we step into our home, we’re all hungry, and the smell of the steamed rice First Sister-in-law has made is almost painful to inhale. But we still don’t get to eat. First Brother is sent outside to look for a chicken. Second Brother is given the job of pulling the ruma away from his evening pipe. Third Brother brushes a flat stone set into the hard-packed earth outside our door with the palm of his hand. A-ma sorts through her baskets, looking for herbs and roots, while First Sister-in-law stokes the fire. My young nieces and nephews gather around their a-mas’ legs, peeping at me, their eyes wide.

Second Brother returns with the ruma, who wears his ceremonial cloak—which is heavily decorated with feathers, bones, and the tails of small animals—and carries a staff made from a dried stalk of tule root. He is our intermediary between the spirit world—whether inside spirits like our ancestors or outside spirits who bring malaria, steal the breath from newborns, or devour the hearts of beloved grandfathers—and the world of human beings in Spring Well. Tonight he’s here for me.

My family gathers in the open area between the house and the newlywed huts, where my brothers sleep with their wives. First Brother holds the chicken by its legs."
B01HMXRVL83,B01HMXRVL8,"One day I’ll get to taste one of those. Maybe. Occasionally, we treat ourselves to scallion pancakes that an old Dai woman sells from a cart just to the left, inside the tea collection center courtyard. The aroma is enticing—not as rich as the grilled meat but cleanly fragrant with the smell of fresh eggs.

A-ma, my sisters-in-law, and I squat in the dirt as my a-ba and brothers take our bags through a set of double doors that lead to the weighing area. On the other side of the courtyard, I spot a boy about my age, lingering by a mountain of burlap bags filled with tea waiting to be transported to the big city of Menghai, where it’ll be processed in a government-run factory. His hair is as black as my own. He too is barefoot. I don’t recognize him from school. But I’m less interested in him as a person than I am in the steaming scallion pancake he holds in his tea-stained fingers. He looks around to make sure no one is watching—obviously missing me—before ducking out of sight behind the burlap mound. I get up, cross the courtyard, and peek around the corner of the wall of tea."
B000FBFMB60,B000FBFMB6,"The surgery was held at the edge of the big clearing at the foot of the hill, where the great fire of the Gathering burned at night. The damp air smelled of soot and the acrid scent of wet ashes, but the blackened patch of earth—some ten feet across, at least—was already disappearing under a crisscross of fresh branches and kindling. They’d have a time starting it tonight, I thought, if the drizzle kept up.

The gentleman with the hangover disposed of, there was a short lull, and I was able to give my attention to Murray MacLeod, who had set up shop a short distance away.

Murray had gotten an early start, I saw; the ground by his feet was dark, the scattered ashes sodden and squishy with blood. He had an early patient in hand, too—a stout gentleman whose red, spongy nose and flabby jowls gave testimony to a life of alcoholic excess. He had the man stripped to his shirt despite the rain and cold, sleeve turned up and tourniquet in place, the bleeding bowl held across the patient’s knees.

I was a good ten feet from the stool where Murray plied his trade, but could see the man’s eyes, yellow as mustard even in the dim morning light."
B000FBFMB61,B000FBFMB6,"No, I thought, watching the strong curve of her back as she lifted the heavy equipment over an entangling root that hunched across the trail. It wasn’t that. She might have reason to be concerned, but she wasn’t basically a fearful person.

Roger? On the face of it, it would seem that the best thing to do was to become pregnant again quickly, with a child that was definitely Roger’s. That would certainly help to cement their new marriage. On the other hand … what if she did? Roger would be more than pleased—but what about Jemmy?

Roger had sworn a blood oath, taking Jemmy as his own. But human nature was human nature, and while I was sure that Roger would never abandon or neglect Jemmy, it was quite possible that he would feel differently—and obviously differently—for a child he knew was his. Would Bree risk that?

On due consideration, I rather thought she was wise to wait —if she could. Give Roger time to feel a close bond with Jemmy, before complicating the family situation with another child. Yes, very sensible—and Bree was an eminently sensible person.

It wasn’t until we had arrived, finally, at the clearing where the morning surgeries were held that another possibility occurred to me."
B000FBFMB62,B000FBFMB6,"I dug about in the jumble of quilts, coming out finally with my tiny leather medicine pouch.

I said a brief prayer to St. Bride and slipped it round my neck and down inside the bodice of my dress. I was so much in the habit of wearing the amulet when I set out to practice medicine that I had almost ceased to feel ridiculous about this small ritual—almost. Bree was watching me, a rather odd look on her face, but she said nothing.

I didn’t, either; merely picked up my things and followed her across the clearing, stepping carefully round the boggiest spots. It wasn’t raining now, but the clouds sat on the tops of the trees, promising more at any moment, and wisps of mist rose from fallen logs and dripping bushes.

Why was Bree worrying about contraception? I wondered. Not that I didn’t think it sensible— but why now? Perhaps it was to do with the imminence of her wedding to Roger. Even if they had been living as man and wife for the last several months—and they had—the formality of vows spoken before God and man was enough to bring a new sobriety to even the giddiest of young people. And neither Bree nor Roger was giddy."
B000FBFMB63,B000FBFMB6,"I gave way without further demur, though I wondered a little at her alacrity. While Bree wasn’t squeamish about the exigencies of normal life, like skinning animals and cleaning fish, I knew the proximity of people with disfiguring conditions or obvious illness bothered her, though she did her best to disguise it. It wasn’t distaste, I thought, but rather a crippling empathy.

I lifted the kettle and poured freshly boiled water into a large, half-full jar of distilled alcohol, narrowing my eyes against hot clouds of alcoholic steam.

It was difficult to see so many people suffering from things that could have been easily treated in a time of antiseptics, antibiotics, and anesthesia— but I had learned detachment in the field hospitals of a time when such medical innovations were not only new but rare, and I knew both the necessity and the value of it.

I could not help anyone, if my own feelings got in the way. And I must help. It was as simple as that. But Brianna had no such knowledge to use as a shield. Not yet.

She had finished wiping down the stools, boxes, and other impedimenta for the morning surgery, and straightened up, a small frown between her brows."
B071W7C2CG0,B071W7C2CG,"I prayed that these words bore a good approximation of an Anglo-Irish accent, with which I assumed my carriage-mates spoke. My model was the Martyn family.

The Martyns. It pained me to conjure them up in any form, even as a reference point. Their actions were the cause of my departure. When rumors surfaced again about Dad’s years-earlier alignment with the Fenians—an Irish-led movement that maintained Ireland should be its own state, that farmers should have fair rent and fixity of tenure, and that all people should have rights and the ability to better themselves, it had arisen from the near nonexistent assistance offered by English leaders to the sufferers of the Irish famine—the Anglo-Irish Martyns retaliated. Bit by bit, the Martyns took away land from the twenty-acre tenant farm Dad had amassed, a size permitting the crop diversity that allowed our family to survive the famine, unlike so many with the standard one-acre tenancies that could grow one crop only, the decimated potato. Our family needed another source of income to bank against the reduction in the family’s earnings, and I was to be that other source. Lord Marytn, his wife, and their daughter might as well have placed me on the Envoy themselves and steered the ship through the rough Atlantic waters to America."
B071W7C2CG1,B071W7C2CG,"Wearing dresses with crinoline underskirts peeking out at the hem, thick silk sashes, high necklines with lace collars, and wide pagoda sleeves, the girls had clothes finer and more fashionable than anything I’d ever owned. Finer than anything I’d ever seen, in fact, except the two occasions I served as a temporary kitchen maid for a holiday meal at Castle Martyn, the medieval citadel owned by the Martyn family, who served as landlord to all the farmers in our region.

Who in the name of Mary was this Clara Kelley I’d become?

From their gawking, I saw that the girls found me as alien as I found them. But I could not let on, or I risked losing my place in the carriage. How could I best ensure that I stepped into the mysterious shoes that the other Clara left me to fill?

Not by speaking in my usual manner, that was for certain. These girls didn’t look as though their accents would match my farmer’s daughter ’s West Ireland lilt, no matter how posh our fellow neighbors found it compared to their own, thanks to Dad’s education of us girls. And I guessed the other Clara Kelley spoke like them. Not me.

Mrs. Seeley’s man poked his head into the carriage."
B071W7C2CG2,B071W7C2CG,"I’d assumed I would have to cobble together the cheapest route I could find, some combination of rail and canal rides and wagon, since the train route didn’t extend all the way from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. But now a complete stranger was offering me a continuous horse-drawn carriage ride across the Allegheny Mountains and seemingly not asking for payment. Would I be a fool to decline? Or would I be a fool to accept?

I had a choice. I could tell this man the truth. That I was not the Clara Kelley for whom he was looking. That Clara Kelley was a common enough name. That the second-class passenger Clara Kelley for whom he was waiting probably never made it off the ship ferrying her here from Ireland if he had not yet come across her. Cholera and typhoid took many of us from all classes of travel. Illness did not discriminate. It was perhaps the one thing that did not.

Or I could become that other Clara Kelley. At least until I got to Pittsburgh.

I stared at the black carriage, trying to decide. On board the Envoy, I had promised myself that I wouldn’t wait any longer, that I would take my future in my own hands when I could.

The man opened the door to the carriage for me."
B071W7C2CG3,B071W7C2CG,"A fellow Irishman had approached their nephew Anthony at the New York City docks, promising him a pleasant room at a reasonable rate, only to settle him in a rat-infested tenement room in the Lower East Side of the city that was already inhabited by nine other immigrants, at a rate many times more than what he had been told. When Anthony couldn’t meet the exorbitant payment, the runner tossed Anthony out onto the street, keeping his stored trunk—his only belonging in the New World—as final payment. The O’Donnells and Anthony’s poor parents had not heard from him since his last letter describing the machinations of this evil runner. This terrible fate wasn’t the worst an immigrant could expect. I overheard the O’Donnells whispering to my parents about a girl from a neighboring village traveling alone to Boston who encountered a runner who exacted a far worse penance from her than the confiscation of her luggage.

This man didn’t look the part. In fact, my little sister, Cecilia, would have called him posh, especially as he was leaning against a highly polished black livery coach with two dappled gray horses attached. And anyway, how would a runner know my name?"
B011G3HI9U0,B011G3HI9U,"Le Grenier lived in the shadow of the SS Normandie, in the attic of a former harbormaster’s building. When we exited the cab, the great ship rose high above us, deck bright with spotlights, four floors of portholes aglow. A welder at her bow sent apricot sparks into the night sky as deckhands lowered a spotlight down her side to painters on a scaffold. She made me feel small standing there, below that great, black prow, her three red smokestacks, each bigger than any of the warehouse buildings that extended down the pier. Salt hung in the end-of-summer air as Atlantic seawater met Hudson River fresh.

The tables at Le Grenier were packed with a nice enough looking crowd, mostly middle-class types, including a reporter from the gala and what looked like ocean-liner passengers happy to be on terra firma. We chose a tight, shellacked wooden booth, built like something from the inside of a ship, where every inch counts. Le Grenier’s maître d’, M. Bernard, fawned over M. Rodierre , told him he’d seen The Streets of Paris three times, and shared in great detail the specifics of his own Hoboken Community Theater career.

M. Bernard turned to me."
B011G3HI9U1,B011G3HI9U,"Fearing I’d only antagonize him further, I left M. Rodierre and the script backstage, trying to dismiss my brown-suede-shoe fixation. I hurried to the ballroom to see if Pia had executed my seating chart, more detailed and dangerous than a Luftwaffe flight plan. I saw she’d simply tossed several cards onto the six Rockefeller tables, so I rearranged them and took my place close to the stage between the kitchen and the head table. Three stories of red-draped boxes rose up around the vast room, each with its own dinner table. All seventeen hundred seats would be filled, a lot of unhappy people if all didn’t go well.

The guests assembled and took their seats, an ocean of white ties, old mine diamonds, and enough rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré gowns to clean out most of Paris’s best shops. The girdles alone would ensure both Bergdorf and Goodman reached their third-quarter sales goals.

A row of journalists collected alongside me, pulling their pencils out from behind their ears. The headwaiter stood poised at my elbow, awaiting the cue to serve. Elsa Maxwell entered the room—gossipmonger, professional party hostess, and self-promoter ne plus ultra. Would she remove her gloves to write terrible things about this night in her column or just memorize the horror of it all?"
B011G3HI9U2,B011G3HI9U,"The hallway outside our reception area was packed so tightly with people one could scarcely step through. Both the Normandie and the Ile de France, two of France’s premier ocean liners, had landed that morning in New York Harbor, packed with wealthy passengers fleeing the uncertainty in France. Once the all-clear horn signaled and they were free to disembark, the ships’ elite streamed to the consulate to iron out visa problems and other sticky issues.

I squeezed into the smoky reception area, past ladies in Paris’s newest day dresses who stood gossiping in a lovely cloud of Arpège, the sea spray still in their hair. The people in this group were accustomed to being shadowed by a butler with a crystal ashtray and a champagne flute. Bellboys in scarlet jackets from the Normandie went toe-to-toe with their black-jacketed counterparts from the Ile de France. I wedged one shoulder through the crowd, toward our secretary’s desk at the back of the room, and my chiffon scarf snagged on the clasp of one ravishing creature’s pearls. As I worked to extract it, the intercom buzzed unanswered.

Roger.

I pressed on through, felt a pat on my behind, and turned to see a midshipman flash a plaquey smile."
B011G3HI9U3,B011G3HI9U,"My first consulate gala was no time to stand on ceremony.

I joined the riptide of the great unwashed moving up Fifth Avenue. Men in gray-felted fedoras pushed by me, the morning papers in their attachés bearing the last benign headlines of the decade. There was no storm gathering in the east that day, no portent of things to come. The only ominous sign from the direction of Europe was the scent of slack water wafting off the East River.

As I neared our building at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-ninth Street, I felt Roger watching from the window above. He’d fired people for a lot less than being twenty minutes late, but the one time of year the New York elite opened their wallets and pretended they cared about France was no time for skimpy boutonnières.

I turned at the corner, the morning sun alive in the gold-leaf letters chiseled in the cornerstone: LA MAISON FRANÇAISE. The French Building, home to the French Consulate, stood side by side with the British Empire Building, facing Fifth Avenue, part of Rockefeller Center, Junior Rockefeller’s new complex of granite and limestone. Many foreign consulates kept offices there then, resulting in a great stew of international diplomacy."
B073VXTLJV0,B073VXTLJV,"She looked around the room and thought of taking her children, the recent children, to these same galleries years ago. She remembered that unexpected sense of comfort in standing among these ruins, an inexpressible relief that she couldn’t explain even to herself. Naturally Elazar understood it immediately. He always noticed patterns, and their absence. He used to open up her father’s scrolls in front of her, noting oddities. Why did he write here that there were seven of every clean animal in the ark, but in the previous column he wrote that there were only two? A simple mistake like that, can’t he change it? Tell him we want a corrected copy. She would read over his shoulder, follow, argue. You want it to be perfect, but that’s not the point, she would insist, but still she brought the scrolls and questions back to her father. It’s not my job to change it, her father would mutter—though she knew he did change things sometimes, when he felt he had to. And not his either. Go tell him to learn from his own father. He’s inheriting a far more important job than mine. Her father was right about that, of course: deeply, profoundly right. Until he wasn’t. And then, sometimes, she would change the scrolls herself."
B073VXTLJV1,B073VXTLJV,"She didn’t know exactly when she had first felt the sensation of regret. It was a physical sensation, a shudder that began deep in the stomach and traveled up through the throat; it was distinct from remorse, which one felt first in the throat and only later in the gut. Yet it was regret that she couldn’t handle. She did anything she could to avoid it—including the initial bargain, the one that began everything. And now this one.

Meet me in twenty minutes, the text on her phone read. You know where.

She knew, of course. No, she tapped back. Not now.

Now, the text replied.

This was the problem, always. And all this time she had never found a way out. More words appeared on the phone’s screen, unbidden: Unless you want me to come to you.

No thank you, she responded. Wait for me. I’ll come. She always did.

HE HAD FOUND HER coming out of the office one cold evening when she had been working alone. Mort was dead three years already, the business was just beginning to fail, and she was thinking about leaving. But she couldn’t leave just then, just when everyone and everything was poised at the edge of ruin; she couldn’t do that to them."
B073VXTLJV2,B073VXTLJV,"New parents think of each day as a cascade of beginnings: the first time she smiled, the first time she rolled over, her first steps, her first words, her first day of school. But old parents like her saw only endings: the last time she crawled, the last time she spoke in a pure raw sound unsculpted into the words of others, the last time she stood before the world in braids and laughed when she shouldn’t have, not knowing. Each child died before the person did, a small rehearsal for the future.

She raised her children, all of them. She raised them, nurtured them, watched them love or hate or succeed or fail, gave each of them her private excesses of possibilities, observed, sometimes from afar, what they did with them, watched her own ideas wither or grow. Then she finally watched her children die, and she was jealous.

She would tell that granddaughter, she decided as she left the building, passing by the protestors. Yet it was this granddaughter, of all of her articulate descendants, who announced online to the universe:

My grandmother just told us she can’t sign off on her will because she CAN’T DIE. #crazyoldlady

Oh child , she thought, you have no idea just how crazy I am.

CHAPTER

2

THE INVENTION

OF REGRET

. . ."
B073VXTLJV3,B073VXTLJV,"With that sixty-third son’s wild brothers, she had lost her temper frequently, though the sixty-third son had been silent, almost ignored. Then one day he had stood up on a chair during a meal and declaimed a rhymed alphabetical list of all the curses she had hurled at him and his brothers, and she had laughed until her insides ached. Even now she felt a lightness when she thought of the books he wrote later, which still made her laugh. She had almost told him, but hadn’t in the end. He would have thought she was joking.

But this was the longest she had stayed anywhere, and these were the oldest grandchildren she had ever dared to know. The youngest one, sitting at the table before her—the one she had kept in reserve in her mind for years, just as she always chose one, the one she thought she could trust—that one was already over thirty, with children of her own. Perhaps she would tell that granddaughter. Or not, and simply leave without a word, as she usually did. Either way, she couldn’t stay much longer.

The day’s meeting had been awkward. Just getting into the office above the store had meant crossing through a line of seven people holding signs."
B000FC2L1Y0,B000FC2L1Y,"He was standing in the stream, six feet away, thigh-deep in the water, his genitals stiff and dark against the pallid glow of his body. His hair lay loose around his shoulders, framing a face white as bone, eyes unblinking and intent as those of the wolf-dog. Utter wildness, utter stillness.

Then he stirred and came toward me, still intent, but still no longer. His thighs were cold as water when he touched me, but within seconds he warmed and grew hot. Sweat sprang up at once where his hands touched my skin, and a flush of hot moisture dampened my breasts once more, making them round and slick against the hardness of his chest.

Then his mouth moved to mine and I melted—almost literally—into him. I didn’t care how hot it was, or whether the dampness on my skin was my sweat or his. Even the clouds of insects faded into insignificance. I raised my hips and he slid home, slick and solid, the last faint coolness of him quenched by my heat, like the cold metal of a sword, slaked in hot blood.

My hands glided on a film of moisture over the curves of his back, and my breasts wobbled against his chest, a rivulet trickling between them to oil the friction of belly and thigh."
B000FC2L1Y1,B000FC2L1Y,"Small clouds of gnats hovered over the water; I couldn’t see them, but I knew they were there by the occasional splash of leaping fish, rising to snatch them from the air.

The bugs had been a ubiquitous plague. I inspected Jamie’s skin minutely every morning, picking voracious ticks and wood fleas from his crevices, and anointed all of the men liberally with the juice of crushed pennyroyal and tobacco leaves. This kept them from being devoured alive by the clouds of mosquitoes, gnats, and carnivorous midges that hung in the sun-tinged shadows of the woods, but it didn’t prevent the hordes of inquisitive bugs from driving them mad with a constant tickling inquiry into ears, eyes, noses, and mouths.

Oddly enough, the majority of insects left me strictly alone. Ian joked that the strong scent of herbs that hung about me must repel them, but I thought it went further than that—even when I was freshly bathed, the insects showed no desire to bother me.

I thought it might be a manifestation of the evolutionary oddity that— I surmised— protected me from colds and minor illness here. Bloodthirsty bugs, like microbes, evolved very closely with humans, and were sensitive to the subtle chemical signals of their hosts. Coming from another time, I no longer had precisely the same signals, and consequently the bugs no longer perceived me as prey."
B000FC2L1Y2,B000FC2L1Y,"So near the coast, the sky was clear, and the stars shone overhead like diamonds, burning with a fierce, bright light.

A faint splash made me look toward the stream. Nothing moved on the surface but faint coruscations of starlight, caught like fireflies in a spider’s web.

As I watched, a great head broke water in the middle of the stream, water purling back from the pointed snout. There was a fish struggling in Rollo ’s jaws; the flap and gleam of its scales showed briefly as he shook his head violently to break its back. The huge dog swam slowly to the shore, shook his coat briefly, and stalked away, his evening meal dangling limp and shimmering from his jaws.

He paused for a moment on the far edge of the creek, looking at me, the ruff of his hackles a dark shadow framing yellow eyes and gleaming fish. Like a primitive painting, I thought; something from Rousseau, with its contrast of utter wildness and complete stillness.

Then the dog was gone, and there was nothing on the far shore but the trees, hiding whatever might lie behind them. And what did? I wondered. More trees, answered the logical part of my mind."
B000FC2L1Y3,B000FC2L1Y,"I had no soap, but knelt and rinsed my hair over and over in the clear dark water, and scrubbed my body with handfuls of fine sand, until my skin felt thin and glowing.

Finally, I climbed out onto a rocky shelf and lay languid as a mermaid in the moonlight, the heat of the air and the sun-warmed stone now a comfort to my chilled body. I combed out my thick curly hair with my fingers, scattering drops of water. The wet stone smelled like rain, dusty and tingling.

I felt very tired, but at the same time, very much alive, in that state of half consciousness where thought is slowed and small physical sensations magnified. I moved my bare foot slowly over the sandstone rock, enjoying the slight friction, and ran a hand lightly down the inside of my thigh, a ripple of goose bumps rising in the wake of my touch.

My breasts rose in the moonlight, cool white domes spangled with clear droplets. I brushed one nipple and watched it slowly stiffen by itself, rising as if by magic.

Quite a magical place at that, I thought. The night was quiet and still, but with a languid atmosphere that was like floating in a warm sea."
B01N4VW75U0,B01N4VW75U,"The upstairs had had a new tenant every year or so: a cellist who had just been hired to teach at the Institute of Music; a divorcée in her forties; a young newlywed couple fresh out of Cleveland State. Each of them had deserved a little booster, as she’d begun to think of it. But none of them stayed long. The cellist, denied first chair in the Cleveland Orchestra, left the city in a cloud of bitterness. The divorcée remarried after a whirlwind four-month romance and moved with her new husband to a brand-new McMansion in Lakewood. And the young couple, who had seemed so sincere, so devoted, and so deeply in love, had quarreled irreparably and separated after a mere eighteen months, leaving a broken lease, some shattered vases, and three cracked spots in the wall, head-high, where those vases had shattered.

It was a lesson, Mrs. Richardson had decided. This time she would be more careful. She asked Mr. Yang to patch the plaster and took her time finding a new tenant, the right sort of tenant. 18434 Winslow Road Up sat empty for nearly six months until Mia Warren and her daughter came along. A single mother, well spoken, artistic, raising a daughter who was polite and fairly pretty and possibly brilliant."
B01N4VW75U1,B01N4VW75U,"Over the years his accent had diminished only marginally, and when they spoke, Mrs. Richardson was sometimes reduced to nodding and smiling. But Mr. Yang was a good man, she felt; he worked very hard, driving a school bus to Laurel Academy, a nearby private girls’ school, and working as a handyman. Living alone on such a meager income, he would never have been able to live in such a nice neighborhood. He would have ended up in a cramped, gray efficiency somewhere off Buckeye Road, or more likely in the gritty triangle of east Cleveland that passed for a Chinatown, where rent was suspiciously low, every other building was abandoned, and sirens wailed at least once a night. Plus, Mr. Yang kept the house in impeccable shape, repairing leaky faucets, patching the front concrete, and coaxing the stamp-sized backyard into a lush garden. Every summer he brought her Chinese melons he had grown, like a tithe, and although Mrs. Richardson had no idea what to do with them—they were jade green, wrinkled, and disconcertingly fuzzy— she appreciated his thoughtfulness anyway. Mr. Yang was exactly the kind of tenant Mrs. Richardson wanted: a kind person to whom she could do a kind turn, and who would appreciate her kindness.

With the upstairs apartment she had been less successful."
B01N4VW75U2,B01N4VW75U,"The rent—all five hundred dollars of it in total—now went into the Richardsons’ vacation fund each month, and last year it had paid for their trip to Martha’s Vineyard, where Lexie had perfected her backstroke and Trip had bewitched all the local girls and Moody had sunburnt to a peeling crisp and Izzy, under great duress, had finally agreed to come down to the beach —fully clothed, in her Doc Martens, and glowering. But the truth was, there was plenty of money for a vacation even without it. Because they did not need the money from the house, it was the kind of tenant that mattered to Mrs. Richardson. She wanted to feel that she was doing good with it. Her parents had brought her up to do good; they had donated every year to the Humane Society and UNICEF and always attended local fund-raisers, once winning a three-foot-tall stuffed bear at the Rotary Club’s silent auction. Mrs. Richardson looked at the house as a form of charity. She kept the rent low—real estate in Cleveland was cheap, but apartments in good neighborhoods like Shaker could be pricey — and she rented only to people she felt were deserving but who had, for one reason or another, not quite gotten a fair shot in life. It pleased her to make up the difference.

Mr. Yang had been the first tenant she’d taken after inheriting the house; he was an immigrant from Hong Kong who had come to the United States knowing no one and speaking only fragmentary, heavily accented English."
B01N4VW75U3,B01N4VW75U,"Instead of wheeling your cart out to the parking lot, a cart boy in a pressed poplin shirt hung a number on it and handed you a matching red-and-white tag. Then you hooked the tag on the window of your car and drove up to the front of the store, where another cart boy would wheel your groceries out to you and pack them tidily into your trunk and refuse to accept a tip.

They learned where the cheapest gas station was—at the corner of Lomond and Lee Roads, always one cent less than anywhere else; where the drugstores were and which gave double coupons. They learned that in nearby Cleveland Heights and Warrensville and Beachwood, residents placed their discarded belongings at the curb like ordinary people, and they learned which days were garbage days on which streets. They learned where to buy a hammer, a screwdriver, a quart of new paint and a brush: all could be found at Shaker Hardware, but only between the hours of nine thirty and six P.M., when the owner sent his employees home for dinner.

And, for Pearl, there was the discovery of their landlords, and of the Richardson children.

Moody was the first of the Richardsons to venture to the little house on Winslow. He had heard his mother describing their new tenants to his father."
B077V6QBZR0,B077V6QBZR,"He releases my hair to grip both my hips, pulling them back against him hard as he finally stills.

For long moments, I wait for my heart to burst because it can’t handle the beating, but finally, it slows.

This is a moment I’m not prepared for. I don’t know what to say. What to do. What to think. How to justify this aberration in my carefully plotted life.

What the hell did I do?

The intensity of the moment fractures as he steps away, the thick length of his cock pulling out of my body. I wait for two long seconds before I flip my skirt down and push off the desk. I have to get out of here.

A quick look over my shoulder shows me that his back is turned as he walks toward a door I didn’t notice. My logical thoughts are momentarily derailed as my gaze locks on the flex of his perfectly formed ass. Jesus Christ, how is that fair?

It doesn’t matter. I have to go. This never should have happened.

I tear my eyes off his ass, grab my bag, snag my pumps, and bolt for the door barefoot. He doesn’t notice my escape until I yank it open."
B077V6QBZR1,B077V6QBZR,"My tone is pure challenge, more suited to the rebellious teen of my misspent youth than the professional woman I am today.

It must be the right answer, though, because it unleashes the beast behind me. My stranger draws back before fucking into me with a measured rhythm of deep and then shallow strokes. He relentlessly hits the spots that light my body up. The man has skills.

It’s the last coherent thought I have as my fingers tighten around the edge of the desk. My head begs to thrash from side to side but is pinned in place by his hand.

He’s taking me. Owning me. Dominating me. Leaving me no choice but to take the fucking he’s delivering.

And I love it.

Another orgasm builds and threatens to shatter my grip, and when he changes his pattern, my body is thrown into a new level of chaos.

Thrust after thrust, I can’t even understand the babbling words spilling from my lips.

I can’t stop coming. These aren’t multiples . . . they’re continuous, and I’m a writhing, moaning body without any coherent thought beyond—don’t stop.

He doesn’t. My control shatters along with my grip.

The blood pounding through my head deafens me, but not enough to miss his roar of ecstasy just before he thrusts slow and shallow."
B077V6QBZR2,B077V6QBZR,"My heart thumps harder as he reaches for the flap of his leathers with his other hand and yanks it open, freeing his heavy cock.

I bite down on my lower lip to stifle the hushed oh my God dying to break free. The sting from my teeth serves as a reminder that this isn’t one of my dreams.

This is real.

My conscience wars with me, telling me to turn away. Go back down the stairs. Run out the front door. Find my car and get the hell out of here.

But that and any other thought of business dies away as he wraps one palm around his thick cock and gives it a rough tug before thumbing the tip. The ruddy reddish-purple shaft seems to pulse against his grip, and my lip trembles as my thighs clench.

Why is it so frigging hot to see a man handle himself like that?

Using his grip on her hair, he guides her lips toward the head.

Sweet Lord. I shouldn’t be turned on by this. But my sweaty palms and the thumping pulse that has taken up residence between my legs expose my lie.

This is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen in person."
B077V6QBZR3,B077V6QBZR,"A tingle of excitement, like I’ve just discovered a secret key to another world, shoots through me as the man shuts the door to their room and slowly circles the woman before pushing her to her knees with one dominant hand on each shoulder. He has the look of a conqueror inspecting his war prize, complete with tribal ink marking his chest and upper arms, and dark leather pants. It’s hot as hell.

The rational part of my brain says I should look away, not invade their private scene, but I glance quickly at the door I entered through. No one is bursting in to tell me it’s some kind of mistake that I was led here.

The woman, dressed in red lingerie, keeps her gaze downcast, but I’m not nearly as disciplined. I can’t take my eyes off her companion as his ass flexes against the leathers.

When he stops in front of her, he releases her shoulder and buries one hand in her honey-blond hair, gripping her at the base of her neck, forcing her attention to his face.

They are completely and utterly absorbed with each other, and neither of them spares even a glance at the wall that serves as my voyeuristic porthole. Do they know? They must.

His voice somehow comes loud and clear into this room."
B0781TFMFJ0,B0781TFMFJ,"The Kyleshiffin police station was a converted bungalow off Lady’s Wynd, which ran parallel to Harbour Street. Torquil was at work in his office poring over a map of the island, as he sought to ensure that there would be enough parking facilities. The influx of tourists and visitors from the ferry for the Gathering and Literary Festival had worried him since it had brought an unprecedented number of cars to the island. West Uist’s road system simply would not cope. He began to curse his uncle’s idea about the Literary Festival.

The commotion from the duty desk was not helping him concentrate. For five minutes he had worked on, hoping that PC Ewan McPhee would calm the situation, but instead, the latter’s voice seemed to be getting louder and louder and less controlled. With a sigh he laid down his pen, opened the door and walked into World War III.

It seemed as if a crowd of belligerent faces was haranguing Ewan , Torquil’s six-foot-four, red-maned constable. A champion hammer-thrower and Western Isles wrestling runner-up at the last Outer Hebrides Games, he was underneath it all a sensitive and self-effacing twenty-three-year-old. And indeed, although his voice was getting louder it seemed that it was desperation rather than anger that was behind the rise in decibels."
B0781TFMFJ1,B0781TFMFJ,"Flags and bunting hung from the lamp posts proclaiming a welcome in both English and Gaelic for the West Uist Gathering and Literary Festival. Locals and holiday makers ambled around market stalls clustered along the harbour wall, inspecting lobsters, crabs, local crafts and second-hand ephemera. Beyond the wall a flotilla of assorted fishing boats, yachts and launches bobbed up and down in the water, attesting to the fact that Kyleshiffin was both a working and a pleasure harbour.

Fiona Cullen’s Honda Fireblade roared along the crescent as she made her way to the Bonnie Prince Charlie Tavern, where she had booked a back room without the distraction of a sea view. She planned to do some serious work on her novel.

A slim leather-clad woman on a powerful machine, she attracted many appraising and admiring looks as she rode by. One such observer was Ranald Buchanan, the proprietor of the Kyleshiffin Antique Bookshop, Tobacconist and Fishing Tackle Emporium. As he looked over the shoulder of the customer he was serving he saw the Fireblade zip along the road, the svelte rider conjuring up the pleasing image of a Peter Pan on wheels in his artistic mind. Then he turned his attention back to the important matter in hand. Money"
B0781TFMFJ2,B0781TFMFJ,"To give a lecture, do a bit of plotting on the already overdue crime novel, and maybe even to see a few old friends — perhaps even one in particular. It had all seemed serendipitous, so right.

Catching the overnight ferry from Oban to Lochboisdale in South Uist had been the first part of her plan. She had powered up the west coast roads on her scarlet Honda Fireblade, boarding the ferry at the very last minute. She had avoided the crowded restaurant and bar to take a solitary supper of cheese sandwiches and coffee in her cabin. Upon arrival at Lochboisdale she had showered, drunk a cup of boiled water, and then found her way up to the viewing platform. It had all gone well until Genevieve Cooper spotted her from the lower deck.

Damn! This is going to be awkward, she thought to herself. How do I tell my agent it’s time to part company?

Genevieve arrived slightly breathless a few moments later, but not alone. She had a group of eager beavers with her. A coterie of literary groupies that she had undoubtedly ensnared over breakfast. Genevieve was good at that. A big woman in every sense of the word. Rubinesque and overbearing."
B0781TFMFJ3,B0781TFMFJ,"She had stood there smoking a cigarette, watching the hazy blue silhouette of West Uist slowly grow in size as the ferry ploughed through the waves towards it. She was an elegant, slim woman dressed in black motorcycle leathers. Strikingly attractive by any measure, the contrast of her black garb with her short-cut platinum-blonde hair made her stand out.

But to stand out at that moment was the last thing that Fiona wanted. Especially when her writing had thrust her into the limelight of celebrity. Newspaper, magazine and chat-show interviews had done well for her, had boosted her sales into a comfort zone and had opened doors into several areas of society. She had loved it all; revelled in each new experience that came along, the parties, the affairs, the betrayals and the deceits. All good plot material for a writer. Then things just seemed to get too complicated. There seemed to be so many things going on in her life, so many complex threads that had somehow merged together to make the tangled skein that she was now living through. She needed to get away, to sort out her head, to immerse herself in her writing. And that was why the Gathering and Literary Festival had seemed such a godsend."
B01K3WN90C0,B01K3WN90C,"But ask them what they think of the war in Syria and they’ll stare at you as if you’d just asked them to explain the theory of relativity. A handful of fish floating belly-up are a thousand times worse than a busload of women and children blown to smithereens in some far-off country.

But let’s not be hypocritical: I am enjoying the fish scandal immensely, I cannot pretend otherwise. The outrage that has overtaken the entire population here is remarkable. I’m about to go back down to the Conversation Lounge for some more juicy fish talk.

Winter has arrived. Not a flake of snow on the ground, but yesterday I saw the first old man stepping outside with wool socks pulled on over his shoes. To guard against slipping.

Tuesday, January 15

Here it is, the first snowfall of the year. Which means nobody ventures outside, and everyone’s stocking up on provisions. In our little shop downstairs there’s not a packet of cookies or bar of chocolate to be had anymore. The war, you know.

It’s lucky for today’s young people that we are just about the only ones left who’ve lived through the war; soon they won’t have to put up with any more old-fogeys’ tales about tulip-bulb soup and having to walk seven hours for a bunch of carrots."
B01K3WN90C1,B01K3WN90C,"He deposited the plastic wrapper neatly in the wastepaper basket—not such a bright way to dispose of the evidence, I suppose, but luckily the janitor has already been around to empty the trash containers.

The fish tank is tucked away in a rather dark corner, so no one noticed anything last night. The operation wasn’t without risk; if he’d been nabbed, he’d have been obliged to call in the moving van. Perhaps somewhere deep down he doesn’t care if he gets caught, even though whenever he’s in a tight spot he’ll lie through his teeth, and rant and rave, swearing he had nothing to do with it. That’s how the game is played, he says. His philosophy: the only point of being alive is to kill time as pleasantly as possible. The trick is not to take anything too seriously. I envy him. But I’m a fast learner.

I myself was rather on edge yesterday, because Evert had told me about the attack beforehand so that I could prepare a foolproof alibi for myself. It wasn’t easy. I had to hang about in the Conversation Lounge until finally a couple who live on my floor stood up to go upstairs."
B01K3WN90C2,B01K3WN90C,"She is forty-two years old and has been in charge for a year and a half now but is always on the lookout for an opportunity to kick or ass-kiss her way up the ladder, depending on whom she is dealing with. I’ve been watching her for a year or so.

I also have a most valuable informant: her secretary, Mrs. Appelboom. Anja Appelboom was the secretary of the last director, Mr. Lemaire, for twenty-three years, until the latest merger, when Lemaire was forced into early retirement. Anja has two years to go before she gets her pension, and since a new office manager was appointed over her head, she’s determined not to let Stelwagen get the better of her again. Anja still has access to all the meeting minutes and confidential documents. A few years ago she lived next door to me and saved me from the homeless shelter by arranging for me to come here. More on that some other day perhaps.

I often have a coffee with Anja in her office on Thursday mornings. That’s when Stelwagen and the office manager are off to their meeting with the unit managers and the district manager. Promotion to district manager is the next leap Stelwagen is hoping for.

Having coffee is a chance for us to gossip."
B01K3WN90C3,B01K3WN90C,"The people who used to live here have almost all traded their apartments for a modern row house in Purmerend or Almere. The only ones left are those who can’t afford to do so. Turkish, Moroccan, and West Indian families have moved into the vacated buildings. It makes for quite a jolly melting pot.

My range these days is about a quarter of a mile each way, with a pause on a bench at the halfway mark. I can’t manage much more than that. The world is shrinking. Starting from here, I can take one of four possible half-mile round trips.

Evert has just been to see me. He is getting enormous pleasure from the kerfuffle surrounding the fish massacre, and has a plan to turn it up a notch. He wants to mount a second offensive, this time with pink fondant petit fours. He thinks the color will have a more dramatic effect on the water. Yesterday he took the bus to a supermarket a few miles down the road especially to obtain a supply. If he had bought them here, in the home’s mini-market, they would be bound to remember his purchase. The cakes are now stashed in his cupboard. I asked if he thought they were safe there."
B01GYPY88Y0,B01GYPY88Y,"Then they put together a pitch, which usually involves Mark and Liz too, and someone from the digital team, and sometimes Adrian. He’s not just CEO but also the co-founder of Cooper Clemmow, and he has an office downstairs. (There was another co-founder, called Max, but he retired early to the south of France.)

Adrian’s quite amazing, actually. He’s about fifty and has a shock of iron-gray wavy hair and wears a lot of denim shirts and looks like he comes from the seventies. Which I suppose, in a way, he does. He’s also properly famous. Like, there’s a display of alumni outside King’s College, London, on the Strand, and Adrian’s picture is up there.

Anyway, so that’s all the main players. But I’m not at that level, nothing like. As I said, I’m involved in the research side, which means what I’m actually doing this week is…

And, listen, before I say it, it doesn’t sound glamorous, OK? But it’s not as bad as it sounds, really.

I’m inputting data. To be specific, the results of this big customer survey we did for Coffeewite about coffee, creamers, cappuccinos, and, well, everything. Two thousand handwritten surveys, each eight pages long. I know, right? Paper? No one does paper surveys anymore."
B01GYPY88Y1,B01GYPY88Y,"Dad doesn’t know anything about jobs, or London, or the economy, or, I don’t know, the price of a glass of wine in a London bar. I haven’t even told him exactly how much my rent is, because I know what he’d say; he’d say—

Oh God. Deep breath. Sorry. I didn’t mean to launch into some off-topic rant about my dad. Things haven’t been great between us, ever since I moved away after uni. He doesn’t understand why I moved here, and he never will. And I can try to explain it all I like, but if you can’t feel London, all you see are traffic and fumes and expense and your daughter choosing to move more than a hundred miles away.

I had a choice: Follow my heart or don’t break his. I think in the end I broke a bit of both our hearts. Which the rest of the world doesn’t understand, because they think it’s normal to move out and away from home. But they aren’t my dad and me, who lived together, just us, for all those years.

Anyway. Back to my work. People at my level don’t meet the clients—Demeter does that. And Rosa. They go out for the lunches and come back with pink cheeks and free samples and excitement."
B01GYPY88Y2,B01GYPY88Y,"What To Do When Your Loo Blocks And Your Dad Isn’t Answering The Phone And You’re About To Have A Party.)

It was in Birmingham that I decided to lose my West Country accent. I was in the loo, minding my own business, when I heard a couple of girls taking the piss out of me. Farrrmer Katie, they were calling me. And, yes, I was shocked, and, yes, it stung. I could have burst out of my cubicle and exclaimed, Well, I don’t think your Brummie accent’s any better!

But I didn’t. I just sat there and thought hard. It was a reality check. By the time I got my second internship—the one in east London — I was a different person. I’d wised up. I didn’t look or sound like Katie Brenner from Ansters Farm.

And now I’m totally Cat Brenner from London. Cat Brenner who works in a cool office with distressed-brick walls and white shiny desks and funky chairs and a coat stand in the shape of a naked man. (It gives everyone a real shock, the first time they come to visit.)

I mean, I am Cat. I will be. I just have to nail the not-signing-the-wrong-name thing."
B01GYPY88Y3,B01GYPY88Y,"But I live in a top-ten city. Living in London is something that people all over the world would love to do, and now I’m here. And that’s why I don’t care if my commute is the journey from hell and I don’t care if my bedroom is about three foot square. I’m here.

I couldn’t get here straightaway. The only offer I had after uni was in a tiny marketing firm in Birmingham. So I moved up there and immediately started creating a new personality. I had bangs cut. I started straightening my hair every day and putting it in a smart knot. I bought myself a pair of black glasses with clear lenses. I looked different. I felt different. I even started doing my makeup differently, with super-defined lip liner every day and black liquid eyeliner in flicky curves.

(It took me a whole weekend to learn how to do that flicky eyeliner. It’s an actual skill, like trigonometry —so what I wonder is, why don’t they teach that at school? If I ran the country there’d be courses in things that you’d actually use your whole life. Like: How To Do Eyeliner. How To Fill In A Tax Return."
B01FRSZAUO0,B01FRSZAUO,"Perhaps Jakob will propose when the talk of war has subsided. Or maybe he’s waiting until he’s saved enough to afford his own place. Bella lives with her parents, too—just a few blocks west on Witolda Boulevard. Whatever the case, Nechuma has no doubt that Jakob has a plan.

At the head of the table, Sol breaks a piece of matzah gently in two. He sets one half of the matzah on a plate and wraps the other in a napkin. When the children were younger, Sol would spend weeks plotting the perfect hiding spot for the matzah, and when the time came in the ceremony to unearth the hidden afikomen, the kids would scamper like mice through the apartment in search of it. Whoever was lucky enough to find it would barter ruthlessly until inevitably walking away with a proud smile and enough zloty in his or her palm to purchase a sack of fudge krówki at Pomianowski’s candy store. Sol was a businessman and played hard— the King Negotiator, they called him—but his children knew well that deep down he was as soft as a mound of freshly churned butter, and that with enough patience and charm, they could milk him for every zloty in his pocket."
B01FRSZAUO1,B01FRSZAUO,", when she held him in her arms and looked into his inky eyes, he’d stared up at her, the skin over his brow creased with a small fold, as if he were deep in thought. It was then that she understood who he was. Quiet, yes, but astute. Like his brothers and sisters born before and after him, a tiny version of the person he would grow up to be.

She watches as Jakob leans to whisper something in Bella’s ear. Bella brings a napkin to her lips, stifling a smile. On her collar, a pin catches the candlelight—a gold rose-shaped brooch with an ivory pearl at its center, a gift from Jakob. He’d given it to her a few months after they met at gymnasium. He was fifteen at the time, she fourteen. Back then, all Nechuma knew of Bella was that she took her studies seriously, that she came from a family of modest means (according to Jakob, her father, a dentist , was still settling the loans he’d taken on to pay for his daughters’ education), and that she sewed many of her own clothes, a revelation that impressed Nechuma and prompted her to wonder which of Bella’s smartest blouses were store-bought and which were handmade. It was shortly after Jakob gave Bella the brooch that he declared her his soulmate."
B01FRSZAUO2,B01FRSZAUO,"Pinching her shoulder blades down her back, she feels the weight of her bosom lift from her ribs. It’s not like her to be so inundated with worry, so distracted. Pull yourself together, she chides. The family will be fine, she reminds herself. They have a healthy savings. They have connections. Addy will turn up. The mail has been unreliable; in all likelihood, a letter explaining his absence will arrive any day. It will all be fine.

As Sol recites the blessing of the karpas, Nechuma dips a sprig of parsley into a bowl of salt water and her hand brushes Jakob’s. She sighs, feeling the tension begin to drain from her jaw. Sweet Jakob. He catches her eye and smiles, and Nechuma’s heart fills with gratitude for the fact that he is still living under her roof. She adores his company, his calm. He’s different from the others. Unlike his siblings, who entered the world red-faced and wailing, Jakob arrived as white as her hospital bedsheets and silent, as if mimicking the giant snowflakes falling peacefully to the earth outside her window on that wintery February morning, twenty-three years ago. Nechuma would never forget the harrowing moments before he finally cried— she was sure at the time that he wouldn’t survive the day —or how"
B01FRSZAUO3,B01FRSZAUO,"Their fabric shop is thriving; Nechuma takes great care on her buying trips to collect the highest-quality textiles, and their clients, both Polish and Jewish, come from as far as Kraków to purchase their ladieswear and silk. When their children were of school age, Sol and Nechuma sent them to elite private academies, where, thanks to their tailored shirts and perfect Polish, they fit in seamlessly with the majority of the students, who were Catholic. In addition to providing them with the best possible education, Sol and Nechuma hoped to give their children a chance to sidestep the undertones of anti-Semitism that had defined Jewish life in Radom since before any of them could remember. Though the family was proudly rooted in its Jewish heritage and very much a part of the local Jewish community, for her children Nechuma chose a path she hoped would steer them toward opportunity—and away from persecution. It is a path she stands by, even when now and then at the synagogue, or while shopping at one of the Jewish bakeries in the Old Quarter, she catches one of Radom’s more orthodox Jews glancing at her with a look of disapproval—as if her decision to mix with the Poles has somehow diminished her faith as a Jew. She refuses to be bothered by these encounters. She knows her faith—and besides, religion, to Nechuma, is a private matter."
B00ATNJW3Y0,B00ATNJW3Y,"Nothing has changed.

The two-story white house with the red door is the same. No cars in the driveway, lawn manicured to perfection. My room is dark and I wonder what they did with it. Are my pictures still lining the hallway or did those come down when I betrayed them in the worst way? What will they say when their defiant son knocks on the door and wants to stay for dinner?

I drive two blocks down and one over and stop in front of the Preston house. I’m not a fool to think she still lives here, but I know she wouldn’t miss this unless she and Katelyn are no longer friends.

The porch light flips on and the door opens. Mr. Preston, the man who was to be my father-in-law, steps out onto the porch. I know he can’t see me through my darkened helmet, but maybe he’s wondering.

He stands there and stares at me and I at him. He’s aged, just like I’m assuming my father has. He steps down onto the grass and that’s my cue to go. I hit the throttle and take off down the street, leaving Mr. Preston in his yard wondering."
B00ATNJW3Y1,B00ATNJW3Y,"Nothing is the same and everything could’ve been just like it was planned out. Mason’s not supposed to be gone. If anything, it should be me. I screwed up the plan.

I step back into the room, closing the door and pulling the curtains closed. When I look at the bed, it’s mocking me, telling me I’m uninvited. It doesn’t want me any more than I want it.

I can’t stay here. This room is going to suffocate me. I get rid of my disguise and grab my jacket and helmet. Maybe riding will clear my head, but then again, maybe not. The last time I went on an unplanned road trip I made a life-altering decision.

The red exit sign above the staircase is more inviting than the elevator. I slam my shoulder into the door and rush down the stairs, sliding down the railing just like I did when I was younger, something I haven’t done in a long time.

My helmet is on before I reach the lobby. The last thing I want is the receptionist tart getting any ideas about who I am. My luck, she’d let herself into my room, lie on the bug infested bedspread and wait for me to claim her.

I’ll pass."
B00ATNJW3Y2,B00ATNJW3Y,"When I step in, I look at the card and sigh. I’m on the sixth floor, the highest one they have, but not high enough for me. This will have to do and it’s only short term. I’m just here to say goodbye to Mason and stare at her for a bit before returning to my life.

The hallway reeks. That is the first thing I notice when I step out of the elevator. That and the ugly ass carpet lining the halls. I despise the smell of stale smoke. I push into my room, dropping my bag onto one of the double beds. I walk over to the sliding glass door, throw open the thick dark curtains and stare out at the lights of Beaumont. I flick the latch and open the door, stepping out into the chilled air.

The sound of breaking glass causes me to look left. Immediately, I wish I hadn’t because just off in the distance is the water tower Mason and I, along with a few others, used to climb after our games. We’d take a case of beer up there, leave the girls down at the bottom and see who could hit the bed of my truck with their empty bottles."
B00ATNJW3Y3,B00ATNJW3Y,"How many kids does she have and what does her husband do for a living? I only hope he treats her better than I ever did because she deserves it and so much more.

Pulling into the Holiday Inn just outside of Beaumont, I shut off my bike before the manager comes out to tell me I’m disturbing the peace. With the kickstand down and my helmet off, I slip on a pair of fake eyeglasses and pull a baseball cap down low. I know word will spread once I step foot into Beaumont, but for a few days I’d like to be anonymous. I slide my arms into my weather proof guitar case and unhook my bag from the back of my bike.

The walk to the lobby is painstakingly long. This hotel isn’t far off the highway and the noise is very present. This is the most unassuming hotel and one where people wouldn’t think to look for me. I remember when I told Sam to book my room here; I thought I killed her with just the words of a three star Notel Motel. Yet here I am walking into a commoner lobby with the TV blaring and stale coffee sitting in the pot next to this morning’s donuts."
B01MTJQFQY0,B01MTJQFQY,"He would unlock the gate and slide it open with his toe. His holster was empty. No gun. Standard practice everywhere in the world. No prison guard was ever armed. To carry a loaded weapon among locked-up prisoners would be just asking for trouble. He would step into the cell. He would hook his keys back on his belt and juggle the tray back into two hands. He would turn away, toward the concrete desk.

Which relative positioning would offer a number of different opportunities.

Reacher waited.

But no.

The kid was the kind of rookie who got his car stolen, but he wasn’t totally dumb. He put the tray on the floor outside the cell, just temporarily, and he took the coffee pot off it, and the cup and saucer, and he placed them all on the tile on the wrong side of the bars, and then he picked up the tray again and fed it through the slot. Reacher took it. To get a drink, he would have to put his wrists between the bars and pour on the outside. The cup would fit back through. Maybe not on its saucer, but then, he wasn’t dining at the Ritz."
B01MTJQFQY1,B01MTJQFQY,"Then eventually the young cop came back with the food. His last duty of the day, almost certainly. He was carrying a tray with a china plate with a metal cover, and a white fluted fat-bellied plastic coffee flask, and a saucer topped with an upside-down cup, and a knife and a fork wrapped in a paper napkin.

The plastic flask was the key component. It made the whole assemblage too tall to fit through the horizontal pass-through slot in the bars. The kid couldn’t lay the flask down on its side on the tray. It would roll around and the coffee would spill out all over the pie. He couldn’t pass it upright on its own through a regular part of the bars, because they were too close together for its fat-bellied shape.

The kid paused, unsure.

Twenty-four years old. A rookie. A guy who knew Reacher as nothing worse than a placid old man who spent all his time on his bed, apparently relaxed and resigned. No shouting, no yelling. No complaints. No bad temper.

Trusting the system.

No danger.

He would balance the tray one-handed on steepled fingers, like a regular waiter. He would take his keys off his belt."
B01MTJQFQY2,B01MTJQFQY,"Then she said something else, lawyer-like and quietly, about client confidentiality, and the guy got up and left the room. He closed the steel door behind him. The cell block went quiet. The lawyer looked in the bars at Reacher. Like a person at the zoo. Maybe at the gorilla house. She was medium height and medium weight, and she was wearing a black skirt suit. She had short brown hair with lighter streaks, and brown eyes, and a round face, with a downturned mouth. Like an upside-down smile. As if she had suffered many disappointments in her life. She was carrying a leather briefcase too fat to zip. There was a yellow legal pad poking out the top. It was covered with handwritten notes.

She left the briefcase on the floor and went back and dragged the stool out from behind the booking table. She positioned it outside Reacher’s cage and climbed up on it, and got comfortable, with her knees pressed tight together, and the heels of her shoes hooked over the rail. Like a regular client meeting, one person either side of a desk or a table, except there was no desk or table. Just a wall of thick steel bars, closely spaced."
B01MTJQFQY3,B01MTJQFQY,"The cops looked in for a second more, like people at the zoo, and then they about-turned and walked back past the booking table and out of the room, one after the other. Reacher heard the steel door close after the last of them. He heard it lock.

He waited. He was good at waiting. He was a patient man. He had nowhere to go, and all the time in the world to get there. He sat on the bed, which was a cast concrete structure, as was a little desk, with an integral stool. The stool had a little round pad, made of the same thin vinyl-covered foam as the mattress on the bed. The toilet was steel, with a dished-in top to act as a basin. Cold water only. Like the world’s lousiest motel room, further stripped back to the unavoidable minimum requirements, and then reduced in size to the barely bearable. The old-time architects had used even more concrete than elsewhere. As if prisoners trying to escape might exert more force than atom bombs.

—

Reacher kept track of time in his head. Two hours ticked by, and part of a third, and then the youngest of the county uniforms came by for a status check."
B004L62E080,B004L62E08,"Fire like fear, like panic, like one more minute of this and I’ll die if he doesn’t knock at my door, but I’d sooner he never knock than knock now. I had learned to leave my French windows ajar, and I’d lie on my bed wearing only my bathing suit, my entire body on fire. Fire like a pleading that says, Please, please, tell me I’m wrong, tell me I’ve imagined all this, because it can’t possibly be true for you as well, and if it’s true for you too, then you’re the cruelest man alive. This, the afternoon he did finally walk into my room without knocking as if summoned by my prayers and asked how come I wasn’t with the others at the beach, and all I could think of saying, though I couldn’t bring myself to say it, was, To be with you. To be with you, Oliver. With or without my bathing suit. To be with you on my bed. In your bed. Which is my bed during the other months of the year. Do with me what you want. Take me. Just ask if I want to and see the answer you’ll get, just don’t let me say no."
B004L62E081,B004L62E08,"Why won’t I believe it tomorrow morning?

So this is who he also is, I said to myself after seeing how he’d flipped from ice to sunshine.

I might as well have asked: Do I flip back and forth in just the same way?

P.S. We are not written for one instrument alone; I am not, neither are you.

I had been perfectly willing to brand him as difficult and unapproachable and have nothing more to do with him. Two words from him, and I had seen my pouting apathy change into I’ll play anything for you till you ask me to stop, till it’s time for lunch, till the skin on my fingers wears off layer after layer, because I like doing things for you, will do anything for you, just say the word, I liked you from day one, and even when you’ll return ice for my renewed offers of friendship, I’ll never forget that this conversation occurred between us and that there are easy ways to bring back summer in the snowstorm.

What I forgot to earmark in that promise was that ice and apathy have ways of instantly repealing all truces and resolutions signed in sunnier moments."
B004L62E082,B004L62E08,"I’d grown up with and known every year of my life until then but that had suddenly turned on me and acquired an inflection forever colored by the events of that summer.

Or perhaps it started after his first week, when I was thrilled to see he still remembered who I was, that he didn’t ignore me, and that, therefore, I could allow myself the luxury of passing him on my way to the garden and not having to pretend I was unaware of him. We jogged early on the first morning—all the way up to B. and back. Early the next morning we swam. Then, the day after, we jogged again. I liked racing by the milk delivery van when it was far from done with its rounds, or by the grocer and the baker as they were just getting ready for business, liked to run along the shore and the promenade when there wasn’t a soul about yet and our house seemed a distant mirage. I liked it when our feet were aligned, left with left, and struck the ground at the same time, leaving footprints on the shore that I wished to return to and, in secret, place my foot where his had left its mark."
B004L62E083,B004L62E08,"I must have shot him a similarly wicked glance.

For two days our conversations came to a sudden halt.

On the long balcony that both our bedrooms shared, total avoidance: just a makeshift hello, good morning, nice weather, shallow chitchat.

Then, without explanation, things resumed.

Did I want to go jogging this morning? No, not really. Well, let’s swim, then.

Today, the pain, the stoking, the thrill of someone new, the promise of so much bliss hovering a fingertip away, the fumbling around people I might misread and don’t want to lose and must second-guess at every turn, the desperate cunning I bring to everyone I want and crave to be wanted by, the screens I put up as though between me and the world there were not just one but layers of rice-paper sliding doors, the urge to scramble and unscramble what was never really coded in the first place— all these started the summer Oliver came into our house. They are embossed on every song that was a hit that summer, in every novel I read during and after his stay, on anything from the smell of rosemary on hot days to the frantic rattle of the cicadas in the afternoon—smells and sounds"
B00BSBR9N60,B00BSBR9N6,"Although she was a mathematics teacher, she had little interest in advances in the field. However, she lived nearby and would visit twice weekly and sometimes randomly. We would eat together and discuss trivia, such as events in the lives of our relatives and social interactions with our colleagues. Once a month, we drove to Shepparton for Sunday dinner with our parents and brother. She was single, probably as a result of being shy and not conventionally attractive. Due to gross and inexcusable medical incompetence, she is now dead.

The second friend was Daphne, whose friendship period also overlapped with Gene and Claudia’s. She moved into the apartment above mine after her husband entered a nursing home as a result of dementia. Due to knee failure, exacerbated by obesity, she was unable to walk more than a few steps, but she was highly intelligent and I began to visit her regularly. She had no formal qualifications, having performed a traditional female homemaker role. I considered this to be an extreme waste of talent—particularly as her descendants did not return the care. She was curious about my work, and we initiated the Teach Daphne Genetics Project, which was fascinating for both of us."
B00BSBR9N61,B00BSBR9N6,"I had no previous knowledge of autism spectrum disorders, as they were outside my specialty. The subject was fascinating. It seemed appropriate to focus on the genetic aspects of the syndrome, which might be unfamiliar to my audience. Most diseases have some basis in our DNA, though in many cases we have yet to discover it. My own work focuses on genetic predisposition to cirrhosis of the liver. Much of my working time is devoted to getting mice drunk.

Naturally, the books and research papers described the symptoms of Asperger’s syndrome, and I formed a provisional conclusion that most of these were simply variations in human brain function that had been inappropriately medicalized because they did not fit social norms—constructed social norms—that reflected the most common human configurations rather than the full range.

The lecture was scheduled for 7:00 p.m. at an inner-suburban school. I estimated the cycle ride at twelve minutes and allowed three minutes to boot my computer and connect it to the projector.

I arrived on schedule at 6:57 p.m., having let Eva, the short-skirted cleaner, into my apartment twenty-seven minutes earlier. There were approximately twenty-five people milling around the door and the front of the classroom, but I immediately recognized Julie, the convenor, from Gene’s description:"
B00BSBR9N62,B00BSBR9N6,"Unfortunately, their approach was based on the traditional dating paradigm, which I had previously abandoned on the basis that the probability of success did not justify the effort and negative experiences. I am thirty-nine years old, tall, fit, and intelligent, with a relatively high status and above-average income as an associate professor. Logically, I should be attractive to a wide range of women. In the animal kingdom, I would succeed in reproducing.

However, there is something about me that women find unappealing. I have never found it easy to make friends, and it seems that the deficiencies that caused this problem have also affected my attempts at romantic relationships. The Apricot Ice Cream Disaster is a good example.

Claudia had introduced me to one of her many friends. Elizabeth was a highly intelligent computer scientist, with a vision problem that had been corrected with glasses. I mention the glasses because Claudia showed me a photograph and asked me if I was okay with them. An incredible question! From a psychologist! In evaluating Elizabeth’s suitability as a potential partner—someone to provide intellectual stimulation, to share activities with, perhaps even to breed with—Claudia’s first concern was my reaction to her choice of glasses frames, which was probably not even her own but the result of advice from an optometrist. This is the world I have to live in."
B00BSBR9N63,B00BSBR9N6,"Eva would enjoy having her competence recognized and might even be suitable for a permanent role, which would free up an average of 316 minutes per week in my schedule.

Gene’s lecture problem had arisen because he had an opportunity to have sex with a Chilean academic who was visiting Melbourne for a conference. Gene has a project to have sex with women of as many different nationalities as possible. As a professor of psychology, he is extremely interested in human sexual attraction, which he believes is largely genetically determined.

This belief is consistent with Gene’s background as a geneticist. Sixty-eight days after Gene hired me as a postdoctoral researcher, he was promoted to head of the Psychology Department, a highly controversial appointment that was intended to establish the university as the Australian leader in evolutionary psychology and increase its public profile.

During the time we worked concurrently in the Genetics Department, we had numerous interesting discussions, and these continued after his change of position. I would have been satisfied with our relationship for this reason alone, but Gene also invited me to dinner at his house and performed other friendship rituals, resulting in a social relationship. His wife, Claudia, who is a clinical psychologist, is now also a friend. Making a total of two.

Gene and Claudia tried for a while to assist me with the Wife Problem."
B079FS38PW0,B079FS38PW,"It’s not that there’s anything wrong with them, you understand, little lamb, he’d say when I’d ask him a question after reading some new book or watching a movie in which the unsparked lived their magic-free lives. They’re just different. They’ve never understood what we are, and they never will. So it’s best we don’t mingle any more than we need to.

I wasn’t sure exactly what he’d have been worried would happen to me in town on my own at thirteen. It wasn’t as if anyone was burning suspected witches these days. But it didn’t matter now. I’d been going around Portland without any company for the last few years, once Dad’s and Celestine’s nerves had settled about my interest in keeping unsparked company. It would have been ridiculous to go back to those old rules now, when I was twenty-four.

Phil and I passed a couple of farm houses and then came into the town proper. A few cars puttered down the otherwise quiet roads. The downtown area was made up of a central cobblestone square with a large fountain in the middle and a couple streets on each side with their hodgepodge of shops.

Looking around, I realized with a twinge that I couldn’t actually say how much had changed. My visits here as a kid had been infrequent as well as escorted. My whole life had revolved around the estate."
B079FS38PW1,B079FS38PW,"When he saw me coming down, he smiled.

There was absolutely nothing wrong with Derek Conwyn, really. He had a softly handsome face with a high brow and light brown eyes that glimmered when a subject caught his interest. Looking at him from above as I descended the stairs, I had an excellent view of his broad shoulders and defined chest. He’d come up from Louisiana, where his family was based, so when he spoke it was with an appealing drawl. I couldn’t complain about any of that.

The only problem was I didn’t know him all that well yet. He was from a witching family, he was willing to marry into mine, he liked jazz music and sailing and dropping bad puns when a group conversation got a little tense. The rest would come now that we had more time to spend together without so much company looking on. At least, I hoped it would.

I didn’t really have a whole lot of choice. If I hadn’t taken a consort by the time I turned twenty-five, the spark of my magic would snuff out forever. Maybe I wasn’t madly in love with Derek, but he was the best out of the witching guys I’d met."
B079FS38PW2,B079FS38PW,"I leaned forward into a streak of morning sunlight. The room’s only natural illumination drifted down from a few skylights on the high ceiling. No risk of any curious eyes peeking inside. Just me and the dust motes dancing with me in the air, surrounded by the wood panel walls and the lingering scent of jasmine incense.

Books were my happy place, but now that I could practice the witching forms without a tutor looking over my shoulder, this place was pretty happy too. As I moved through the shapes and stretches, my mind drifted back to all the childhood stories I’d read about great feats of magical power. Raising bridges out of the earth to cross a frothing river. Calling a rainstorm to soothe parched fields and end a drought. Casting a shield to fend off an entire army.

Not likely I was ever going to need to do anything like that, but that didn’t make daydreaming any less fun.

I finished the last in the standard forms set and took a few minutes to cool down. Then I headed down the hall to my bedroom to change. Done properly, the forms could work up a bit of a sweat."
B079FS38PW3,B079FS38PW,"The handsome part, well…

Kyler Lennox had grown up a lot from the 14-year-old boy he’d been when we’d last roamed the estate grounds together. In both inches and presence. Now that he was standing straight, he had at least half a foot in height on me, and I wasn’t exactly petite at five foot seven. His eyes shone with the cheerful energy I remembered, but there was a little more gravity to his gaze than there’d once been.

He ran a hand through his tawny hair, looking sheepish and excited at the same time. My gaze couldn’t help following the way his arm flexed against his fitted button-down. He might have been slim, but he was clearly not a weakling.

And now that he was here, as if he’d stepped straight out of the past into my bedroom , I had no idea what to say. I crossed my arms over the chest of my kiddy pajamas. My pulse was racing.

This was what I’d wanted, wasn’t it? To bring my old friends, the boys I’d spent so many hours with all those years ago, back to me somehow? But I hadn’t expected them to come quite so fast."
B07B8JSRVL0,B07B8JSRVL,"It’s almost eight o’clock and way too early for me to go to bed, but I have a good mystery book calling my name and a balcony waiting to be sat in. Sounds like a perfect night to me.

I make my way to the resort and cut through one of the pool areas. The resort has three pools, but this is the biggest one with its cascading sides, cement fish spouting water in the air, and poolside bar. The lights are dim, the water of the pool reflecting a bright teal glow, and faint music plays in the background. Everyone must be out to dinner, or down at the bars, which is so not my scene.

Closing the gate behind me, I nod at the bartender as I make my way through the pool area only to see a woman sitting at the end of the bar by herself, casually stirring a drink, legs crossed, long ebony, wavy hair lusciously falling over her shoulder.

I know that hair.

I know those slight shoulders, the smooth, freshly showered skin.

Pausing in my path to my room, I also recognize those perfects tits, small but also full. Before I can stop myself, I’m walking toward her, a bit of pep in my step and a need to know more about her."
B07B8JSRVL1,B07B8JSRVL,"Hopefully Mr. Wilder doesn’t mind me using one of his towels or his room for that matter. He’s probably some old dude away on his golfing vacation. I hope I don’t give him a heart attack.

I drape my towel over the bed and run my hands through my naturally wavy, black hair. This will have to do. Picking up my towel one more time, I scrunch my hair, trying to soak up all the water just as the hotel door swings open, light blaring through, a tall, dark silhouette shadowed in the doorframe.

I still, frozen from the tips of my toes to the hand scrunching a towel in my hair.

Toned calves and legs are covered by black board shorts, slick to his thighs, a bulge prominent. Narrow waist where his board shorts ride low on his hips, a black shirt dancing across his broad chest, cinching sleeves cuffed over his biceps, and a V-neck providing a glimpse of how far his tan extends. Head cast down, eyes transfixed on his phone in front of him, he doesn’t notice the naked girl standing in the middle of his hotel room. He stuffs his keycard in his back pocket and looks up, startled.

I scream.

He grumbles something unintelligible as I point out the obvious."
B07B8JSRVL2,B07B8JSRVL,"Crystal-blue ocean shines below me, and if I wasn’t so scared of Zoey and her repercussions for being late, I would take the time to appreciate Mother Nature. Instead I hurry into my room, flop my suitcase on my bed, unzip it, and grab my toiletries.

Not taking a second longer, I strip down, leaving my gross airplane clothes on the floor, and practically skip to the shower where I stop mid stride.

In the shower stall is a black razor, with accompanying shaving cream. That’s odd. Is that courtesy of the hotel? This place is fancy, but not that fancy. Spinning on my heel, I turn toward the sink behind me and spot a white and green toothbrush, tube of toothpaste, and men’s cologne. Shit, turning toward the room, my eyes frantically roam the space, spotting a black suitcase in the corner.

Shit, shit, shit.

Naked, I cover my breasts with my arm and open the closet door only to come face to face with a few hung-up shirts.

Yup . . . I’m in someone else’s fucking room.

And whoever this room belongs to is the neatest person ever because who honestly lines up their toothbrush and toothpaste tube perfectly on the counter?

Reaching for the phone, I call down to the front desk."
B07B8JSRVL3,B07B8JSRVL,"From the front seat, I can faintly hear Victoria recount the flight, reflecting on her recent read about Amelia Earhart and the suspicions that she possibly didn’t die in a plane crash but was captured by island natives. Semi-fascinated in the conversation, but bitter from my flight, I tune them out and hold on to the cart and my luggage as we drive along the coast of Key West, passing by palm trees, diving pelicans, and random roosters standing by the side of the road.

Odd.

Taking a deep breath, I soak in the sea salt air and feel the sun blazing on my exposed skin. This is supposed to be an adventure, a time to relax, an opportunity to spark the writing bug, to light that little fucker’s ass on fire.

Instead of focusing on the bad, like the inappropriate diddle in security, or the regurgitated mango and peach combination plastered on my neck, I need to look forward to the next week here. This is going to be fun . . . it has to be.

It doesn’t take long for Zoey to drop us at the hotel lobby where she parks the golf cart, tips a bell hop, and walks us into check-in."
B01B5FMBQO0,B01B5FMBQO,"Since Frisha desired to go along, Tam, Jimson, and his soldiers were obliged to go as well. Not to be left out, Reaylin demanded a place among them.

Captain Jimson procured horses for the group at the general’s expense. Frisha insisted on taking a picnic, which was not a bad idea considering they intended to be gone for several hours. Rezkin was relieved that the nobles had little interest in traipsing through the forest and desired nothing more than to luxuriate in the comfort of a hot bath and a few bottles of wine at the inn.

Rezkin found himself watching Frisha as she strolled up to her assigned mount. She wore a beige tunic with brown pants. Her corset-like knife belt accentuated her narrow waist and emphasized her womanly curves. Rezkin realized he was not evaluating the length or consistency of her gait or the manner in which her weight fell on her feet. For a brief moment, his assessing mind was quiet as he silently appreciated the soft sway of her hips. Rezkin shook his head to clear his thoughts. Somehow, Shiela’s overbearing attempts at seduction had only succeeded in highlighting Frisha’s less contrived, natural femininity. Unlike with Shiela, Rezkin did not feel inclined to decapitate someone every time Frisha was present."
B01B5FMBQO1,B01B5FMBQO,"Rezkin truly was a master manipulator of the truth.

After nearly a week, the ship’s captain announced that they would be stopping over in the riverside town of Teurning. Teurning was a logging town of moderate size in the Barony of Fendendril that most people simply called Fenden. The baron and his son were also traveling to the tournament and would be boarding the ship. The weather, so far, had been ideal, and despite the earlier mishap, the ship was more than a day ahead of schedule. The crew would be able to make necessary repairs, and it was the perfect opportunity for some much-desired time ashore for the passengers.

Pride was especially grateful for the respite from his confinement aboard the ship. He was restless during the best of times, and he was becoming positively unruly during the riparian journey. Rezkin decided to take the stallion for a run along the forest road. When he mentioned his plans to the ship’s captain, one of the deck hands overheard. The man, originally from the town, indicated the location of a scenic spot, complete with waterfall and crystal pool, which he should take in along the way. Hearing this, Frisha decided she needed to see the place."
B01B5FMBQO2,B01B5FMBQO,"Malcius and Palis had also been developing their friendships with Tieran, and he had enough empathy for their brotherly plight that he at least tried to look the other way when Shiela behaved shamelessly. Her shame was contained while they were sequestered on the ship. It was only a matter of time before they returned to high society, and then Malcius would have to endure the full brunt of the rumors, and there would be rumors. These kinds of things had a way of spreading, like a plague. His father would be furious when he heard.

The count was conveniently oblivious to his daughter’s usual coquettish behavior. He saw his dear, sweet daughter as an angel without vice, and everyone was simply too afraid to disillusion the powerful man. The Jebai heir was almost certain Rezkin would say nothing, at least for now, while he pursued Frisha. Tieran, however, had the clout to be heard, even by the count. If Tieran made the accusations, Malcius’s father could not afford to dismiss the claims.

On the fourth day, Malcius, Palis, Tieran, Brandt and Reaylin were on the quarterdeck practicing for the tournament when there was a sudden shout followed by a loud ripping and whizzing sound that abruptly stopped with a thunk. The young men and woman were looking all around for the source of the noise when another unexpectedly loud snap sounded."
B01B5FMBQO3,B01B5FMBQO,"The journey was going to be a long one for Malcius. As the future leader of his house, he was responsible for upholding the family name. Developing a friendship with Rezkin, as his father had ordered, came naturally, and he was grateful for it. He reviled the times he had to get close to someone he hated just for the sake of some power play. Malcius actually liked Rezkin, though.

Rezkin exuded an aura of power and confidence wrapped in a shell of courtly grace and propriety. He was congenial and diplomatic and one of the most approachable men Malcius had ever met. At the same time, Rezkin possessed a dominance that Malcius would normally find off-putting. Malcius could not help but admire and respect the man. He felt the desire to prove himself to the lord in a way he would not have expected. Somehow, he felt that if he had Rezkin’s approval, then he would be the kind of man his father expected him to be, or perhaps better, better even than his father. And, that was an odd concept he had never before considered.

Shiela’s constant attempts at pandering were grating, though. For the most part, Rezkin shrugged them off with grace."
B01H9DSUAW0,B01H9DSUAW,"So, even though this one had room for 640 occupants, it didn’t have all the amenities of a prison. There was no library, or gymnasium, or even a contact visitation room. I had to use a handset to speak to my visitors through the thick plexiglass window that separated us.

Not that I had many visitors.

Other than Casey, my only visitor had been Sergeant Dix, a Special Forces master sergeant. My CIA recruiter had enlisted Dix as part of the training program he’d designed to bring me up to par with the SOG’s other recruits, most of whom hailed from elite military units. Dix and I had grown close over the course of a very intense year, and had kept in touch the way guys tend to do, which is to say very occasionally, or whenever it was important.

I didn’t know Casey nearly as well as I knew Dix. My first battle beside him was still a couple of weeks away. But even without that familiarity, I could tell from the look in his bright eyes that the news wasn’t going to be good.

Casey picked up his handset, and I picked up my handset, and he launched right into it."
B01H9DSUAW1,B01H9DSUAW,"While Casey’s investigators were out looking for an alternative man and motive to wave before my jury, I was keeping to myself and getting into the best climbing shape of my life. 860, 861, 862.

I was also exercising my brain in a way I’d never done before. In Moonwalking with Einstein, I’d read that a person could win the US Memory Championship by practicing an hour a day for a year. Sounded pretty cool to me — not to mention therapeutic. I’d found that I could force myself to block out virtually any amount of physical or emotional pain if focused on a compelling goal.

While I wasn’t planning on being in jail for a whole year, I could easily dedicate an hour a day to each of the competition’s categories. After six months, I was up to 49 random words and 147 random digits. I was also getting competitive with memorizing decks of cards, my favorite.

At the moment however, I was focused on my physical routine — and my new neighbor. NFL was about as close to Miss Manners as they came in this place. 888, 889, 890. Since the endorphins were flowing and the inverted sit-ups were just the beginning of my routine, I answered his question."
B01H9DSUAW2,B01H9DSUAW,"I couldn’t let that happen.

Not now.

Not until Frost believed in my innocence.

Chapter 7

Four Bags

TO RETURN REASON to the driver’s seat, I had to relegate emotion to the back. To accomplish this, I did as I was trained. I painted my grief as a big gray blanket on the canvas of my mind, heavy and coarse and damp with tears. I folded it in half and half again until it was a manageable size. Then, reverently and temporarily, I set it aside.

Sometime later I heard the lock click. The door opened, and a very different detective walked in. She was ship-shape and petite and a good ten years younger than Frost. A huge and pleasant contrast.

The first thought to cross my refocused mind was that she too had to be either pretty darn good or well connected to get a plum detective job with her demographic profile. My second thought was that she hadn’t brought me coffee either. Rather she was carrying a black backpack by the top handle as though it were a briefcase. She set it down on the floor and came around the table to introduce herself with an extended hand and a courteous smile."
B01H9DSUAW3,B01H9DSUAW,"I was expecting some kind of CIA inquiry or debriefing, having just resurfaced back in the US for the first time since resigning a year earlier. But Langley wouldn’t involve a police detective. They’d videoconference or send a local agent.

My empty stomach twitched a warning.

I looked at my watch: 10:49 a.m. My family would be polishing off their mimosas right about now at whatever local gem had earned the best Sunday brunch reviews. I had until 1:00 p.m. to get back to the Emerging Sea if we were going to stick to the schedule. Dad was big on schedules, as was Colin. Martha and Katya seemed considerably more relaxed, although I was still getting to know them.

I started to pull out my phone to call my dad, but remembered that my cell’s battery had died without the usual overnight recharge. I was debating pounding on the door and asking for a phone when it opened and a mid-fifties bureaucrat walked in. He had more hair sprouting from his ears than above them, like a continuation of his mustache, and his paunch was bigger than a bag of bagels. To be working here looking like that, this guy had to be either very good or well-connected."
B01KGZVTOE0,B01KGZVTOE,"It’s not like I’d be breaking any rules, but it’s no one else’s business, and I wouldn’t want to have to explain to Bob how I’d been working weekends and yet still hadn’t managed to make a dent in the huge pile of invoices waiting to be processed. Plus, I could do other things at home at the same time, like cook a trial menu for our first dinner together. Mummy told me, years ago, that men go absolutely crazy for sausage rolls. The way to a man’s heart, she said, is a homemade sausage roll, hot, flaky pastry, good quality meat. I haven’t cooked anything except pasta for years. I’ve never made a sausage roll. I don’t suppose it’s terribly difficult, though. It’s only pastry and mechanically recovered meat.

I switched on the machine and entered my password, but the whole screen froze. I turned the computer off and on again, and this time it didn’t even get as far as the password prompt. Annoying. I went to see Loretta, the office manager. She has overinflated ideas of her own administrative abilities, and in her spare time makes hideous jewelry, which she then sells to idiots. I told her my computer wasn’t working, and that I hadn’t been able to get hold of Danny in IT."
B01KGZVTOE1,B01KGZVTOE,"I had been drinking sour white wine, warm and tainted by the plastic glasses the pub made us drink from. What savages they must think us! Billy had insisted on buying it, to thank me for inviting him. There was no question of it being a date. The very notion was ridiculous.

The lights went down. Billy hadn’t wanted to watch the other acts, but I was adamant. You never know if you’ll be bearing witness as a new star emerges, never know who’s going to walk onto the stage and set it alight. And then he did. I stared at him. He was light and heat. He blazed. Everything he came into contact with would be changed. I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. I’d found him.

Now that fate had unfurled my future, I simply had to find out more about him; the singer, the answer. Before I tackled the horror that was the month-end accounts, I thought I’d have a quick look at a few sites—Argos, John Lewis —to see how much a computer would cost. I suppose I could have come into the office during the weekend and used one, but there was a high risk that someone else would be around and ask what I was doing."
B01KGZVTOE2,B01KGZVTOE,"Today, after, the bus was making good progress as I headed for the office. It was raining, and everyone else looked miserable, huddled into their overcoats, sour morning breath steaming up the windows. Life sparkled toward me through the drops of rain on the glass, shimmered fragrantly above the fug of wet clothes and damp feet.

I have always taken great pride in managing my life alone. I’m a sole survivor—I’m Eleanor Oliphant. I don’t need anyone else— there’s no big hole in my life, no missing part of my own particular puzzle. I am a self-contained entity. That’s what I’ve always told myself, at any rate. But last night, I’d found the love of my life. When I saw him walk onstage, I just knew. He was wearing a very stylish hat, but that wasn’t what drew me in. No—I’m not that shallow. He was wearing a three-piece suit, with the bottom button of his waistcoat unfastened. A true gentleman leaves the bottom button unfastened, Mummy always said—it was one of the signs to look out for, signifying as it did a sophisticate, an elegant man of the appropriate class and social standing. His handsome face, his voice . . ."
B01KGZVTOE3,B01KGZVTOE,"The employees I share an office with—Janey, Loretta, Bernadette and Billy—would notice if I didn’t turn up. After a few days (I’ve often wondered how many) they would worry that I hadn’t phoned in sick— so unlike me — and they’d dig out my address from the personnel files. I suppose they’d call the police in the end, wouldn’t they? Would the officers break down the front door? Find me, covering their faces, gagging at the smell? That would give them something to talk about in the office. They hate me, but they don’t actually wish me dead. I don’t think so, anyway.

I went to the doctor yesterday. It feels like eons ago. I got the young doctor this time, the pale chap with the red hair, which I was pleased about. The younger they are, the more recent their training, and that can only be a good thing. I hate it when I get old Dr. Wilson; she’s about sixty, and I can’t imagine she knows much about the latest drugs and medical breakthroughs. She can barely work the computer.

The doctor was doing that thing where they talk to you but don’t look at you, reading my notes on the screen, hitting the return key with increasing ferocity as he scrolled down."
B01KG5GQDS0,B01KG5GQDS,"* *

The men in the office go through what has to be done, coldly and dispassionately, as if they were talking about replacing a piece of furniture. In the old team photograph, Peter Andersson is standing in the middle; he was team captain then, GM now. It’s the perfect success story— the men in the room know the importance of building up that sort of mythology for the media as well as the fans. Next to Peter in the photograph stands Sune, the A-team coach, who persuaded Peter to move home from Canada with his family after his career as a professional player came to an end. The pair of them rebuilt the youth team with the ambition of one day having the best junior team in the country. Everyone laughed back then, but no one’s laughing now. Tomorrow those juniors are playing a semifinal game, and next year Kevin Erdahl and a few of the others will be moving up to the A-team, the sponsors will pile millions into the club, and their challenge to get back to the elite will begin in earnest. And that wouldn’t have happened without Peter, who has always been Sune’s best pupil.

One of the sponsors looks at his watch irritably."
B01KG5GQDS1,B01KG5GQDS,"He’s got a set of golf clubs in the car that he uses maybe twice each summer if he’s lucky. His work as GM takes up all his time: he negotiates contracts with players, talks to agents on the phone, sits in a dark video-room studying potential recruits. But this is only a small club, so when he’s done with his own work he helps the caretaker change fluorescent light bulbs and sharpen skates, reserves buses for away matches, orders equipment, and acts as a travel agent and building manager, spending as many hours maintaining the rink as he does building the team. That takes the rest of each day. Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life, it wants to be all of it.

When Peter accepted the post, he spent a whole night talking on the phone to Sune, the man who has been coach of Beartown’s A-team since Peter was a boy. It was Sune who taught Peter to skate, who offered him a place to stay when the boy’s own home was full of alcohol and bruises. He became far more of a mentor and father figure than a coach, and there have been times in Peter’s life when the old man has been the only person he felt he could really trust."
B01KG5GQDS2,B01KG5GQDS,"That’s how they describe it, when the men with all the influence and money just happen to gather to drink coffee together in the same place so early in the morning that not even the local reporters have woken up yet.

Beartown Ice Hockey’s coffee machine is in even greater need of a serious cleaning than the club’s president, so no one is here on account of the contents of their cups. Each man in the room has his own agenda, his own ambitions for a successful club, but they have one important thing in common: they agree on who ought to be fired.

* * *

Peter was born and raised in Beartown, and he has been a lot of different men here: a kid in skating classes, a promising junior, the youngest player on the A-team, the team captain who almost made them the best in the country, the big star who went professional in the NHL, and finally the hero who returned home to become GM.

And at this precise moment he is a man who is swaying sleepily back and forth in the hall of his small house, hitting his head on the hat rack roughly every third time and muttering,"
B01KG5GQDS3,B01KG5GQDS,"This is no longer going to be a town languishing forgotten in the lower leagues. They’re going back to the elite again, to challenge the very biggest teams.

The club’s president is sitting at his desk. He’s the sweatiest man in the whole town, constantly worried, like a child who’s stolen something, and he’s sweating more than ever today. His shirt is littered with crumbs as he munches a sandwich so messily that you can’t help wondering if he’s actually misunderstood the whole concept of eating. He does that when he’s nervous. This is his office, but he has less power than any of the other men there.

Seen from the outside, a club’s hierarchy is simple: the board appoints a president, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the club, and the president in turn appoints a general manager, who in turn recruits A-team players and employs coaches. The coaches pick the teams and no one pokes their oar into anyone else’s job. But behind closed doors it’s very different, and the club’s president always has reason to sweat. The men around him are board members and sponsors, one of them is a local councilor, and collectively they represent the largest investors and biggest employers in the whole district."
B003JFJHTS0,B003JFJHTS,"She was the lead soprano. She was ash blond, petite, with a snub nose and huge blue eyes which she’d turn upwards during hymns. She could smile and cry at the same time, one tear or two sliding gracefully down her cheek, as if on cue, as her voice lifted through its highest notes, tremulous, effortless. It was after that she went on to other things.

The woman sitting in front of me was Serena Joy. Or had been, once. So it was worse than I thought.

4

I walk along the gravel path that divides the back lawn, neatly, like a hair parting. It has rained during the night; the grass to either side is damp, the air humid. Here and there are worms, evidence of the fertility of the soil, caught by the sun, half dead; flexible and pink, like lips.

I open the white picket gate and continue, past the front lawn and towards the front gate. In the driveway, one of the Guardians assigned to our household is washing the car. That must mean the Commander is in the house, in his own quarters, past the dining room and beyond, where he seems to stay most of the time."
B003JFJHTS1,B003JFJHTS,"As for my husband, she said, he’s just that. My husband. I want that to be perfectly clear. Till death do us part. It’s final.

Yes, ma’am, I said again, forgetting. They used to have dolls, for little girls, that would talk if you pulled a string at the back; I thought I was sounding like that, voice of a monotone, voice of a doll. She probably longed to slap my face. They can hit us, there’s Scriptural precedent. But not with any implement. Only with their hands.

It’s one of the things we fought for, said the Commander’s Wife, and suddenly she wasn’t looking at me, she was looking down at her knuckled, diamond-studded hands, and I knew where I’d seen her before.

The first time was on television, when I was eight or nine. It was when my mother was sleeping in, on Sunday mornings, and I would get up early and go to the television set in my mother’s study and flip through the channels, looking for cartoons. Sometimes when I couldn’t find any I would watch the Growing Souls Gospel Hour, where they would tell Bible stories for children and sing hymns. One of the women was called Serena Joy."
B003JFJHTS2,B003JFJHTS,"I know you aren’t stupid, she went on. She inhaled, blew out the smoke. I’ve read your file. As far as I’m concerned, this is like a business transaction. But if I get trouble, I’ll give trouble back. You understand?

Yes, ma’am, I said.

Don’t call me ma’am, she said irritably. You’re not a Martha.

I didn’t ask what I was supposed to call her, because I could see that she hoped I would never have the occasion to call her anything at all. I was disappointed. I wanted, then, to turn her into an older sister, a motherly figure, someone who would understand and protect me. The Wife in my posting before this had spent most of her time in her bedroom; the Marthas said she drank. I wanted this one to be different. I wanted to think I would have liked her, in another time and place, another life. But I could see already that I wouldn’t have liked her, nor she me.

She put her cigarette out, half smoked, in a little scrolled ashtray on the lamp table beside her. She did this decisively, one jab and one grind, not the series of genteel taps favored by many of the Wives."
B003JFJHTS3,B003JFJHTS,"Now her face was on a level with mine. I thought I recognized her; or at least there was something familiar about her. A little of her hair was showing, from under her veil. It was still blond. I thought then that maybe she bleached it, that hair dye was something else she could get through the black market, but I know now that it really is blond. Her eyebrows were plucked into thin arched lines, which gave her a permanent look of surprise, or outrage, or inquisitiveness, such as you might see on a startled child, but below them her eyelids were tired-looking. Not so her eyes, which were the flat hostile blue of a midsummer sky in bright sunlight, a blue that shuts you out. Her nose must once have been what was called cute but now was too small for her face. Her face was not fat but it was large. Two lines led downward from the corners of her mouth; between them was her chin, clenched like a fist.

I want to see as little of you as possible, she said. I expect you feel the same way about me.

I didn’t answer, as a yes would have been insulting, a no contradictory."
B01MSMKVWD0,B01MSMKVWD,"There was a small kitchenette just before the bedroom, with a small table and stovetop neatly set up. I pushed open the door and found Amber slipping a dress over her uniform.

I glowered at the dress while placing the bag on the bed and unzipping it. Sighing, I began pulling the folded items out and examining them. The suit was a simple gray—a little threadbare, but serviceable. A gray-blue button-down shirt and a black tie were next, followed by a fake beard and a small box of pills labeled Deepvox.

As I set them out one by one, I felt a pang of déjà vu. The last time I had been in Patrus, Lee had given me similar items to help with his mission. Dressing like a man had afforded me more liberties around Patrus, but it had also carried a great risk. Any woman caught impersonating a male would face punishment.

Not to mention it was downright uncomfortable. The opposite sex—especially the Patrian ones—were still a giant mystery to me. Acting like one was almost impossible, so most of the time I had tried to keep my head down and my mouth shut.

Amber was looking at me inquisitively while I started unfolding the clothes."
B01MSMKVWD1,B01MSMKVWD,"The trees and sounds of The Green were also starting to fade, and I knew that in a few hours, we were going to be in even more danger than before. Yet in that moment, even with everything weighing heavily on me, I felt a strange contentment rolling over me.

It was the knowledge that I was finally doing something to help Viggo. Two weeks of waiting, trying to be patient when every day felt like the slow grinding of teeth. Now, in this moment, we were moving toward a goal where I could finally help him, and there was no turning back.

Owen called my name. Turning, I saw him holding a bag and waving an arm, beckoning me over. I noticed that he had taken his mask off, and I turned to Alejandro, who was in the process of taking his off as well. Grabbing the straps of my own mask, I removed it, taking a deep breath of fresh air and releasing it with a small sigh.

Then I moved toward Owen, hoping to finally glean more details of the mission ahead of us.

Violet

As I stared at the bag in Owen’s hand, resentment and understanding warred within me."
B01MSMKVWD2,B01MSMKVWD,"From what I had seen of Patrian marriages, men tended to expect the woman to jump through hoops and fulfill their every demand. Or at least, that was what the Matrus government would have us believe.

The truth was, I’d only had a handful of experiences with Patrian males. Viggo was perhaps one of the more equitable males I had met. There was my cousin Cad, but I hadn’t spoken to him since he’d tried to help me smuggle my brother to safety. I wasn’t even sure if he was married, but I could imagine that he would be kinder to his wife than the other males of Patrus.

The laws of Patrus considered women no more than property, and the rules for women were in strict adherence to that. They couldn’t even be in public without a male escort—if they were, they could be arrested, or even worse. I shuddered thinking about the Porteque men who had cornered me in the alley— my first encounter with those brutes. If it hadn’t been for Viggo’s interference, they would have dragged me off.

I shook my head to clear my thoughts and shifted my gaze back to Alejandro, who was looking at me knowingly."
B01MSMKVWD3,B01MSMKVWD,"The man seemed sweet, if not a little eccentric, and since no one else seemed interested in talking to pass the time, I was going to make do where I could. Owen just needed to trust that I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize the mission.

Just like I needed to trust that he knew what he was doing, and that he wasn’t doing anything to set me up.

It was unfair to Owen, but I couldn’t help feel a little doubt. The last mission I’d been on with a partner had ended with me having to kill him, and I wasn’t eager to relive that experience. I did trust Owen, but the doubt was always there in the back of my mind. I knew it wasn’t rational, but drawing from history was never a bad thing. It kept me from blindly trusting people, and helped me keep an eye out for potential threats to me or the mission.

Alejandro moved back to the captain’s station, and I followed him. I moved at a slower pace, my legs and arms stiff and ungainly against the roll of the deck. He shot a glance back at me, a knowing smile on his lips."
B07BD1YK840,B07BD1YK84,"Or not alone in bed on a Saturday night with a woman who turned out to be a little too reserved and aloof and you needed a little fiery inspiration to get the job done.

Fiery inspiration. Fuck, that was funny.

And hot.

Grimacing, I adjusted the crotch of my pants as they threatened to grow too tight for comfort. I didn’t want to have to hide an erection from Emme when she arrived. I’d never live it down.

I closed my eyes and tried to think of something else, something not sexy. This morning’s contentious arbitration. This afternoon’s tense phone call with my mother. That ridiculous blackened rabbit. Those things distracted me for maybe five seconds, but then my mind took an unauthorized detour to Emme crawling toward me on her hands and knees, slowly this time, her eyes hooded and hungry instead of wide and panicked.

Oh, fuck.

Heat rushed my chest, making my sweater feel tight and itchy. I couldn’t breathe for a second. My stomach muscles were clenched tight as blood rushed between my legs. I imagined her looking up at me. Her hands sliding up my thighs. Her fingers unbuckling my belt. Her tongue wetting her lips. The sound of a zipper being lowered.

My cock jumped."
B07BD1YK841,B07BD1YK84,"I always teased her that she wore her heart on her sleeve and a sign on her heart that said HOMELESS— PLEASE HELP.

Not that she was needy in a clingy sort of way, because she wasn’t. There was something kind of nice about the way she needed me, actually— I think it was that she didn’t want to need me, and she would have argued until her dying breath that she didn’t need me, not really. It made it kind of fun in an antagonistic way to be the one she turned to all the time. Mostly I liked to make fun of her for it, sort of like the way you’d poke at your best friend’s younger sister.

But no matter how cute that sister was in her own hot-tempered-girl-next-door way (and probably a firecracker in bed), you couldn’t sleep with her.

Even if you sometimes thought about it.

Even if you sometimes sneaked a peek at her legs in that short black skirt. Or her ass in her tight jeans. Or that little, accidental glimpse of a bra strap when a sleeve slipped from her shoulder.

Even if you sometimes had to work really, really hard not to fantasize about her while you were in the shower. Or alone in bed on a Saturday morning."
B07BD1YK842,B07BD1YK84,"It’s not only about sex. You wouldn’t understand because you are not a relationship person; therefore, you are not qualified to give advice on them—not that I asked for it.

But I didn’t need to be a relationship person to smell Richard’s bullshit. It stunk to high heaven. It was amazing to me that someone as smart and sexy as Emme would fall for a guy like that.

But what could you expect from a woman who thought Daniel Craig made a good James Bond?

After ordering the food, I wandered over to the windows with my drink and looked out at the city while I waited for her knock. It was kind of surprising to me how much I liked spending an evening with her, given that our relationship was not now and had never been sexual, and sex was usually the way I preferred to connect with women. Our friendship was pretty unlikely on all levels, really. I didn’t generally gravitate toward needy women, preferring those who were independent, maybe even a little aloof or reserved, those looking for short-term pleasure rather than long-term connection—the total opposite of Emme. That woman was a no-holding-back, no-poker-face-whatsoever, here-have-some-feelings Seeker of The One."
B07BD1YK843,B07BD1YK84,"I thought she looked better with a few more curves on her, anyway, but I couldn’t tell her that.

Occasionally I wondered what the fuck the guys she dated were saying or not saying to her to make her anything less than one hundred percent confident in her skin when she was so confident about other parts of her life—her job, style, her family relationships, her opinions. But then I’d remember the kinds of guys she chose—nothing but douchebags and assholes, none of whom were worse than fucking Richard the Turd, and that’s saying a lot. The entire time she was with him, I wanted to tell her what a weasel he would turn out to be.

I’ve known a million guys like him, guys who lie and cheat and don’t give a shit about anyone but themselves. (I swear to God, half of them are lawyers in this city. And their pants are always wrinkled.) But I never said a word because it wasn’t my place, and she wouldn’t have believed me, anyway. The last time I tried to give her dating advice, our conversation went something like this:

Me: What do you see in that guy?

Her: Potential.

Me: Potential is not sexy.

Her: Relationships take time and effort."
B01N7EQOFA0,B01N7EQOFA,"This one’s speaking loudly, calling for everyone to pack up, break’s over, they need to do another five miles before dark. Ykka. You lift your head as she gets close enough, and it’s in this moment that you realize you think of her as a friend. You realize it because it feels good to hear her voice, and to see her resolve out of the swirling ash. Last time you saw her, she was in serious danger of being murdered by hostile stone eaters attacking Castrima-under. That’s one of the reasons you fought back, using the crystals of Castrima-under to ensnare the attackers; you wanted her, and all the other orogenes of Castrima, and by extension all the people of Castrima who depended on those orogenes, to live.

So you smile. It’s weak. You’re weak. Which is why it actually hurts when Ykka turns to you and her lips tighten in what is unmistakably disgust.

She’s pulled the cloth wrapping off the lower half of her face. Beyond her gray-and-kohl eye makeup, which not even the end of the world will stop her from wearing, you can’t make out her eyes behind her makeshift goggles—a pair of spectacles that she’s wrapped rags around to keep ash out."
B01N7EQOFA1,B01N7EQOFA,"Beyond the fact that it’s still attached to your body, it’s got the shape you know like your own— well. Not as graceful and tapered as it used to be when you were young. You were heavyset for a while, and that still shows along the plush-looking forearm and slight sag under your upper arm. The bicep is more defined than it used to be; two years of surviving. The hand is clamped into a fist, the whole arm slightly cocked at the elbow. You always did tend to make fists while you were wrestling with a particularly difficult bit of orogeny.

But the mole, which once sat in the middle of your forearm like a tiny black target, is gone. You can’t turn the arm over for a look at your elbow, so you touch it. The keloid scar from where you once fell is impossible to feel anymore, though it should be slightly raised compared to the skin around it. That level of fine definition has vanished into a texture that is gritty and dense, like unpolished sandstone. Perhaps self-destructively you rub it, but no particles break off beneath your fingertips; it’s more solid than it looks. The color is an even, allover grayish tan that looks nothing like your skin."
B01N7EQOFA2,B01N7EQOFA,"But she’s the one to help when Lerna slides an arm under you, levering you up from prone to sitting. Even this takes an effort of ages. You get dizzy the instant you’re upright, but it passes. Something’s wrong, though. It’s a testament to how much you’ve been through, maybe, that you seem to have developed a permanently crooked posture, your right shoulder sagging and arm dragging as if

as if it is made of

Oh. Oh.

The others stop bothering you as you realize what’s happened. They watch you heft the shoulder, as much as you can, to try to drag your right arm more into view. It’s heavy. Your shoulder hurts when you do this, even though most of the joint is still flesh, because the weight pulls against that flesh. Some of the tendons have transformed, but they’re still attached to living bone. Gritty bits of something chafe within what should be a smooth ball-and-socket. It doesn’t hurt as much as you thought it would, though, after watching Alabaster go through this. So that’s something.

The rest of the arm, from which someone has stripped your shirt and jacket sleeves in order to bare it, has changed nearly past recognition. It’s your arm, you’re pretty sure."
B01N7EQOFA3,B01N7EQOFA,"You’re on a stretcher, just two poles with some stitched hide between them, being carried by four people. One of them calls out, and other calls respond from farther away. Lots of calls. Lots of people.

Another call from somewhere far away, and the people carrying you come to a halt. They glance at each other and set you down with the ease and uniformity of people who’ve practiced doing the same maneuver in unison many times. You feel the stretcher settle onto a soft, powdery layer of ash, over a thicker layer of ash, over what might be a road. Then your stretcher-bearers move away, opening packs and settling down in a ritual that is familiar from your own months on the road. Breaktime.

You know this ritual. You should get up. Eat something. Check your boots for holes or stones, your feet for unnoticed sores, make sure your mask —wait , are you wearing one? If everyone else is … You kept that in your runny-sack, didn’t you? Where is your runny-sack?

Someone walks out of the gloom and ashfall. Tall, plateau-broad, identity stripped by the clothes and mask but restored by the familiar frizzy texture of the ashblow mane. She crouches near your head."
B01NCWWI5L0,B01NCWWI5L,"We have a seven-second delay for just this reason. Now, I believe we've got Sarah on line two. Hello Sarah…

Sarah: Hello? Am I on?

Gerry: Yes, Sarah, you're live on the air.

Sarah: I'd like to hear the new song by Adele, please.

Gerry: I'm afraid we don't do requests on this show. Now, what's your point about Skylark?

Sarah: Skylark? Oh that bunch of—

Gerry: And she has been cut off too. Again – please – watch the swearing! Let's take a song. Ah for… really? All right, by sheer coincidence, here's the new one from Adele.

Paul had received the call from a Sergeant Sinead Geraghty from Howth Garda Station at about 10 pm the night before. He had been taking Maggie for about her fifteenth walk of the day at the time. The sergeant had explained the situation to him, and then he agreed to meet her out in Howth the next morning. He didn't mention it to Phil when he got back to the car. He would have had questions. Phil always had questions. Paul hadn't known what to think, so he'd decided to try and not think about it at all until the next morning."
B01NCWWI5L1,B01NCWWI5L,"No, she didn't hate the job, she had just always felt like she was supposed to do something more with her life. She was going to have to now, she was about to get booted out on her arse.

The fire door banged open and Dr Luke Mullins stepped out. His hawkish nose, combined with the garish waistcoats he had a misjudged affection for, made him appear older than his forty-or-so years. He always looked like he was about ten pounds too heavy to comfortably fit into his suit, like he wasn't so much dressing for the job he wanted as for the body he hoped to attain. His standoffish manner made him one of the less popular doctors amongst the nursing staff, but Brigit had never minded him much. He was all business but he treated everyone the same, being just as happy to launch a rocket up another doctor's arse as he was a nurse's.

This unofficial smoking area, really just a shallow alcove between buildings, was normally the exclusive habitat of the nursing staff. They shy away from the officially sanctioned areas as the public tend to get hypocritically judgemental if they find themselves puffing away beside a medical professional.

Dr Mullins looked around awkwardly, like he'd forgotten what it was he had come out for."
B01NCWWI5L2,B01NCWWI5L,"As the glass doors swished closed behind them, Paul could see Hartigan putting his arm around Maloney's shoulder genially. Blake, in conversation with one of the lawyers, barked out a laugh.

Paul turned to go. He needed to find Phil and the car fast. As he hurried away, he glanced back to see Dessie O'Connell standing silently amongst the throng, wordlessly holding up the picture of his dead wife whose name Paul couldn't remember.

Chapter Three

Brigit took a long drag on her cigarette and looked at the trees. She'd miss them. Hospital grounds always had such nice trees. There was something very comforting about watching them sway in the soft summer breeze.

It was not like she had actually liked nursing, she told herself. She hadn't actively disliked it either, though. It was supposed to have just been a means to an end. Train as a nurse, they'd told her, and you can see the world. People will always need their arses wiped – that'd been the half-joking sales-pitch they'd given each other in training. Nurses did a lot more than that, of course, and up to a certain point she had enjoyed that side of things. Helping someone get better, or at least feel better about what life they had left. That wasn't nothing."
B01NCWWI5L3,B01NCWWI5L,"His expression was one of distaste, as if all of this was a great inconvenience, distracting him from something far more important. Hartigan, on the other hand, while about the same age as Blake, was all chiselled features and natural grace. He wore the white shirt and tieless black suit combination that Paul realised he'd seen him wearing in every picture. His hair was brushed back and slightly tousled, with the suggestion of a widow's peak that hinted at a no-expense-spared battle against male pattern baldness; one he was winning. In contrast to the other two, Maloney looked rumpled and edgy in a suit that seemed slightly too big for him, the sun bouncing off his irredeemably bald pate. His small eyes peered out apprehensively from round, frameless glasses as his hands clasped at each other nervously. He reminded Paul of Penfold from Danger Mouse, minus the cuddliness. He looked the type to stand in the background, cheering the big boys on while they stole your lunch money.

Hartigan strode down the steps confidently, and raised his hands for silence. He left a few seconds to let the undignified scrum of journalists holding out mics and digital recorders settle down."
B01N4QZ0KW0,B01N4QZ0KW,"She thought back to the time she’d researched Jackson Parrish, googling his name for hours after she read an article on the international development company he’d founded. Her breath had caught when his picture filled the screen. With thick black hair, full lips, and cobalt-blue eyes, he could have easily been on the big screen. She’d clicked on an interview in Forbes magazine that featured him and how he built his Fortune 500 company. The next link—an article in Vanity Fair—wrote about his marriage to the beautiful Daphne, ten years younger than he. Amber had gazed at the picture of their two adorable children, taken on the beach in front of a gray-and-white clapboard mansion. She’d looked up everything she could about the Parrishes, and when she read about Julie’s Smile, the foundation founded by Daphne and dedicated to raising money for cystic fibrosis, the idea came to her. The first step in the plan that developed in her mind was to move to Bishops Harbor.

When she thought back to the small-time marriage she’d tried to engineer back in Missouri, it made her want to laugh. That had ended very badly, but she wouldn’t make the same mistakes this time.

Now she picked up her wineglass and lifted it in salute to her reflection in the microwave oven."
B01N4QZ0KW1,B01N4QZ0KW,"Amber had seen her at the gym in her tiny shorts and sports bra, working out like mad, but Bunny looked at her blankly, as if she’d never laid eyes on her before. Amber wanted to remind her, Oh, yes. I know you. You’re the one who brags about screwing around on your husband to your girl posse.

And then there was Meredith, who didn’t at all fit in with the rest of them. Her clothing was expensive but subdued, not like the flashy garb of the other women. She wore small gold earrings and a single strand of yellowed pearls against her brown sweater. The length of her tweed skirt was awkward, neither long nor short enough to be fashionable. As the meeting progressed, it became apparent that she was different in more ways than appearance. She sat erect in her chair, shoulders back and head held high, with an imposing bearing of wealth and breeding. And when she spoke, there was just the hint of a boarding-school accent, enough to make her words sound so much more insightful than the others’ as they discussed the silent auction and the prizes secured so far. Exotic vacations, diamond jewelry, vintage wines— the list went on and on, each item more expensive than the last.

As the meeting came to a close, Meredith walked over and sat beside Amber."
B01N4QZ0KW2,B01N4QZ0KW,"They would see her as young and nondescript, simply a worker bee Daphne had deigned to reach down and anoint as a helper in her charity efforts.

She opened the car door and stepped onto the crushed stone driveway. It looked as if each piece of gravel cushioning her steps had been measured for uniformity and purity, and perfectly raked and polished. As she neared the house, she took her time studying the grounds and dwelling. She realized she would be entering through the back—the front would, of course, face the water— but it was, nevertheless, a most gracious facade. To her left stood a white arbor bedecked with the summer’s last wisteria, and two long benches sat just beyond it. Amber had read about this kind of wealth, had seen countless pictures in magazines and online tours of the homes of movie stars and the superrich. But this was the first time she’d actually seen it up close.

She climbed the wide stone steps to the landing and rang the bell. The door was oversize, with large panes of beveled glass, allowing Amber a view down the long corridor that ran to the front of the house. She could see the dazzling blue of the water from where she stood, and then, suddenly, Daphne was there, holding the door open and smiling at her."
B01N4QZ0KW3,B01N4QZ0KW,"She closed her eyes and sat for a moment, taking slow, deep breaths and going over in her head the information she’d memorized over the last few weeks. She’d dressed carefully this morning, her straight brown hair held back from her face with a tortoiseshell headband and her makeup minimal—just the tiniest hint of blush on her cheeks and slightly tinted balm on her lips. She wore a neatly pressed beige twill skirt with a long-sleeved white cotton T-shirt, both of which she’d ordered from an L.L.Bean catalog. Her sandals were sturdy and plain, good no-nonsense walking shoes without any touch of femininity. The ugly large-framed glasses she’d found at the last minute completed the look she was after. When she took one last glimpse in the mirror before leaving her apartment, she’d been pleased. She looked plain, even mousy. Someone who would never in a million years be a threat to anyone—especially not someone like Daphne Parrish.

Though she knew she ran a slight risk of appearing rude, Amber had shown up just a little early. She’d be able to have some time alone with Daphne and would also be there before any of the other women arrived, always an edge when introductions were made."
B071NCQJ4L0,B071NCQJ4L,"She hoped to correct her mother’s impression of her life in New York City. Camilla, she had sensed, inferred pretension from the mere fact that it was not Boston.

The truth was, Gwen thought she’d better get her mother down to New York in a hurry because soon Dan’s clerkship was ending and he’d be starting at a law firm. At that point, with the increased income, there probably would be pretensions—doormen and a cleaning woman. Camilla had made sure that all through elementary and high school, Gwen studied hard. For thirteen years, she had made sure. But Gwen’s mother hadn’t known— how could she—that in Gwen’s generation, education would beget New York City would beget hired help, taxis, parking garages. Gwen would have to break her in gently.

Or so she thought.

It hadn’t worked out like that, though.

A few weeks after he started at Buckland, Brandt, Dan came home with an itchy red patch on his forearm. Gwen’s calamine lotion and baking-soda baths did nothing to soothe it. By Thanksgiving the rash had spread to his back, and by Christmas there were white spots on top of the red and they were creeping up his neck and down his legs, and Dan no longer rolled up his shirtsleeves."
B071NCQJ4L1,B071NCQJ4L,"It was one of the characteristics of New York that had made her feel most alien when they’d arrived a decade ago, when Dan took a clerkship out of law school on the Second Circuit: that this was a city of people who couldn’t be bothered to cut up their own cantaloupe or push a grocery cart down an aisle to stock up for more than a day. It was a relief when she ran out of milk and had to run down and buy a quart—when she could show it wasn’t personal.

The outer door of their building closed with a whump behind them. Kicking aside the scattering of takeout menus, Gwen dug out her keys and let the two of them through the second door. Mary went ahead, doing her posting-pony trot and clucking, while Gwen held the door for another tenant—an older man in a porkpie hat who walked with a limp. He didn’t thank Gwen but proceeded through the door with an avaricious look in his eye and lumbered quickly toward the elevator in the back. He was carrying a tabloid newspaper in a plastic bag that swung manically from the crook in his arm. Gwen hurried, too, but stopped quickly at the phalanx of mailboxes to remove the mostly junk mail that was stuffed into their box, knowing how long it would take for the shambling elevator to return if she missed it."
B071NCQJ4L2,B071NCQJ4L,"She didn’t seem to notice that the mothers, who were keeping an ear cocked for their children’s names, were all glancing at the labels on the shopping bags and turning back to one another with raised eyebrows. Most people would have stowed them at home or in a waiting car. The New Mother—Minnie—was apparently ignorant of these subtleties. Or perhaps—the idea presented itself uncomfortably— she was simply uninterested in them? Gwen stared at her shoes, unable to believe a person could actually walk in them. They must’ve been four inches high, the metal heel spiked to a fine and frightening point, as if the point she made by wearing them was far beyond ambulatory. But walk she did—triumphantly, weaving confidently through the crowd, her shoulders thrust back, her balance as light and careless as if she were in the old running shoes that Gwen herself wore. And that was the only way to wear shoes like that, thought Gwen, who, despite the fact that she took no time at all with her own appearance, could be exacting about others’. In shoes that high, any telltale hunch of the shoulders, slump of the back, or grimace, and you looked— well, you looked like a prostitute at the end of a long night."
B071NCQJ4L3,B071NCQJ4L,"Nautauqua, where the Girl Scouts met, had the traffic circle and the fast-food franchises. But still: thirty years ago, Gwen Hogan—Gwen Babineau then—had spent afternoons playing dress-up at the Lyes’ house— not so very many of them, for her friendship with Rosemary had limped along rather than taken off. Then again, it had limped along awhile, as if neither girl was willing to be the one to call a halt. What Gwen remembered most was the feeling of luck she had when Philippa—who everyone said was going to be a model and who was already in a newspaper ad for the local Ford dealership—having no better options on the particular day, would join them. Both Gwen and Rose lacked imagination. Philippa Lye created the fantasy and then took you along on it. Rosemary complained often, to their mother, but Gwen was tickled to be lady-in-waiting to Philippa’s queen, the long-suffering hairdresser to her movie star. When Gwen thought of Philippa over the years, hearing snippets about her success—catalogs and a magazine cover; a stint in Japan— she felt complacent, as one does when one’s own opinion is corroborated by the universe.

Rosemary she thought of not at all.

In a stream of disgust, the taxi driver gesticulated violently and skidded off."
B006WEZ9TK0,B006WEZ9TK,"They looked just as they had in my mind’s eye back in Madison when Matthew had described the Old Lodge.

Henry seemed puzzled by my reaction to an ordinary dish of fruit but was too well bred to comment. We settled ourselves at the table, and a servant added fresh bread along with a platter of grapes and a bowl of apples to the still life before us. It was comforting to see such familiar fare. Henry helped himself, and I followed his example, carefully noting which foods he selected and how much of them he consumed. It was always the little differences that gave strangers away, and I wanted to appear as ordinary as possible. While we filled our plates, Matthew poured himself a glass of wine.

Throughout our meal Henry behaved with unfailing courtesy. He never asked me anything personal, nor did he pry into Matthew’s affairs. Instead he kept us laughing with tales of his dogs, his estates, and his martinet of a mother, all the while providing a steady supply of toasted bread from the fire. He was just beginning an account of moving house in London when a clatter arose in the courtyard. The earl, whose back was to the door, didn’t notice."
B006WEZ9TK1,B006WEZ9TK,"someone else’s petticoats; quilted stays to confine my athletic figure into a more traditionally feminine shape; an embroidered smock that smelled of lavender and cedar, with a high, ruffled neck; a black, bell-shaped skirt made of velvet; and Pierre’s best jacket, the only tailored article of clothing that was remotely my size. Try though she might, Françoise couldn’t button this last item over my breasts. I held my breath, tucked in my stomach, and hoped for a miracle as she pulled the corset’s laces tight, but nothing short of divine intervention was going to give me a sylphlike silhouette.

I asked Françoise a number of questions during the complicated process. Portraits of the period had led me to expect an unwieldy birdcage called a farthingale that would hold my skirts out at the hips, but Françoise explained that these were for more formal occasions. Instead she tied a stuffed cloth form shaped like a doughnut around my waist beneath my skirts. The only positive thing to say about it was that it held the layers of fabric away from my legs, enabling me to walk without too much difficulty—provided there was no furniture in the way and my destination could be reached if I moved in a straight line. But I would be expected to curtsy, too. Françoise quickly taught me how to do so while explaining how Henry Percy’s various titles worked — he was"

We arrived in an undignified heap of witch and vampire. Matthew was underneath me, his long limbs bent into an uncharacteristically awkward position. A large book was squashed between us, and the force of our landing sent the small silver figurine clutched in my hand sailing across the floor."

 Version_4

 To Lacey Baldwin Smith, master storyteller and historian,

who suggested some time ago that I should think about writing a novel."
B079WTRRY20,B079WTRRY2,"Twisting my body in the direction of the passenger window, I find it’s not so easy in the low-slung sporty seats. Arms still folded, I resolutely ignore the cocky man sitting next to me and stare as the city passes by. People mill on sidewalks or sit at outdoor café seating, some dressed in the colours of summer, some still in office wear, but all appear to be enjoying the respite of the cool evening air. I might have only been in London a few days but many of my preconceptions have been dashed. The grey weather for one, as the sun has shone almost continually since I arrived. Truthfully, I’m finding the city heat almost oppressive.

In the absence of our sniping banter, anxiety begins to creep in. The prospect of seeing Julian again, while a little thrilling, is also a lot terrifying. What happens if he doesn’t remember our meeting the same way? What happens if he’s met someone since then? And then there’s the proximity of the man next to me, and my undoubtable attraction to him. Will. I have to remember that this is his job—that I’m his job. And his reaction to me is nothing but make-believe. Fake prettiness spun to make a woman feel good."
B079WTRRY21,B079WTRRY2,"What is he—six-foot-two? Six-foot-three? Tall, anyway. Man.

And sweetheart? Love? Be still my little feminist heart—who doesn’t love to be endeared just a little bit? But, oh my Lord, this man’s voice? It’s like great sex —deep, with just a little rasp of rough, like the hint of it in his command when dealing with the mutt. Could be he’s bossy in bed, all commanding and strong. Not that I’m thinking about it. Because I’m not paying for sex, no matter what. Even if his accent does it for me. It’s so very English, with just a hint of something else sitting at the edge of certain words. Something that sounds almost Scandinavian, but what do I know?

Whatever his job description, Kallie couldn’t have chosen better. He’s my fantasy type, all right. But not the kind of man I usually date. There’s no mistaking him for a sweet beta.

What is it that makes English men so delicious? Not that I’ve been in London long enough to investigate whether this is a Sadie-centric phenomenon that appeals to all British men. Besides, they can’t all be like Mr Flirty Lips and Julian. Oh, Julian. The reason I’m here, I remind myself."
B079WTRRY22,B079WTRRY2,"And everyone lies a little in the quest to get laid. E-v-e-r-y-one.

But none of that matters right now. I’ve had a monumentally crappy day, so I’m in need of a distraction, and this beauty needs a date. Win-win. And if I can get her out of the door before the real dial-a-dick turns up, I think I’ll have done us both a favour tonight.

Chapter Four

SADIE

A date.

Fuck my life. This is far too surreal, even by Kallie’s standards.

I knew her family was wealthy, but when I’d picked up the keys from the porter downstairs earlier this week, a creeping sense of just how rich they were began to dawn.

But an escort?

A prostitute?

A gigolo?

Is this how rich people live? Ordering a man like he’s pizza? Even if he is, like, really delicious looking. And delicious smelling, and looks big enough to sate even the greediest of appetites . . .

So sue me, I looked. He appears to be packing, but so what? He might also have the longest, thickest lashes I’ve ever seen. And a strong jawline. And a full mouth seems to be a constant millisecond away from a full out flirty grin."
B079WTRRY23,B079WTRRY2,"And while you might think the possibility of disturbing someone getting shagged senseless on the opposite side of the door might be enough to make me swing on my heel and head for home, you’d be wrong.

Apart from the voyeuristic element, urgent sex happens to be one of my favourite things. Stumbling in through a front door so desperate that you can’t wait the extra few steps it might take to get to a bed. The absolute need at that moment. The collision of bodies. Mouths and fingers seeking pleasure, slippery and slick. The illicitness in this kind of coupling is unique.

But that’s not the reason I pause. It’s more that the possibility of this happening behind this particular door is slim.

No, not exactly slim. This isn’t an anomaly or an incongruency.

More like fucking impossible.

Because Mo, my neighbour, couldn’t get it up for a girl if he tried. And I know because I’ve known the man for years. He likes to wear a kaftan, for fuck’s sake.

Curiosity, I’m told, leads to trouble, but female trouble is the very best kind, in my opinion. So in my characteristic give-no-fucks way, I ring the doorbell, interested to find out exactly what’s going on here.

The dog barks.

A soft, feminine voice draws closer, her tone chastising. And this time, I hear the exact words."
B074656PYS0,B074656PYS,"I drove my blue suitcase, my Underwood Portable, and a box of books down to D.C. the next day. One of the housekeepers took me through the White House, up the stairs to Eleanor’s suite, blank and polite, as if she’d never seen me before, as if she’d never done my laundry or hemmed my skirt when I’d stayed for the weekend, but when she opened the door to my room, she smiled and put my typewriter on the desk. My new room adjoined Eleanor’s; it was her old sitting room.

I had a big desk, a bookshelf, and an old Windsor chair. I had two table lamps and a floor lamp. I had a bed, a dark velvet couch that had seen better days, which I pushed toward the corner, and an oak armoire big enough to hide in. The only thing between us was a wall covered with photographs and an old wooden door.

I spent about an hour, sitting upright on my twin bed, my hat and coat still on, staring at that door, willing it to let me in, to look down on the Rose Garden, to let me open the window to the big magnolia tree.

Eleanor finally came in and sat down next to me."
B074656PYS1,B074656PYS,"I hang her black coat in the closet, next to my navy-blue one, and my red scarf falls over them both. I’m sorry I’ve come.

Oh, Hick, she says, if you don’t hold me, I will die.

I climb in behind her and she undresses me with one long white hand, still not turning. I look out over her shoulder and watch people turn on their lights.

* * *

—

Eleven years ago we had our golden time and our first vacation. Maine and beyond was our golden hour. Hoover was out. Franklin was in. We all moved into the White House, friends, family, and me.

Eleanor and I had had our first private lunch at the White House, grinning and posing in front of the portraits like teenage girls. Why don’t you move in, she said. We have so much room.

I asked her what she meant and she said, again, We have so much room. I leaned over to kiss her and she pushed me away a little. I have some housekeeping to do, if you’re coming, she said. Why don’t you go and get your things?

I went back to Brooklyn and put my rent check, almost the full amount, in the mail."
B074656PYS2,B074656PYS,"She hands me her purse and her suitcase. I put down the bags and I put my arm around her waist. I try to pull her face to mine but she turns away and rests one hand on my shoulder, to take off her shoes.

She drops her hat, coat, and scarf on the big brocade armchair. She unbuttons her gray blouse and lets it fall to the floor. She walks into the bedroom, unzips her skirt, and I follow behind, picking up as we go. She sits on the edge of the bed in a ragged white slip she should have thrown out long before the war.

She takes the pins out of her gray hair and pulls off her awful lisle stockings. We fought about those stockings. I said that even in a war, the First Lady did not actually have to entertain royalty while wearing knit cotton stockings and she said that was exactly what the First Lady had to do. I stretch the stockings over the arm of the club chair and she shrugs.

She lies down on the bed, facing the wall, and lifts her right arm up behind her. Without turning to face me, she beckons me over."
B074656PYS3,B074656PYS,"’s death, and she cried for him, every night, as if he hadn’t broken everybody’s hearts, as if he hadn’t almost killed one of his own children and ruined the other five. She sat by Hall’s bed, looking like that Henry Adams statue she used to drag me to, the monument of transcendent misery Adams put up when his wife killed herself with cyanide. That’s what I am expecting, but I hope that in the mix of her feelings for Franklin, sorrow at his death, and grief for her children and for the country, she’ll be glad to see me. I want her to feel that with me, she’s home, like it used to be. She sent me away eight years ago, and I left. Two days ago, she called me to come and I came.

The buzzer rings, which means her hands are full and she can’t get to her key.

I open the door and Eleanor is leaning against the wall, paper white.

Her beautiful blue eyes are red-rimmed, all the way around, and she looks as if she has never smiled in her life. Her dusty black coat is enormous on her, and her lisle stockings bag. I kiss her because I always kiss her hello, when we are alone and we’re on speaking terms, and she turns her cheek toward me and looks away."
B01LB4O01I0,B01LB4O01I,"Paul could still remember the incident from his youth when Gary Kearney, the ex-boxer, had confronted Bunny outside Phelan’s pub. Paul had been one of a group of young fellas who’d been playing ball nearby at the time. Alan Murphy had been in Paul’s class. Kearney had recently shacked up with Alan’s ma. A few months after Kearney moved in, Alan had started falling down stairs quite a lot, only they lived in a ground floor flat. Bunny had dropped over and had a long talk with Alan’s ma about the situation, which Kearney had not appreciated. When Bunny had offered to settle it like gentlemen, Kearney couldn’t believe his luck. He’d gotten half way through taking his coat off, when Bunny pounced. Kearney never even got a punch off. When it was done, Bunny handed a roll of tightly wrapped coins he’d been holding in his hands to Alan, and told him to take the rest of the lads down to the shops for sweets. After that, Kearney moved out and Alan never fell down the stairs again. Kearney also spoke with a stammer for the rest of his life.

Bunny noticed that the front of his suit was covered in flakes of croissant and turned his eyes to heaven."
B01LB4O01I1,B01LB4O01I,"Admittedly, if he’d known what Brigit’s driving was like at that point, Paul would have re-evaluated that assessment. Somebody once said you know you’re getting old when the policemen start looking young, but Paul was pretty sure Garda Danaher would’ve looked young to anyone. He gave off the air of a young fella who’d borrowed his daddy’s uniform and was playing dress-up. There was a distinct aroma of Clearasil and terror about him. Paul guessed Danaher was the sort who had secretly longed his whole life to be blessed with a commanding presence, and was now gutted to find out it didn’t come with the uniform.

There’d been a brief discussion of whether or not Paul was under arrest for anything, Brigit going into a spiel about Miranda Rights. Paul was pretty sure a lot of it had been gleaned from American cop shows. Officer Danaher appeared to be more intimidated by being spoken to by a member of the public in possession of breasts than he was her in-depth legal knowledge. The poor lad hadn’t known where to look but he kept looking there anyway. Paul ended up feeling bad for him, and so he gave him his address."
B01LB4O01I2,B01LB4O01I,"The man grinned like minimum wage workers wore seasonal fancy dress; as if he were being forced to comply with a memo from head office. Actually, come to think of it, this really wasn’t the offices of Greevy and Co Solicitors. Paul noted that his subconscious had somehow upgraded the decor to be all mahogany and padded leather, even adding an imposing grandfather clock in the corner. In reality, their offices were a couple of dingy rooms in Phibsboro, located above a sofa shop that had recently, after a three-year-long closing-down sale, unexpectedly closed down.

This dream was one of only two Paul could ever remember having, although both recurred with great frequency. This was the one he normally preferred. Apparently it was unusual to be aware that you were dreaming while it was actually happening. Knowing he was didn’t mean he could wake himself up though. He seemed to have no choice but to sit there most every night while the whole thing repeated over and over again.

Greevy looked up from the leather-bound book and coughed pointedly, clearly unhappy with not being paid full attention to. That was another thing, the book. Fidelma’s actual Will had just been a few pieces of mundane A4.

Greevy continued reading:"
B01LB4O01I3,B01LB4O01I,"It was especially unnerving coming from one who had just explained to him how he now had seven stitches in his right shoulder. It was heavily bandaged and the attached arm was in a sling to keep the pressure off.

From what Paul could gather, he’d been transferred by ambulance from St Kilda’s Hospice to the A&E unit at St Katherine’s. He’d been pretty out of it. He guessed that, somewhere along the line, he’d been given something for the pain.

Dr Sinha was 27 and from India. He had a full licence to practise medicine over there, having qualified third in his class. Then he’d passed the Irish clinical exams first time and with flying colours. He decided to come to Ireland as he’d heard how friendly the people were. He was educated in an international school, which explained him having considerably better English than anyone else in the building.

The reason Paul knew all this was that he’d listened to Dr Sinha patiently explain it three times to the drunken husband of the woman with a broken leg on the far side of the ward.

Hubby was a lawyer and had spent a considerable amount of time trying to negotiate his way out of the shattered limb on his wife’s behalf."
B079LF1PDH0,B079LF1PDH,"and I did a fair amount of sightseeing with her gang. She’s the kind of person who spends three weeks in a new city and becomes the leader of a funky group made up of expats and locals. Which means that, suddenly, I know a bunch of people in Paris I would’ve never met on my own.

Lucky me.

When I lie in bed at night, and all kinds of unwanted thoughts rush into my head, I can’t help wondering about Zach. Was his flirting with me two weeks ago some weird anomaly? Did I imagine it? Or was it real, until he reminded himself I’m his son’s nanny? Does he wonder about the connection between Noah and me?

Is there a connection?

Marguerite keeps telling me there is, but I doubt it. Even more than Noah’s feelings, I doubt mine. If I were in love with him, why would I wish he looked more like Zach, sounded more like Zach, moved more like Zach? I have no prior experience with romantic love, but I think I’d want the object of my affection to remain exactly the way he is, and not morph into his friend’s clone.

The doorbell rings.

Sam looks up from his Lego house."
B079LF1PDH1,B079LF1PDH,"Tonight, as soon as I’m alone, I’ll call Sophie—quite possibly the hottest woman both sides of the Atlantic—and ask her out.

SIX

Uma

I’m building a Lego garage that will stand next to Sam’s Lego house. Sam is eager to complete the whole project by the time Zach comes home so he can prove his engineering acumen to his dad. And the reason he’s so eager is that he was unable to fix his helicopter after it finally died a few days ago. Neither could I. Or Zach.

After I finish my task and pick up my embroidery frame to practice French knots, I am reminded of the weekend in Provence.

Again.

Just the fact that I saw those coveted lavender fields was amazing, but Zach’s being there with me made the trip magical. He was so sweet. If I didn’t know better, I’d think he were courting me. More than once I caught him staring. He’d quickly look away or say something funny. The first few times I thought it had just been my wishful thinking.

But then he held me longer than was necessary to help me onto the trike. When he finally let go, he didn’t just take his strong hands off me—"
B079LF1PDH2,B079LF1PDH,"And I’m sure I will be as soon as I get over that lustful thing I feel for Zach.

There are a gazillion excellent reasons why I should.

Zach is my employer. He’s Noah’s teammate and friend. Unlike Noah who speaks Nepali better than I speak French, Zach has never been to my country and knows nothing about my culture. He’s a divorced single dad, whom my parents would never approve of.

And, as if all of that wasn’t enough, he’s interested in another woman— Noah’s foxy landlady Sophie. He’s about to take her out on a date.

The reason I know this is because he’s asked me to babysit Sam when he does.

THREE

Zach

The whole idea of Uma joining Sam and me for our weekly swimming pool session had nothing to do with me wanting to see her legs.

Nothing at all.

At home, both Uma’s and my bedrooms have an en suite bathroom. Uma always comes down to breakfast fully dressed. Respectful of her modesty, I do the same. Once or twice, I’ve bumped into her late at night in the second-floor hallway, both of us rushing to Sam’s room because he made a suspicious sound. She wore an oversized long-sleeved T-shirt and pajama pants."
B079LF1PDH3,B079LF1PDH,"Just like the women in the movie, I would embroider for an haute couture house.

After school, I told Aama and Baba about my newfound calling and begged them to buy me some supplies—the cheapest ones, anything they could afford. They did, bless their kind hearts. They were quite happy with the embroidery part of my dream. They still are.

Unlike driving a bus or tightrope dancing—my dreams as a kid —embroidery is a perfectly respectable and safe occupation for a young Hindu woman.

It’s the haute couture part with all its unsavory implications that bothers my parents. Working on indecent gowns that reveal too much skin. Being involved—even remotely—with worldly designers, indecorous models, debauched fashion photographers, and decadent runway shows.

Not that I’ve had a chance to do any of it yet.

Before I enrolled in Ecole Lesage and came to Paris to do the training and get my certificate —all thanks to a grant from Marguerite’s foundation— I had done quite a bit of stitching for a big sari outfitter in Kathmandu. It was fun, but there was no wiggle room. I was required to stick to the traditional styles and use the patterns I was given. At night, I traced my own patterns. Except, I never had time to embroider them."
B00EGJ32A60,B00EGJ32A6,"If you walked along the beach, riddled through with the holes of fiddler crabs, you would sometimes look out to see one of the giant reptiles, for they, too, had adapted to their habitat.

I understood why no one lived in Area X now, that it was pristine because of that reason, but I kept un-remembering it. I had decided instead to make believe that it was simply a protected wildlife refuge, and we were hikers who happened to be scientists. This made sense on another level: We did not know what had happened here, what was still happening here, and any preformed theories would affect my analysis of the evidence as we encountered it. Besides, for my part it hardly mattered what lies I told myself because my existence back in the world had become at least as empty as Area X. With nothing left to anchor me, I needed to be here. As for the others, I don’t know what they told themselves, and I didn’t want to know, but I believe they all at least pretended to some level of curiosity. Curiosity could be a powerful distraction.

That night we talked about the tower, although the other three insisted on calling it a tunnel. The responsibility for the thrust of our investigations resided with each individual, the psychologist’s authority describing a wider circle around these decisions."
B00EGJ32A61,B00EGJ32A6,"Our cameras required a makeshift darkroom. The absence of cell phones in particular made the real world seem very far away to the others, but I had always preferred to live without them. For weapons, we had knives, a locked container of antique handguns, and one assault rifle, this last a reluctant concession to current security standards.

It was expected simply that we would keep a record, like this one, in a journal, like this one: lightweight but nearly indestructible, with waterproof paper, a flexible black-and-white cover, and the blue horizontal lines for writing and the red line to the left to mark the margin. These journals would either return with us or be recovered by the next expedition. We had been cautioned to provide maximum context, so that anyone ignorant of Area X could understand our accounts. We had also been ordered not to share our journal entries with one another. Too much shared information could skew our observations, our superiors believed. But I knew from experience how hopeless this pursuit, this attempt to weed out bias, was. Nothing that lived and breathed was truly objective—even in a vacuum, even if all that possessed the brain was a self-immolating desire for the truth."
B00EGJ32A62,B00EGJ32A6,"It measured roughly sixty feet in diameter, this circular block, and was raised from ground level by about eight inches. Nothing had been etched into or written on its surface that could in any way reveal its purpose or the identity of its makers. Starting at due north, a rectangular opening set into the surface of the block revealed stairs spiraling down into darkness. The entrance was obscured by the webs of banana spiders and debris from storms, but a cool draft came from below.

At first, only I saw it as a tower. I don’t know why the word tower came to me, given that it tunneled into the ground. I could as easily have considered it a bunker or a submerged building. Yet as soon as I saw the staircase, I remembered the lighthouse on the coast and had a sudden vision of the last expedition drifting off, one by one, and sometime thereafter the ground shifting in a uniform and preplanned way to leave the lighthouse standing where it had always been but depositing this underground part of it inland. I saw this in vast and intricate detail as we all stood there, and, looking back, I mark it as the first irrational thought I had once we had reached our destination."
B00EGJ32A63,B00EGJ32A6,"This water was so dark we could see our faces in it, and it never stirred, set like glass, reflecting the beards of gray moss that smothered the cypress trees. If you looked out through these areas, toward the ocean, all you saw was the black water, the gray of the cypress trunks, and the constant, motionless rain of moss flowing down. All you heard was the low moaning. The effect of this cannot be understood without being there. The beauty of it cannot be understood, either, and when you see beauty in desolation it changes something inside you. Desolation tries to colonize you.

As noted, we found the tower in a place just before the forest became waterlogged and then turned to salt marsh. This occurred on our fourth day after reaching base camp, by which time we had almost gotten our bearings. We did not expect to find anything there, based on both the maps that we brought with us and the water-stained, pine-dust-smeared documents our predecessors had left behind. But there it was, surrounded by a fringe of scrub grass, half-hidden by fallen moss off to the left of the trail: a circular block of some grayish stone seeming to mix cement and ground-up seashells."
B01JZXZCNW0,B01JZXZCNW,"Why did I have the distinct feeling that the city of Snow Creek was paying me to do someone else’s dirty work?

I left right at five o’clock, my eyes crossing from all the numbers. One more folder to look at, but it would wait until tomorrow. A whole day’s work, and all I had learned was that the Steels were loaded. That they’d always been loaded.

I stopped at Rita’s again, got a sandwich to go, and headed down the street to my hotel. Living in a small town was great. Everything was within walking distance. I might not like it when winter came, but right now was perfect. By winter, maybe I’d have saved up enough for a car.

Up in my room, I shed my work attire, washed the makeup off my face, and got into a pair of cutoffs and a David Bowie T-shirt. I hadn’t brought the extra file home as I normally would have. I really needed a break from those numbers. I grabbed a bottle of water out of my mini fridge and sat down on the bed to eat my sandwich.

Midway through my first bite, a knock sounded on the door."
B01JZXZCNW1,B01JZXZCNW,"My eyes were bugging out from looking at all the numbers.

I felt like I was working at cross purposes. I both did and didn’t want to find something. I certainly didn’t want to find out that the Steels were involved in anything illegal, but I did want to find anything that might help me uncover the secret that Talon was keeping and that Jonah and Ryan were helping him keep. These bank accounts did nothing to help me figure out why the marriage certificate and name certificate had been changed.

I doubted any of their money was dirty, at least not the current Steel money. I had witnessed how hard both Jonah and Ryan worked at the ranch. Talon too, when he was out at the orchards. He knew his stuff, and I couldn’t wait until the Fuji apples were ready. And the peaches… Colorado Western slope peaches… Nothing better.

More bank statements in the next folder. Had Larry only given me bank accounts?

At one o’clock, I took a quick break to walk over to Rita’s Café and have some spinach quiche, and then I got straight back to work.

At about two thirty, Larry walked into my office."
B01JZXZCNW2,B01JZXZCNW,"If he had that kind of authority, he certainly didn’t need me to do his investigating for him.

I couldn’t imagine who might have that authority and who the Steels—or possibly someone else—could’ve gotten to make the changes. Or why they wanted the changes made anyway.

I made quick copies of both documents to show Marj later. Then I opened the first folder on the stack Larry had given me.

It was full of bank-account records from the Cayman Islands. Criminals often kept their money in Cayman banks due to the bank secrecy laws and reduced taxation. Those were also perfectly good reasons for anyone with a lot of money to bank there…and the Steels did have a lot of money. More so than I could’ve even imagined, as I cruised through these bank accounts.

There were bank accounts in all of the Steels’ names and many in names I assumed were dummy corporations set up to move funds around. Still, I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. The Steels had money. That was certainly no crime. And just because they banked in the Caymans didn’t automatically mean their money was dirty.

The next two folders contained more bank accounts, some of which were hopelessly outdated."
B01JZXZCNW3,B01JZXZCNW,"I typed in Steel, Bradford and Wade, Daphne.

Nothing.

My skin chilled. I had seen the original marriage certificate with my own eyes, and it was between Bradford Raymond Steel and Daphne Kay Wade.

I got my bearings and typed in Steel, Bradford and Warren, Daphne.

Bingo. Everything else on the certificate was the same—their birth dates, the date of the marriage, the signatures…

My heart did a jump. Was the marriage certificate that Marjorie and I found a forgery? Or had someone gotten into the Colorado database and changed Daphne’s name?

Next I accessed records of birth. I pulled up Jonah’s, Ryan’s, and Talon’s. All were identical to the copies we’d found in the Steels’ basement. I inhaled and typed in Angela Marjorie Steel.

No record.

I typed in Marjorie Steel.

Bingo again. Marj’s birth certificate popped up, minus her unknown first name.

Why would anyone change these? Again, I wondered if the documents we found were forgeries or whether someone had accessed the Colorado database. That would not be an easy thing to do.

Unless one was a city attorney maybe? I shook my head, erasing the thought. Larry had the same access to the files that I did. He didn’t have authority to change them."
B0010SKUYM0,B0010SKUYM,"After two hours of fumbling through the dark, Chronicler saw light flickering through the trees and abandoned any thought of making it to Newarre that night, deciding a farmstead’s hospitality would be welcome enough.

He left the road, blundering through the trees toward the light. But the fire was farther away than he had thought, and larger. It wasn’t lamplight from a house, or even sparks from a campfire. It was a bonfire roaring in the ruins of an old house, little more than two crumbling stone walls. Huddled into the corner those two walls made was a man. He wore a heavy hooded cloak, bundled up as if it were full winter and not a mild autumn evening.

Chronicler’s hopes rose at the sight of a small cook fire with a pot hanging over it. But as he came close, he caught a foul scent mingling with the woodsmoke. It reeked of burning hair and rotting flowers. Chronicler quickly decided that whatever the man was cooking in the iron pot, he wanted none of it. Still, even a place next to a fire was better than curling up by the side of the road.

Chronicler stepped into the circle of firelight."
B0010SKUYM1,B0010SKUYM,"There were no customers. When evening finally came he lit the lamps and began to page disinterestedly through a book.

Fall was supposed to be the year’s busiest time, but travelers were scarce lately. Kote knew with bleak certainty how long winter would be.

He closed the inn early, something he had never done before. He didn’t bother sweeping. The floor didn’t need it. He didn’t wash the tables or the bar, none had been used. He polished a bottle or two, locked the door, and went to bed.

There was no one around to notice the difference. No one except Bast, who watched his master, and worried, and waited.

CHAPTER FOUR

Halfway to Newarre

CHRONICLER WALKED. Yesterday he had limped, but today there was no part of his feet that didn’t hurt, so limping did no good. He had searched for horses in Abbot’s Ford and Rannish, offering outrageous prices for even the most broken-down animals. But in small towns like these, people didn’t have horses to spare, especially not with harvest fast approaching.

Despite a hard day’s walking, he was still on the road when night fell, making the rutted dirt road a stumbling ground of half-seen shapes."
B0010SKUYM2,B0010SKUYM,"As he was undressing for bed, the fire flared. The red light traced faint lines across his body, across his back and arms. All the scars were smooth and silver, streaking him like lightning, like lines of gentle remembering. The flare of flame revealed them all briefly, old wounds and new. All the scars were smooth and silver except one.

The fire flickered and died. Sleep met him like a lover in an empty bed.

The travelers left early the next morning. Bast tended to their needs, explaining his master’s knee was swollen quite badly and he didn’t feel up to taking the stairs so early in the day. Everyone understood except for the sandy-haired merchant’s son, who was too groggy to understand much of anything. The guards exchanged smiles and rolled their eyes while the tinker gave an impromptu sermon on the subject of temperance. Bast recommended several unpleasant hangover cures.

After they left, Bast tended to the inn, which was no great chore, as there were no customers. Most of his time was spent trying to find ways to amuse himself.

Some time after noon, Kote came down the stairs to find him crushing walnuts on the bar with a heavy leather-bound book."
B0010SKUYM3,B0010SKUYM,"It is hard to say what troubled Bast so much. Kote didn’t seem noticeably changed in any way. Except, perhaps, that he moved a little slower, and whatever small spark the night’s activity had lit behind his eyes was dimmer now. In fact, it could hardly be seen. In fact, it may not have been there at all.

Kote sat in front of the fire and ate his meal mechanically, as if he were simply finding a place inside himself to keep the food. After the last bite he sat staring into nothing, not remembering what he had eaten or what it tasted like.

The fire snapped, making him blink and look around the room. He looked down at his hands, one curled inside the other, resting in his lap. After a moment, he lifted and spread them, as if warming them by the fire. They were graceful, with long, delicate fingers. He watched them intently, as if expecting them to do something on their own. Then he lowered them to his lap, one hand lightly cupping the other, and returned to watching the fire. Expressionless, motionless, he sat until there was nothing left but grey ash and dully glowing coals."
B06ZYFQYYK0,B06ZYFQYYK,"He powered up the recording from the restaurant, the conversation between the men spit out at the bottom of the screen by the software package, looking like closed captioning at a sports bar. He saw that Alex was correct. The men were discussing weapons, strategy, and money. The deputy prime minister of Lesotho, Makalo Lenatha, was mentioned, then the black man spoke, and Aaron finally had a name: Lieutenant General Jonathan Mosebo, head of the Lesotho Defence Force.

The readout continued, and he learned that the general was being unceremoniously fired by the prime minister and was none too pleased about it. The other Caucasian, a man called Johan, calmed him down, and the talk continued along nebulous lines about force structures and loyalties.

Nothing to do with diamonds. What the hell?

The phone call came, the target answering, and he fast-forwarded through Alex’s short walk down the stairs. When she appeared by the target’s table, he slowed the video down again, and the scrolling sentences at the bottom turned into gibberish. Confused, he punched a couple of icons on the software package, then realized what the problem was: The man wasn’t speaking English.

He’s speaking Hebrew.

Aaron glanced up from the tablet and saw that a single streetlight had come on, providing enough feeble illumination to potentially compromise them."
B06ZYFQYYK1,B06ZYFQYYK,"With him it was hard to tell, but if someone took it as a challenge, they’d be sorely wishing they hadn’t. Unlike a lot of the posers at the convention, he was most definitely an Operator.

While the trip was a little bit of a boondoggle, we did have a specific mission. We’d just come from a booth manned by a company called ZEV Technologies—a maker of high-end aftermarket components and custom frame/slide work for Glock pistols—and had sealed a deal to test some pistols for our specific applications.

Although we already had our own armorer support that we used to hone our combat weapons, Kurt Hale — the commander of the Taskforce—was wondering if we weren’t just reinventing the wheel and wanted to see if it would be better to simply farm out the work. After talking to ZEV, I was beginning to believe he was right, only our wheels were something from a Conestoga wagon while ZEV was racing around on run-flats.

We pushed through the crowd and entered the cavernous Venetian casino, working our way to Las Vegas Boulevard. We exited into the sunshine, leaving the commandos and gamblers, only to be hit by Guatemalan refugees trying to hand me cards with hookers offering their services. One of the strangest things about Vegas."
B06ZYFQYYK2,B06ZYFQYYK,"In the world of the Taskforce, when we were out in the badlands earning our ISIS Hunter patches for real, he was a civilian employee of my company, but if another SEAL from his past saw him here, they’d know that was bullshit, so we’d created a story that was plausible should that happen to either of us.

It was my first trip to the fabled SHOT Show in Las Vegas, the largest gun show on earth, and the interior of the Sands Convention Center was literally stuffed with booth after booth selling various weapons, accessories, and outdoor gear. It was Mecca to people like me, and the Taskforce sent a contingent every year to prowl the halls looking for anything new that we could incorporate into our mission set. Back when I was on active duty, as the team leader, I’d always let a junior member of the team make the trip, and Knuckles, my 2IC, had been a few times before.

Given how he was dressed, I was surprised they let him in.

In contrast to the bearded ones, he looked like he had come to protest the convention, with his long hippie hair, Che Guevara T-shirt, and lack of any tacti-cool paraphernalia. He was even wearing a leather necklace with a bronze peace sign the size of a fifty-cent piece—either as irony or as a challenge."
B06ZYFQYYK3,B06ZYFQYYK,"She did, sidling between the throngs of tour bus patrons and locals, threading between the tables and down the stairs, the picture on Aaron’s tablet jumping left and right. She reached the patio and it stabilized. She walked toward the restrooms, then stopped at the table, asking directions. He recorded about a fifteen-second snippet of the phone conversation, unsure if the software would be able to utilize the footage because the target’s face was partially obscured by his smartphone.

He glanced over the balcony to see the interaction, and she broke contact, doing a passable job of being a tourist. He saw no outward interest in the interruption.

Aaron ignored the rest of the feed, wondering if Alex would be smart enough to cut it off if she really chose to use the bathroom. She did. Or maybe the Bluetooth simply lost contact because of distance. He grinned and took a sip of his beer, surreptitiously giving the target table a side-eye.

The Israeli was asking a waitress for the check. Aaron immediately picked up his phone and called Alex, telling her to return.

The men tossed some rand on the table, preparing to leave, and he saw her coming across the patio."

Richard Sanders owned the Bellissimo. He bought it from his father-in-law, Salvatore Casimiro. Mr. Sanders was at times happily, and at other times, unhappily, married to Casimiro’s only daughter, Bianca. My doppelganger. Our coloring was off: I have red hair, more caramel than red, and eyes about the same color, while she’s honey blonde, with pistachio green eyes. But we were the same height, build, and weight, with alarmingly similar features, and with one can of B Blonde, which I bought by the case at Walgreens, plus tinted contact lenses, only our husbands could tell us apart. I’d been Bianca’s celebrity double since I walked through the Bellissimo doors, and I was good at it. Bianca was addicted to it. So addicted, she rarely went out. Which meant very little interaction with humans past her staff, who she didn’t even acknowledge as human, and that left me: I was her human. And she thought I was her staff. Not only did I represent her to the outside world, I was her only link to it. To beat it all, she fully believed my name was David. I hadn’t managed, in five long years, to convince her otherwise."
B078WHLR711,B078WHLR71,"my own sister—for me to rush, trip, and possibly fall. I had too many questions. First, was Gully really on his way to Mexico with Meredith? I believed he had her, but for all I knew he had her across the street. I needed to find him. If I found Gully, I’d find my sister. Second, why did he need so much money? Because Gully had a million-dollar problem. If I knew what it was, maybe I could help find a solution other than grand larceny, with me being the grand larcenist. Third, I needed to level the playing field. As it stood, Gully held all the cards.

Typically, my first move would be to gather my team. Four heads, you know.

I couldn’t, because I couldn’t tell them.

I couldn’t tell them before I told Bradley.

(Marriage, you know? I had a good one and wanted to keep it that way.)

I couldn’t go to the police. What would I say? A preacher kidnapped my sister and a witch wants me to steal a million dollars?

I couldn’t, and wouldn’t if I could, tell my parents. My father survived one heart attack. I wasn’t about to give him another.

And that left… Vree?"
B078WHLR712,B078WHLR71,"Before Bradley was president and CEO of the Bellissimo, he was an attorney. He saw things in black and white, including kidnapping and extortion. He’d have the FBI and their international counterparts here in five minutes.

I was a spy. Spies don’t call the feds until they have their man.

Or preacher.

Or witch.

Five years ago, I joined an elite internal security team at the Bellissimo. After a nice long maternity leave when Bex and Quinn were born, I’d recently returned to work, in a part-time job-share capacity with my best friend, Fantasy Erb. We reported to the head of security, Jeremy Covey, and we had a fourth on our team, Baylor. Just Baylor. He was mononymous. Like Beyoncé. And Snoopy. Before I took the Bellissimo position, I was a police officer for seven years in Pine Apple. Given my background, very different from my husband’s, I saw every shade of gray. Bradley went straight from A to Z. I meandered, often getting stuck around G, shot at near M, without a hope by T, but somehow pulled it together by Z.

I wasn’t sure what I was dealing with, and I wasn’t going to drag Bradley into it until I was. Too much was at stake—"
B078WHLR713,B078WHLR71,"Heed his message: I was put on this earth to show men the way, the truth, and the light. If word of this were to get out, my work for the Almighty would be finished. To ensure you and Sister Loose Lips don’t destroy my holy mission, I am sending a disciple to be my eyes, ears, and courier. If you or Vreeland Howard speak one word to one person, I will know, and I will leave your sister in the middle of Mexico with nothing but the clothes on her back. The dog too. You’re a child of God, Davis. Do his will. Do it swiftly, stealthily, and in secret, so that you may soon be reunited with your loved one. God be with you.

I pushed the phone to Vree.

She read the email, then the phone dropped out of her hands.

She didn’t say a word.

I hadn’t begun to process what I’d just read and Vree was in a mute paralytic trance when my phone rang. It was Security. Calling to say I had another visitor on the way up. I don’t remember running to the front door. I do remember almost tearing it off the hinges, praying it would be my sister, but there stood Aunt Bootsy.

The witch."
B07BLJYCY30,B07BLJYCY3,"She cuts it off so she won’t start crying.

She stirs a little then, the pang of pain in her head not so bad as it was last time. Moving her feet, it occurs to her how cold they are.

Tiles the color of brick etch a grid into the floor. The little gray seams of grout dividing everything up into boxes. Into cells.

Appropriate, she thinks. This is her cell.

Again she rattles her cuffs against the bar. Makes the desk hop up and down a little, metal feet scratching at the tile with angry squawks.

But her headache flares back into blinding territory, and she gives it up.

Rest. For now, she will rest.

She will save her strength for the fight ahead.

* * *

Emily thinks of Gabby as she drifts, her thoughts half-conscious and half-dream. Somewhere in between and both at once.

Images of her friend flicker in her head. Silent movies. Slices of life where little happens.

Coils of dark hair bunch at each side of Gabby’s face. The cigarette perpetually dangles from her lip. She smiles. She smokes. She looks bored. The background shifts and morphs along with her expressions — rooms and cityscapes taking shape behind her in pulses."
B07BLJYCY31,B07BLJYCY3,"Probably in the middle of nowhere. Somewhere up in the mountains, away from the city.

Thick bands of what looks like stucco surround the dark planks of wood that comprise the structure, striping the wall in light and dark. The messy edges where the white touches the lumber looks like foamy toothpaste in the half-light.

It’s dark. Is it still night? She’s not sure.

Gray shadows fall over the floors, climb up the walls, collect into clouds of black in every corner.

A single burning bulb in a track lighting fixture provides what little light there is, all of it angled away from her. A circle glowing on the far wall.

Boards block out every window. Heavy wood. Nailed or screwed in tightly. She couldn’t remove it without tools and time.

That leaves the heavy steel door off to her right as the only way out. A blue-gray thing that offers little hope of escape. The metal looks out of place among all the wood. Probably added by him. The finishing touch to complete his dream torture chamber. Really ties the room together.

A silent laugh emits from her nostrils, more injured than joyous. The sardonic thought is too scary to be funny."
B07BLJYCY32,B07BLJYCY3,"At first, she is only conscious that she is alone, at least in terms of her immediate surroundings.

This room is empty of other life. He isn’t here.

With that settled, the details of her surroundings begin to filter into her awareness.

A new feeling at her wrists has replaced the bite of the plastic zip ties.

Handcuffs.

They attach her to what looks like a typical school desk, the kind with the desktop and chair built as one piece. The chain of the cuffs is looped around one of the steel support bars under the laminated wood tabletop.

She jerks her arms a few times, metal rattling against metal, before all of this fully registers.

She’s trapped.

She takes a few breaths. Concentrates to keep the churning panic from taking over.

She needs to focus on the room around her. Needs to learn it. Needs to find a way out.

She finds herself in a great room almost barren of furniture. Almost. There are four more desks similar to hers, the others shoved into the corner behind her.

A cast iron stove mans the center of the wall across the room. Between that and all the wood showing, all the rustic details, she knows it must be a cabin."
B07BLJYCY33,B07BLJYCY3,"Like all those times as a kid she was sure she was bleeding but the fingers checking the point of impact came away clean.

Not today. This time there’s blood.

She tastes it at the corner of her lip. It’s caked there along the left side of her mouth. Crusty and dry.

She probes with her tongue. Investigates. No wounds that she can find.

The red must have drained down from the dome of her skull. The point where the steel made impact. Blinking a few times she can feel where the dried blood pulls her eyelid taut as well.

She opens her eyes wide. Sits up a little. Another stab of hurt jabs at her temple as soon as she moves. Pain so sharp it wobbles her reality. Shuts her eyes for her. Almost pulls her back into unconsciousness.

She takes deep breaths. Endures it. Watches everything go darker and fade back to bright again. Conscious of little but her breathing and the awful throb in her skull.

The pain makes it hard to think. Hard to open her eyes. Hard to exist at all.

She waits a time like that. Just breathing. Chin tucked almost to her sternum. And then she opens her eyes again. Careful not to move at all."
B01H0825PW0,B01H0825PW,"She had never seen her father eat with his hands, but copied his gestures as he took the meat served on a pancake of purple maize. He ate as delicately as if dining on silver plate at the head of the table in Albany, enjoying a terrine of smoked grouse. Eliza munched through three delicious cakes before she struck grit in the ground corn.

She winced, and pushed the crumbled stone to the side of her mouth. How could she take it out politely? The men were engrossed in food and conversation, and her father was trying to explain the recent deaths in Boston where British troops had fired upon a threatening crowd. Eliza contemplated keeping the grit in her cheek for the next few hours.

She felt eyes on her. Across the room, an Indian youth of medium build sat cross-legged. Unlike many of the others, his sleek hair was tied back instead of shaved. He wore the feathers of a Mohawk and gazed at her forthrightly. Eliza knew she ought to drop her eyes, but returned the stare.

His dark, almond-shaped eyes were neither friendly nor hostile, just intent and observant. Eliza wondered if they looked like her own."
B01H0825PW1,B01H0825PW,"The Indian leader, whose face was lined and grave, accepted the gift with a nod and another polite speech.

Eliza wondered why her father spoke so diffidently. Silk ribbon came all the way from Manhattan and they never had enough of it, not with four daughters in the house. And tobacco was currency—as valuable as British pounds, which were rarer than roosters’ eggs ever since trade between the colonies and Britain had stopped.

Philip Schuyler gave his daughter his arm. They proceeded into the longhouse. Eliza burned to examine the castle but knew better than to stare like a simpleton, so she looked around as if taking care not to stumble. The shadowy interior smelled of wood smoke and roasting meat. Shelves burdened with gourds and lidded baskets lined the walls, and ears of drying maize tied by their silks hung from the rafters. Groups of men lounged on rugs, some made from bearskin, others from cloth. The translator showed them to a bench facing a low table made from a single plank. Thank goodness, Eliza thought, since she hadn’t the faintest idea how to sit on a bearskin with the dignity she knew her father expected.

The appetizing smells of corn and venison reminded Eliza that she had skipped breakfast."
B01H0825PW2,B01H0825PW,"The fields on either side of the carriage weren’t very different from theirs. Rows of corn and oats looked well tended, and neat paths divided what might have been family parcels. Only the absence of fences was distinctive. The Six Nations didn’t believe in owning cattle since deer were so plentiful, Papa once told her, so had no need to guard against wandering bovines.

Eliza at last spied the village on a gentle hill overlooking the river. Stout tree trunks sharpened into spikes walled the large village. A warrior on a watchtower gazed over a spiky rampart at their carriage and beckoned them through the tall gateway. The calash finally wheeled to a stop in front of a brown-bark longhouse that was not much of a castle, to Eliza’s disappointment, though it was larger than the biggest church in Albany. A double row of smaller longhouses stretched along either side.

Her left foot had grown numb during the ride, and Eliza shook it under the heavy blankets to dispel the tingling. She didn’t want to stumble in front of the Indian children now gathering with bright-eyed attention under the watchful eye of a young, copper-skinned girl about her own age."
B01H0825PW3,B01H0825PW,"Popinjay, the bluebird she had snatched from the house cat, still visited Eliza’s windowsill for bread crumbs every morning. Tame or wild, all the animals she knew on the farm were far from dumb, though that’s what ignorant, unimaginative people called them.

The only boy who had ever caught her attention — and kept it more than a minute —was the Mohawk she met the day that Father yielded to her pleas to accompany him to the meeting of the Six Nations after she vowed to be quiet the entire visit and promised never to bring snakes into the house again. It thrilled Eliza to persuade Papa and reinforced her feeling that if there was one thing she knew about herself, it was that she was convincing.

What she didn’t understand was why she couldn’t forget the impetuous, reckless boy with the strong hands and fierce eyes.

The other Schuyler children were still asleep when she and Papa left that morning—except little Cornelia, who chewed on her braid and told Eliza that she would go, too, when she was grown-up. Outside, the slaves had already stoked the fire at the smithy, and the gristmill and sawmills were humming. The doorway was dim, so Eliza couldn’t see the disapproving expression on Diana’s African face."
B00G3L6KQI0,B00G3L6KQI,"With the exception of the shiny silver laptop on the desk where the blotter used to be, the room looked exactly as it had on the day Philippe de Clermont died in 1945. The same Bakelite telephone was on a table by the window. Stacks of thin envelopes and curling, yellowed paper stood at the ready for Philippe to write to one of his many correspondents. Tacked to the wall was an old map of Europe, which Philippe had used to track the positions of Hitler’s army.

Matthew closed his eyes against the sudden, sharp pain. What Philippe had not foreseen was that he would fall into the Nazis’ hands. One of the unexpected gifts of their timewalk had been the chance to see Philippe again and be reconciled with him. The price Matthew had to pay was the renewed sense of loss as he once more faced a world without Philippe de Clermont in it.

When Matthew’s eyes opened again, he was confronted with the furious face of Phoebe Taylor. It took only a fraction of a second for Marcus to angle his body between Matthew and the warmblooded woman. Matthew was gratified to see that his son hadn’t lost all his wits when he took a mate, though if Matthew had wanted to harm Phoebe, the girl would already be dead."
B00G3L6KQI1,B00G3L6KQI,"Diana had begun the lifelong process of growing into her powers as a witch. They’d even taken in two orphaned children and given them a chance at a better future. Their life in the sixteenth century had not always been easy, but their days had been filled with love and the sense of hope that followed Diana wherever she went. Here at Sept-Tours, they seemed surrounded on all sides by death and de Clermonts.

The combination made Matthew restless, and the anger he kept so carefully in check whenever Diana was near him was dangerously close to the surface. Blood rage—the sickness that Matthew had inherited from Ysabeau when she’d made him—could take over a vampire’s mind and body quickly, leaving no room for reason or control. In an effort to keep the blood rage in check, Matthew had reluctantly agreed to leave Diana in Ysabeau’s care while he walked around the castle grounds with his dogs, Fallon and Hector, trying to clear his head.

Gallowglass was crooning a sea chantey in the château ’s great hall. For reasons Matthew couldn’t fathom, every other verse was punctuated by expletives and ultimatums. After a moment of indecision, Matthew’s curiosity won out."
B00G3L6KQI2,B00G3L6KQI,"Matthew raced down the curving stone staircase that wound between his tower rooms at Sept-Tours and the main floor of the château. He avoided the slippery spot on the thirtieth tread and the rough patch on the seventeenth where Baldwin’s sword had bashed the edge during one of their arguments.

Matthew had built the tower addition as his private refuge, a place apart from the relentless busyness that always surrounded Philippe and Ysabeau. Vampire families were large and noisy, with two or more bloodlines coming uncomfortably together and trying to live as one happy pack. This seldom happened with predators, even those who walked on two legs and lived in fine houses. As a result, Matthew’s tower was designed primarily for defense. It had no doors to muffle a vampire’s stealthy approach and no way out except for the way you came in. His careful arrangements spoke volumes about his relationships with his brothers and sisters.

Tonight his tower’s isolation seemed confining, a far cry from the busy life he and Diana had created in Elizabethan London, surrounded by family and friends. Matthew’s job as a spy for the queen had been challenging but rewarding. From his former seat on the Congregation, he had managed to save a few witches from hanging."
B00G3L6KQI3,B00G3L6KQI,"Matthew’s hair was shorter, and he had a beard that made him look even more dangerous, like a pirate. She gasped.

Is Matthew . . . bigger?

He is. I fattened him up when he and Diana were here in 1590. Books were making him soft. Matthew needed to fight more and read less. Philippe had always contended there was such a thing as too much education. Matthew was living proof of it.

Diana looks different, too. More like her mother, with that long, coppery hair, Em said, acknowledging the most obvious change in her niece.

Diana stumbled on a cobblestone, and Matthew’s hand shot out to steady her. Once, Emily had seen Matthew’s incessant hovering as a sign of vampire overprotectiveness. Now, with the perspicacity of a ghost, she realized that this tendency stemmed from his preternatural awareness of every change in Diana’s expression, every shift of mood, every sign of fatigue or hunger. Today, however, Matthew’s concern seemed even more focused and acute.

It’s not just Diana’s hair that has changed. Philippe’s face had a look of wonder. Diana is with child— Matthew’s child.

Emily examined her niece more carefully, using the enhanced grasp of truth that death afforded. Philippe was right—in part."
B01BD1SUBU0,B01BD1SUBU,"How would it look if she pulled away? She can smell that he’s been drinking.

Anne now blames herself. It’s her fault. She wants to blame Marco, but she agreed to leave the baby alone. She should have stayed home. No —she should have brought Cora with them next door, to hell with Cynthia. She doubts Cynthia would have actually thrown them out and had no party for Graham at all. This realization comes too late.

They will be judged, by the police and by everybody else. Serves them right, leaving their baby alone. She would think that, too, if it had happened to someone else. She knows how judgmental mothers are, how good it feels to sit in judgment of someone else. She thinks of her own mothers’ group, meeting with their babies once a week in one another’s homes for coffee and gossip, what they will say about her.

Someone else has arrived—a composed man in a well-cut dark suit. The uniformed officers treat him with deference. Anne looks up, meets his piercing blue eyes, and wonders who he is.

He approaches and sits down in one of the armchairs across from Anne and Marco and introduces himself as Detective Rasbach. Then he leans forward."
B01BD1SUBU1,B01BD1SUBU,"Someone has placed a blanket around her shoulders, but she’s still trembling. She is in shock. Police cars are parked on the street outside the house, their red lights flashing, pulsing through the front window and circling the pale walls. Anne sits immobile on the sofa and stares ahead as if hypnotized by them.

Marco, his voice breaking, has given the police a quick description of the baby—six months old, blond, blue eyes, about sixteen pounds, wearing a disposable diaper and a plain, pale pink onesie. A light summer baby blanket, solid white, is also missing from the crib.

The house is swarming with uniformed police officers. They fan out and methodically begin to search the house. Some of them wear latex gloves and carry evidence kits. Anne and Marco’s fast, frantic race through the house in the short minutes before the police arrived had turned up nothing. The forensic team is moving slowly. Clearly they are not looking for Cora; they are looking for evidence. The baby is already gone.

Marco sits down on the sofa next to Anne and puts his arm around her, holds her close. She wants to pull away, but she doesn’t. She lets his arm stay there."
B01BD1SUBU2,B01BD1SUBU,"Marco doesn’t move. Anne looks up at him. He is paralyzed, in shock, staring at the empty crib, as if he can’t believe it. Anne sees the fear and guilt in his eyes and starts to wail—a horrible, keening sound, like an animal in pain.

Marco still doesn’t budge. Anne bolts across the hall to their bedroom, grabs the phone off the bedside table, and dials 911, her hands shaking, getting vomit all over the phone. Marco finally snaps out of it. She can hear him walking rapidly around the second floor of the house while she stares across the hall at the empty crib. He checks the bathroom, at the top of the stairs, then passes quickly by her on his way to search the spare bedroom and then the last room down the hall, the one they have turned into an office. But even as he does, Anne wonders in a detached way why he is looking there. It’s as if part of her mind has split off and is thinking logically. It’s not like their baby is mobile on her own. She is not in the bathroom, or the spare bedroom, or the office.

Someone has taken her."
B01BD1SUBU3,B01BD1SUBU,"Who goes to a dinner party next door and leaves her baby alone in the house? What kind of mother does such a thing? She feels the familiar agony set in—she is not a good mother.

So what if the sitter canceled? They should have brought Cora with them, put her in her portable playpen. But Cynthia had said no children. It was to be an adult evening, for Graham’s birthday. Which is another reason Anne has come to dislike Cynthia, who was once a good friend — Cynthia is not baby-friendly. Who says that a six-month-old baby isn’t welcome at a dinner party? How had Anne ever let Marco persuade her that it was okay? It was irresponsible. She wonders what the other mothers in her moms’ group would think if she ever told them. We left our six-month-old baby home alone and went to a party next door. She imagines all their jaws dropping in shock, the uncomfortable silence. But she will never tell them. She’d be shunned.

She and Marco had argued about it before the party. When the sitter called and canceled, Anne had offered to stay home with the baby— she hadn’t wanted to go to the dinner anyway. But Marco was having none of it."
B0024CEY360,B0024CEY36,"Above the second floor was an irrational collection of towers, turrets and attics. The whole facade was a riot of ornamental stonework in the best Victorian rococo manner, with flowers and chevrons and sculpted coils of rope, dragons and lions and cherubim, balconies and battlements, flagpoles and sundials and gargoyles. Lydia loved the place, and she was grateful that Stephen—unlike many of the old aristocracy—could afford to keep it up.

She saw Charlotte and Belinda emerge from the shrubbery across the lawn. Annie had not found them, of course. They both wore wide-brimmed hats and summer frocks with schoolgirls’ black stockings and low black shoes. Because Charlotte was coming out this season, she was occasionally permitted to put up her hair and dress for dinner, but most of the time Lydia treated her like the child she was, for it was bad for children to grow up too fast. The two cousins were deep in conversation, and Lydia wondered idly what they were talking about. What was on my mind when I was eighteen? she asked herself; and then she remembered a young man with soft hair and clever hands, and she thought: Please, God, let me keep my secrets."
B0024CEY361,B0024CEY36,"Lydia had never met the old man, for he had died before she knew Stephen, but by all accounts he had been one of the great larger-than-life Victorians. His bushes were now in full glorious bloom and made a rather un-Victorian blaze of assorted colors. We must have somebody paint a picture of the house, she thought; the last one was done before the park was mature.

She looked back at Walden Hall. The gray stone of the south front looked beautiful and dignified in the afternoon sunshine. In the center was the south door. The farther, east wing contained the drawing room and various dining rooms, and behind them a straggle of kitchens, pantries and laundries running higgledy-piggledy to the distant stables. Nearer to her, on the west side, were the morning room, the Octagon, and at the corner the library; then, around the corner along the west front, the billiard room, the gun room, her flower room, a smoking room and the estate office. On the second floor, the family bedrooms were mostly on the south side, the main guest rooms on the west side and the servants’ rooms over the kitchens to the northeast, out of sight."
B0024CEY362,B0024CEY36,"One of the twins would inherit Walden Hall when Stephen died, unless Lydia gave birth to a boy late in life. I could, she thought; I feel as if I could, but it just doesn’t happen.

It was almost time to be getting ready for dinner. She sighed. She felt comfortable and natural in her tea gown, with her fair hair dressed loosely; but now she would have to be laced into a corset and have her hair piled high on her head by a maid. It was said that some of the young women were giving up corsets altogether. That was all right, Lydia supposed, if you were naturally shaped like the figure eight, but she was small in all the wrong places.

She got up and went outside. That undergardener was standing by a rose tree, talking to one of the maids. Lydia recognized the maid: she was Annie, a pretty, voluptuous, empty-headed girl with a wide, generous smile. She stood with her hands in the pockets of her apron, turning her round face up to the sun and laughing at something the gardener had said. Now there is a girl who doesn’t need a corset, Lydia thought. Annie was supposed to be supervising Charlotte and Belinda, for the governess had the afternoon off."
B0024CEY363,B0024CEY36,"It was true that he had befriended Jews and singers, but that did not make him a rake. Anyway, he had stayed at Walden Hall twice—once as Prince of Wales and once as King Edward VII—and he had behaved impeccably both times.

She wondered whether the new King would ever come. It was a great strain, to have a monarch to stay, but such a thrill to make the house look its very best and have the most lavish meals imaginable and buy twelve new dresses just for one weekend. And if this King were to come, he might grant the Waldens the coveted entrée —the right to go into Buckingham Palace by the garden entrance on big occasions, instead of queuing up in The Mall along with two hundred other carriages.

She thought about her guests this weekend. George was Stephen’s younger brother: he had Stephen’s charm but none of Stephen’s seriousness. George’s daughter, Belinda, was eighteen, the same age as Charlotte. Both girls would be coming out this season. Belinda’s mother had died some years ago and George had married again, rather quickly. His second wife, Clarissa, was much younger than he, and quite vivacious. She had given him twin sons."
B01N6IHCSA0,B01N6IHCSA,"His wife, Lianne, had never been able to accustom herself to such violent love, though at the beginning, having come from a family that suppressed even its sneezes, she had been attracted to its heat. Early on in their courtship, Epstein had told her that from his father’s brutality and tenderness he’d learned that a person can’t be reduced, a lesson that had guided him all his life, and for a long time Lianne thought of this—of Epstein’s own complexity, his resistance to easy categorization—as something to love. But in the end it had exhausted her just as it had exhausted so many others, though never his parents, who remained his tireless sparring partners, and who, Epstein sometimes felt, had lived on with such tenacity only to torment him. He’d taken care of them until the end, which they’d lived out in a penthouse he bought for them in Miami, with deep-pile carpets that came up to their ankles. But he had never found peace with them, and only after their deaths— his mother following his father within three months — and after he’d given nearly everything away did Epstein feel the sharp stab of regret. The naked bulb sputtered on and off behind his inflamed lids when he tried to sleep. He couldn’t sleep. Had he accidentally given sleep away, along with everything else?"
B01N6IHCSA1,B01N6IHCSA,"Looking in at the strangely vague Epstein in the dark interior, he wondered briefly whether there was something more grave going on with his longtime client—a kind of neurological turbulence, perhaps, that might develop toward the extreme before it was diagnosed as medical. At the time, Schloss had brushed the thought off, but later it came back to him as prescient.

And indeed at last, after nearly a year of chipping away at the accumulations of a lifetime, Epstein arrived at the bottommost layer. There, he hit on the memory of his parents, who had washed up on the shores of Palestine after the war and conceived him under a burned-out bulb that they had not had enough money to replace. At the age of sixty-eight, having cleared a space to think, he found himself consumed by that darkness, deeply moved by it. His parents had brought him, their only son, to America, and once they’d learned English, resumed the screaming match that they’d begun in other languages. Later his sister Joanie came along, but she, a dreamy, unresponsive child, refused to take the bait, and so the battle remained triangulated. His parents screamed at each other, and they screamed at him, and he screamed back at them, together and separately."
B01N6IHCSA2,B01N6IHCSA,"She was always giving him strange books, some of which he read, and many of which he didn’t, a practice that never seemed to bother her— naturally free-spirited, she was the opposite of her brother, Jonah, and rarely took offense at anything. Epstein had opened the cover one evening with no intention of reading it, but it had pulled him in with an almost magnetic force. It was by an Israeli poet, Polish-born, who had died at sixty-six, two years younger than the age Epstein had just turned. But the little autobiographical book, the testament of a man alone facing God, had been written when the poet was only twenty-seven. It had overwhelmed him, Epstein told Schloss. At twenty-seven, he himself had been blinded by his ambition and appetite—for success, for money, for sex, for beauty, for love, for the magnitudes but also the nitty-gritty, for everything visible, smellable, palpable. What might his life have been if he had applied himself with the same intensity to the spiritual realm? Why had he closed himself off from it so completely?

As he spoke, Schloss had taken him in: his darting eyes, the silver hair that came down over his collar, striking because of how meticulous he had always been about his appearance."
B01N6IHCSA3,B01N6IHCSA,"He even made the down payment on a house for the daughter of an old friend; not any house, but a large Greek Revival with old trees and more lawn than the surprised new owner knew what to do with. His lawyer, Schloss—the executor of his estate, and his longtime confidant—was not allowed to interfere. Schloss had once had another client who’d caught the disease of radical charity, a billionaire who gave away his houses one by one, followed by the ground under his feet. It was a kind of addiction, he told Epstein, and later he might come to regret it. After all, he was not yet seventy; he could still live thirty more years. But Epstein had barely seemed to listen, just as he hadn’t listened when the lawyer strenuously argued against letting Lianne walk away with the entirety of her fortune, and just as he didn’t listen a few months later when Schloss again tried to dissuade him, this time from retiring from the firm where he’d been a partner for twenty-five years. Across the table, Epstein had only smiled and changed the subject to his reading, which had recently taken a mystical turn.

It had begun with a book Maya had given to him for his birthday, he told Schloss."
B078MHVNWZ0,B078MHVNWZ,"Without comment, he turns me around and walks me back along a new hallway until we come to an open door. He more or less pushes me inside then locks the door behind me.

Now I'm waiting for the daughter I've never met. My hands are sweaty, and my lips feel numb. Scary stuff. I hear the door lock disengage. The door slowly creaks open, and a young woman shuffles inside.

She's wearing Day-Glo orange. Her hair is two braids. Her wrists are manacled and waist-chained. Her feet are chained as well. But the face. That's what makes me almost cry out.

She looks like me. Her mother is black, so there's that, but her features are not her mother's. They are mine. Even the eyes: blue as the sky. She reminds me of Halle Berry; she is that beautiful. I ignore the neck tattoo, the Harley roses. There is no jewelry, of course; that is long gone. She clutches a fat file of papers where her hands are joined by the cuffs. She doesn't look directly at me. Instead, she shuffles to the round steel table and backs onto the bench along the wall. Then she slides her feet and legs in after her. Now she looks up. There is no recognition in her eyes."
B078MHVNWZ1,B078MHVNWZ,"Maybe I just need him to hold my hand while I witness my daughter's execution.

She must have family present when she dies.

As in, me.

DAY 1/30

The next morning, I wake up in Tacoma after the redeye from Spokane last night. My room is in a local hotel. The furniture is itchy and worn. Last night it didn't look so worn. I'm guessing the same is true of me. I have coffee brought to my room, shower and shave and catch a cab to the airport.

I tell my cabbie to wait in line along the loading curb outside the United terminal. Marcel will appear at any second. I cannot afford to miss him because my cases need Marcel if they're ever to gel. My eyes lose their focus, and my head swims. I feel like I'm coming down with something. It again feels like the walls are closing in; I can only imagine what my daughter must be feeling on death row.

Marcel briskly exits the terminal doors, a backpack in one hand, the other pulling his roll-along. He's looking this way and that. I lower the window and wave to him and call. He angles toward my cab."
B078MHVNWZ2,B078MHVNWZ,"Local time has it much earlier, though I haven't done the math yet.

I reach to the overhead stowage and retrieve my bag then head for the door. Two men wearing cowboy hats, jeans, white button-down shirts and walking heels on their cowboy boots block my exit. They are standing in the aisle, jaw-boning, as cowboys might put it. If they turn to look, they'll see I'm pissed at them for blocking the aisle. I draw a deep breath and try to relax. The reality of my unexpected trip and abandonment of my family on the eve of July Fourth and fireworks on the Capitol Mall is wearing thin. But when I juxtapose that missed holiday celebration against the reality of a daughter whom I've never met and don't know, and the terrible reality of her incarceration, the nation's birthday pales in comparison. I am exactly where I'm supposed to be, as Verona—my wife—said I would be as I was leaving. She was right.

At last, the cowboys move on; their cowboy hats pulled low on their foreheads.

It's late, yes, but I jump in a cab and head for the detention center anyway. A strong pull—the gravity of family —is reeling me in."
B078MHVNWZ3,B078MHVNWZ,"but nobody's called the cops on me, either. They haven't missed out, and I have no regrets. But it hasn't been easy. A friend of mine in law school once said that the semester exam on property law was like being handcuffed and rolled up in chains and tossed into the North Atlantic Ocean's stormy night. So alike being someone's dad. It never fails to humble me.

Fathering children is about chemistry and biology inspired by lust.

Parenting them, on the other hand, is a whole other North Atlantic.

I am ashamed of those things I did. I know what's required. I must commit to righting the wrongs inflicted on Cache Evans as much as possible. I must go the extra mile times ten. I acted absurdly at her conception. Now she deserves better.

Scuttling across the U.S. at 37,000 feet, I have only myself to blame.

My deepest wounds are mostly self-inflicted.

Enough said.

Chapter 3

We make Seattle six hours after takeoff from Reagan International. A thirty-minute layover drags on for hours, it seems. Then I board an eastbound Delta flight. Next-stop: Spokane and the detention center.

We land in a summer rainstorm. It's somewhere around midnight by my EST wristwatch."
B000FCKEF40,B000FCKEF4,"The dancing had stopped and the crowd broken up into smaller groups, men gathered in a circle near the fire, lighting their pipes, the younger men disappeared somewhere. All around her, families were settling in for the night, making nests for themselves in the hay. Some were in the house, more in the barn; she could hear the sound of a guitar from somewhere behind the house, and a single voice, singing something slow and wistful. It made her yearn suddenly for the sound of Roger’s voice as it had been, rich and tender.

Thinking of that, though, she realized something; his voice had been much better when he came back from consoling Ronnie. Still husky and with only a shadow of its former resonance — but it had come easily, without that choked note in it. Perhaps alcohol relaxed the vocal cords?

More likely, she thought, it simply relaxed Roger; removed some of his inhibitions about the way he sounded. That was worth knowing. Her mother had opined that his voice would improve, if he would stretch it, work with it, but he was shy of using it, wary of pain—whether from the actual sensation of speaking, or from the contrast with the way he had sounded before."
B000FCKEF41,B000FCKEF4,"She went reluctantly, but Brianna saw that by the time they had reached the dance, Lizzie was laughing at something Manfred had said, and he was smiling down at her, the firelight glowing on the handsome planes of his face. They were a nice-looking couple, she thought, better-matched in appearance than Senga and her Heinrich—who was tall, but spindly and rather hatchet-faced.

Inga and Hilda had begun arguing with each other in German, allowing Brianna to devote herself to the wholehearted consumption of the excellent supper. Hungry as she was, she would have enjoyed almost anything, but the tart, crisp sauerkraut and the sausages, bursting with juice and spices, were a rare treat.

It was only as she wiped the last of the juice and grease from her wooden plate with a chunk of corn bread that she cast a glance at the cooper’s shop, thinking guiltily that she ought perhaps to have saved some for Roger. He was so kind, taking thought for poor Ronnie’s feelings. She felt a rush of pride and affection for him. Maybe she should go over there and rescue him.

She had put down her plate and was sorting out her skirts and petticoats, in preparation for putting this plan into action, when she was forestalled by a pair of small figures who came weaving out of the darkness."
B000FCKEF42,B000FCKEF4,"he thought the man was not accustomed to the Kahnyen’kehaka; he’d not much of their speech, and plainly expected them to take his scalp at any moment, something they had thought hilarious—and one or two would likely have tried it, for a joke, save that Tewaktenyonh said to treat him with respect. Ian had been pressed to interpret for him, a job he’d done, though without much pleasure in it. He would much sooner think himself Mohawk than acknowledge any kinship with Bad Sweat.

Uncle Jamie, though … he’d make a better job of it, by far. Would he do it? Ian listened to the voices with a vague sense of interest, but it was clear that Uncle Jamie would not be pressed for a decision. MacDonald might as soon get a grip on a frog in a spring, he thought, hearing his uncle elude commitment.

He sighed, put his arm around Rollo, and eased more of his weight onto the dog. He felt awful. He would have supposed he was dying, save that Auntie Claire had said he’d feel poorly for several days. He was sure she would have stayed if he were dying, not gone and left him with only Rollo for company.

The shutters were still open, and cold air poured over him, chilly and soft at once, the way spring nights were. He felt Rollo raise his nose, sniffing, and utter a low, eager whine. Possum, maybe, or a raccoon."
B000FCKEF43,B000FCKEF4,"Aye, of course; the Crown employed men to go out to the tribes, offer them gifts, tobacco, and knives and the like. Tell them silliness about German Geordie, as though the King was like to come and sit down by the council fires at the next Rabbit Moon and speak like a man.

He smiled grimly to think of it. The notion was plain enough; cozen the Indians to fight for the English, when fighting was needed. But why should they think it needed now? The French had yielded, retreated to their northern foothold in Canada.

Oh. He remembered belatedly what Brianna had told him about the new fighting to come. He’d not known whether to believe her — perhaps she was right, though, in which case … he didn’t want to think about it. Or about anything.

Rollo padded over to him, sat and leaned heavily against him. He leaned back, resting his head in the thick fur.

An Indian agent had come once, while he lived in Snaketown. A fat wee fellow, shifty-eyed and with a tremble in his voice. He thought the man—Christ, what was his name? The Mohawk had called him Bad Sweat, and that fit; he stank as though with a mortal illness—"
B01LY7FD0D0,B01LY7FD0D,"As Ávila crossed the courtyard toward the museum’s entrance, he gently touched the rosary in his pocket.

CHAPTER 3

The museum atrium felt like a futuristic cathedral.

As Langdon stepped inside, his gaze shifted immediately skyward, climbing a set of colossal white pillars along a towering curtain of glass, ascending two hundred feet to a vaulted ceiling, where halogen spotlights blazed pure white light. Suspended in the air, a network of catwalks and balconies traversed the heavens, dotted with black-and-white-clad visitors who moved in and out of the upper galleries and stood at high windows, admiring the lagoon below. Nearby, a glass elevator slid silently back down the wall, returning to earth to collect more guests.

It was like no museum Langdon had ever seen. Even the acoustics felt foreign. Instead of the traditional reverent hush created by sound-dampening finishes, this place was alive with murmuring echoes of voices percolating off the stone and glass. For Langdon, the only familiar sensation was the sterile tang on the back of his tongue; museum air was the same worldwide—filtered meticulously of all particulates and oxidants and then moistened with ionized water to 45 percent humidity.

Langdon moved through a series of surprisingly tight security points, noticing more than a few armed guards, and finally found himself standing at another check-in table. A young woman was handing out headsets."
B01LY7FD0D1,B01LY7FD0D,"Several days ago, the Regent had shared with him a secret so disturbing that Ávila had seen no choice but to offer himself fully to the cause. The brutality of last night’s mission still haunted him, and yet he knew his actions would be forgiven.

Righteousness exists in many forms.

And more death will come before tonight is over.

As Ávila emerged into an open plaza on the riverbank, he raised his eyes to the massive structure before him. It was an undulating mess of perverse forms covered in metal tile—as if two thousand years of architectural progress had been tossed out the window in favor of total chaos.

Some call this a museum. I call it a monstrosity.

Focusing his thoughts, Ávila crossed the plaza, winding his way through a series of bizarre sculptures outside Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum. As he neared the building, he watched dozens of guests mingling in their finest black and white.

The godless masses have congregated.

But tonight will not go as any of them imagine.

He straightened his admiral’s cap and smoothed his jacket, mentally fortifying himself for the task that lay ahead. Tonight was part of a far greater mission—a crusade of righteousness."
B01LY7FD0D2,B01LY7FD0D,"When Ávila regained consciousness, he was unable to breathe in the thick smoke, and for a moment he had no idea where he was or what had happened.

Then, above the ringing in his ears, he heard the anguished screams. Ávila clambered to his feet, realizing with horror where he was. He told himself this was all a terrible dream. He staggered back through the smoke-filled cathedral, clambering past moaning and mutilated victims, stumbling in desperation to the approximate area where his wife and son had been smiling only moments ago.

There was nothing there.

No pews. No people.

Only bloody debris on the charred stone floor.

The grisly memory was mercifully shattered by the chime of the jangling bar door. Ávila seized his tónica and took a quick sip, shaking off the darkness as he had been forced to do so many times before.

The bar door swung wide, and Ávila turned to see two burly men stumble in. They were singing an off-key Irish fight song and wearing green fútbol jerseys that strained to cover their bellies. Apparently, this afternoon’s match had gone the way of Ireland’s visiting team.

I’ll take that as my cue, Ávila thought, standing up. He asked for his bill, but the barmaid winked and waved him off. Ávila thanked her and turned to go."
B01LY7FD0D3,B01LY7FD0D,"The horrific event that all but destroyed Ávila’s life five years ago would forever lurk in the recesses of his mind—a single deafening instant in which the earth had opened up and swallowed him whole.

Cathedral of Seville.

Easter morning.

The Andalusian sun was streaming through stained glass, splashing kaleidoscopes of color in radiant bursts across the cathedral’s stone interior. The pipe organ thundered in joyous celebration as thousands of worshippers celebrated the miracle of resurrection.

Ávila knelt at the Communion rail, his heart swelling with gratitude. After a lifetime of service to the sea, he had been blessed with the greatest of God’s gifts—a family. Smiling broadly, Ávila turned and glanced back over his shoulder at his young wife, María, who was still seated in the pews, far too pregnant to make the long walk up the aisle. Beside her, their three-year-old son, Pepe, waved excitedly at his father. Ávila winked at the boy, and María smiled warmly at her husband.

Thank you, God , Ávila thought as he turned back to the railing to accept the chalice.

An instant later, a deafening explosion ripped through the pristine cathedral.

In a flash of light, his entire world erupted in fire.

The blast wave drove Ávila violently forward into the Communion rail, his body crushed by the scalding surge of debris and human body parts."
B01DCAV4W20,B01DCAV4W2,"The creation of the Forge of Heavens had attracted many more villagers and they were all walking through it amazed. Even the dwarves were walking around with expressions of quiet glee, and sometimes they weren’t even that quiet. Richter didn’t know how long the detente between the territorial smiths and the other villagers would last, but he planned to take advantage of the peace and silence as long as he could.

Crafting, Smithing or Enchanting, he asked himself. When he had planted the Seed Core, he hadn’t been given an option. His Herb Lore skill had just skyrocketed. He hadn’t been able to make too much use of that yet, but he was sure it would come in handy in the future. So now Richter had a decision to make. With his Limitless ability, it wasn’t really a question of which skill he should learn. Given enough time, he should theoretically be able to learn everything. The real question was, what would give him the best bonus right now? It would be great to make his own weapons. He could just see himself wielding his own katana, fighting off ninjas and then moving his mouth dramatically to form Japanese words while waiting for English words to come out on a delay. Shogun Assassin style!"
B01DCAV4W21,B01DCAV4W2,"You have crafted a Legendary Object: The Forge of Heavens. You have learned two new skills.

Congratulations! You have learned the skill: Crafting. It is not only weapons and armor that will serve you well in The Land. Rings, belts, bracelets and other items have their own value. If enchanted, these items can easily be the difference between life and death. You now have the ability to take base components and create something greater than the sum of its parts. +1% Durability, Value, and Success Rate of Crafted Items.

Congratulations! You have learned the skill: Smithing. You may now take raw materials and unlock their potential to help or harm. It may be shining silver or gleaming gold that capture a woman’s eye, but it is sharp steel and mighty mithril that can cut out a man’s heart! +1% Durability, Attack or Defense of Forged Items

In light of this amazing achievement, you may choose to drastically increase your skill level in either of your two new skills or your existing skill of enchanting. Which do you choose? Smithing skill, Enchanting skill or Crafting skill?

Richter blinked and minimized the prompts. He took in his surroundings. Everyone around him was walking around entranced by their surroundings."
B01DCAV4W22,B01DCAV4W2,"He clapped his hands together in awe of what he was seeing. Of course that brought another round of vile cursing to his throat. The changes around him had pushed the fact that his hand had been badly burned right out of his head. He looked around embarrassed, and curtailed his profanity when he saw one of the high elves holding her hands over her son’s ears. Besides, he was being bombarded with prompts.

Congratulations! You have created: The Forge of Heavens! Each Magic Forge will have a specific character based upon the location where it has been created. The movement of heavenly bodies are now clearly seen by you, even in the light of day. Based upon which cosmic alignments are present above, there is a small chance of the weapon or armor obtaining certain powers.

Know This! Your Magic Forge has been built with elementum. Any weapons and armor made within the confines of the Magic Forge will have increased spell penetration and spell resistance, respectively.

Your Magic Forge is currently: Level 1. At this level, weapons have +10% damage against spell barriers. At this level, each piece of armor has a +2% resistance to a specific type of magic determined by the properties of your Forge.

Congratulations!"
B01DCAV4W23,B01DCAV4W2,"Each was now composed of the same clear green metal as the first. Even the tools that had been hanging from the walls were no longer black iron, but instead had handles of burnished high steel and elementum heads. Multiple sets were stacked on stands made of quartz.

The entire Magic Forge was a balance of utility and beauty. Before anyone could touch anything, a pulse of light drew everyone’s gaze upward.

The roof had become a flat black surface. From looking around, Richter could see that the roof extended out past the pillars for several feet in every direction. The floor of the Forge was now well-protected from the elements. The pulse of golden light had come from near the center of the ceiling. As Richter watched, tiny motes of light appeared randomly as well. More and more appeared, and he realized that he was staring at a starlit sky. As the ceiling became filled with more celestial bodies, Richter’s eyes kept being pulled back to the one large yellow circle that didn’t seem to fit with the rest of the ceiling. It wasn’t until he saw two pale circles, one red and the other white, that it clicked."
B079WJL86J0,B079WJL86J,"It was a bad combination of acting out due to anger along with being the new, hot guy on campus at the local college I’d transferred to.

Over time, though, I began to accept things as they were. After all, even if Amber had been available, I knew I wasn’t the right guy for her anyway. She deserved someone who wouldn’t screw her over, someone like… Rory. He was safe. I grew to accept them together, and she and I were able to renew our friendship, although things were never exactly the same again between the three of us—especially between Rory and me. And he knew why.

Had seeing them together still hurt like a motherfucker? Yes. But I’d accepted that he was the better man for her. Sucking up my jealousy and pride, I ended up moving on.

So, finding out that he’d broken her heart all these years later was a tough pill to swallow. If he were in front of me right now, there was no guarantee I wouldn’t injure him.

I flipped my pillow around and fluffed it while Kitty purred and curled up into the crook of my neck. A sneeze from behind the bedroom door was the first indication that Amber, too, wasn’t getting any sleep.

I got up. She was leaning against the kitchen counter blowing her nose."
B079WJL86J1,B079WJL86J,"So, when Rory came to me and confessed his feelings for Amber one night, I felt like I needed to tell him how I really felt about her, too. My jealousy was through the roof, even though I didn’t think he was any kind of competition for me. That had been the one consolation— or so I thought. We agreed that since we couldn’t both have her, that neither of us would tell her how we felt. We’d come to the understanding that it was better to keep our friendship intact—both with each other and with Amber.

I therefore didn’t feel like I needed to watch my back when I went away to the University of Florida, leaving my friends behind. I trusted that he wouldn’t move in on her and even more so, I figured that if he did, she wouldn’t return his feelings. It was like double security in my mind.

Homesick, I decided to transfer back to a state school after my first year in Gainesville was up. When I came home that summer and found out that they were together, it felt like the ultimate betrayal. I alienated myself from both of them for a while. During that time, my manwhore ways were worse than ever once the school year started up again."
B079WJL86J2,B079WJL86J,"None of the girls I’d hooked up with in high school or college meant anything to me. Amber was really the only girl I’d ever developed feelings for at the time. They never escalated to the point of love, but I cared about her, wanted to protect her.

Before Lainey died, Amber was merely my sister’s friend. After Lainey passed away, Amber and I got closer. She was the only person keeping me sane during one of the most difficult periods of my life—those months after my sister’s death.

But actually dating Amber back then was never something I considered a realistic option. I was too young and unpredictable. Not to mention, I was the spawn of an asshole, womanizing father. What if the apple didn’t fall far from the tree? I was certain I’d end up hurting her. She was like a sister to me—a sister I secretly wanted to fuck but knew I never would. And I guess my attitude was that Rory should have felt the same way since the three of us were supposed to be friends. He and I should’ve wanted to protect her, not take advantage of her. But yet, what we should’ve felt didn’t matter. We both wanted her."
B079WJL86J3,B079WJL86J,"And that was pretty funny considering I couldn’t ever act on them.

Years ago, I’d come to terms with the fact that Amber and Rory were together, because I assumed at the very least, he would do right by her and cherish her. It was the only reason I didn’t beat the shit out of him when I came home from college and realized he’d broken our pact, pursued her, and had fucking taken her virginity.

Back when we were teenagers, I’d always known that Rory wanted Amber. What I never considered was that she could return his feelings. The three of us would hang out together, watching movies or just chilling down in my basement, and I’d catch him staring at her when she wasn’t looking. He’d be fixated on her, and I would be fixated on his fixation with her. She was oblivious to his feelings and even more oblivious to mine, because I hid them really well. It was no exaggeration to say I’d probably hooked up with all of Amber’s friends. So, yeah, I was really good at throwing her off. I’m certain she never suspected that I liked her as more than a friend. My actions certainly never demonstrated that."
B000JMKV9Y0,B000JMKV9Y,"His black eyes, so much like a large bird’s, flitted about the paper as he shifted from one foot to the other in sudden, quick movements. He held the Times in his right hand, and his left arm, underdeveloped as the result of a childhood injury, was pulled in close to his body. The left hand occasionally rose to swipe at his neatly trimmed mustache and the small patch of beard under his lower lip. His dark hair, cut far too long to meet the fashion of the day, and swept back on his head, was moist, for he always went hatless; and this, along with the bobbing of his face at the pages before him, only increased the impression of some hungry, restless hawk determined to wring satisfaction from the worrisome world around him.

Standing next to Kreizler was the enormous Cyrus Montrose, Laszlo’s valet, occasional driver, effective bodyguard, and alter ego. Like most of Kreizler’s employees, Cyrus was a former patient, one who made me more than a little nervous, despite his apparently controlled manner and appearance. That morning he was dressed in gray pants and a tightly buttoned brown jacket, and his broad, black features did not seem even to register my approach. But as I came closer he tapped Kreizler on the arm and pointed my way."
B000JMKV9Y1,B000JMKV9Y,"—before I rapped on the roof of the cab with my first and assured my man that I did need to get to Bellevue this morning. With a rude jerk we spun right at Twenty-third, and then plowed through the thoroughly unregulated intersection of that street with Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Passing the squat bulk of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where Boss Platt made his headquarters and was probably putting the finishing touches to the Greater New York scheme at that very moment, we turned up along the eastern edge of Madison Square Park to Twenty-sixth, then changed directions in front of the Italianate arcades and towers of Madison Square Garden to head east once more. The square, solemn, red-brick buildings of Bellevue appeared on the horizon, and in just a few more minutes we crossed First Avenue and pulled up behind a large black ambulance on the Twenty-sixth Street side of the hospital grounds, near the entrance to the Insane Pavilion. I paid my cabbie off and headed in.

The Pavilion was a simple building, long and rectangular. A small, uninviting vestibule greeted visitors and internees, and beyond this, through the first of many iron doors, was a wide corridor running down the center of the building."
B000JMKV9Y2,B000JMKV9Y,"I swore loudly against their progeny and shook the dead umbrella at them, prompting the woman to scream in fright and the man to fix an anxious eye on me and tell me I was mad—all of which, considering my destination, gave me a good chuckle and made the wet wait for another hansom much easier. When one came around the corner of Washington Place I did not wait for it to stop, but leapt in, shut the doors around my legs, and hollered to the driver to get me to the Insane Pavilion at Bellevue: not the kind of order any cabbie wants to hear. The look of dismay on his face as we drove off gave me another little laugh, so that by the time we hit Fourteenth Street I didn’t even mind the feel of wet tweed against my legs.

With the perversity of the typical New York City cabman, my driver—the collar of his raincoat turned up and his top hat encased in a thin rubber sheath—decided to battle his way through the shopping district along Sixth Avenue above Fourteenth Street before turning east. We had slowly passed most of the big department stores— O’Neill ’s, Adams & Company, Simpson-Crawford"
B000JMKV9Y3,B000JMKV9Y,"It was her way; and for all that it was annoying, to a man who, within recent memory, had lost what he was sure was his only chance at domestic happiness, it was still better than a lonely apartment in a building full of other men who had resigned themselves to solitary lives.

Snatching a gray cap and a black umbrella as I dashed out the front door, I made for Sixth Avenue at a brisk pace. The rain was coming down much harder now, and a particularly stiff wind had begun to blow. When I reached the avenue the force of air suddenly changed directions as it swept under the tracks of the New York Elevated Railroad line, which ran above either side of the street just inside the sidewalks. The shift blasted my umbrella inside out, along with those of several other members of the throng that was hustling under the tracks; and the combined effect of the heightening wind, the rain, and the cold was to make the usually bustling rush hour seem absolute pandemonium. Making for a cab as I struggled with my cumbersome, useless umbrella, I was cut off by a merry young couple who maneuvered me out of their way with no great finesse and clambered quickly into my hansom."
B07197QN1W0,B07197QN1W,"It seemed to Isabel that he was bewailing not the particular but the general, as if today at last all of his misfortunate and bedevilled life, if it merited to be called a life, had come to a head somehow and overwhelmed him. Should she have defied Staines and offered him, if nothing else, at least a word or two of comfort? She suspected there would be no comforting a sorrow such as his, yet that suspicion, however strong it might be, did not exonerate her. Was it not her duty, from her place of vantage, to reach down a hand to the crushed and helpless, to the ones who might have soared but instead had plummeted from the sky and lay now with broken wing, flailing and twitching on the pavement at her feet? Her spirit, the better part of her, moaned in sympathy with the weeping man, yet in another cold and calculating region of her consciousness the necessary defences were already being erected. What, after all, could she have done for the poor wretch? What comfort would a word of hers have brought to him? Money, yes, she might have given him money, and a large portion of it, at that; but even her silver would not have saved him, for surely he was beyond saving. No: as well hope to help the lost souls in Hades. And yet."
B07197QN1W1,B07197QN1W,"It was true, she had never witnessed a grown-up human being display in public such helplessness, such haplessness, such raw infantile grief, yet now it occurred to her, who had lately suffered so many blows to the spirit, to wonder why it was not more common, why it was not an everyday occurrence, to be witnessed at any time at any street corner— why were we not all given to periodic outbursts of public wailings? For in the scale of things, she was sure, the weight of the world’s sorrow would sink the balance so sharply that the pan on that side would make a brassy bang on the counter-top. Indeed, she felt at this moment that she might direct the cab to stop, and leap down and run back and take her place beside that poor soul and pour out her own distress upon the commonplace air; but of course she did not.

How had the man arrived at such a sorry pass? From the intense manner of his weeping it might have newly dawned on him how desperate were his circumstances, yet it was not lately he had stumbled into such wretched straits, that much was plain. Perhaps some fresh misfortune had just befallen him."
B07197QN1W2,B07197QN1W,"And yet it was understandable, after all: the maid’s instincts were those of a still uninfected person spurning a doomed victim of the plague. To Isabel, however, whose store of bullion in the bank guaranteed her immunity, it was plain that her duty lay precisely in helping such as he, the unfortunate and fallen ones of the world. But the rules were the rules: they applied in both directions, downwards as well as upwards, and she knew the impossibility of disobeying her servant and going to the weeping man even if it were for no more than to press a coin shamefacedly into his hand.

In the hansom cab, the choosing of which was a right Staines naturally arrogated to herself, Isabel sat hard by the open window to have the benefit of what freshness the city air could offer. After her moment of mild exaltation on exiting the station she had relapsed once more into her former state of diminished numbness. The lingering rhythm of the train was replaced by the harshing of the cab’s steel-rimmed wheels on the metalled roadway. She viewed the panorama of the city passing in the window as if it were a running series of exhibits under glass."
B07197QN1W3,B07197QN1W,"She did not think she had ever seen or heard a grown man crying like this, copiously, helplessly, unstaunchably. His washed-blue eyes were red-rimmed, and his swollen and glistening nether lip trembled like a baby’s. He wore a collarless shirt, an ancient pair of moleskin trousers shiny with grime, and a jacket of rusty serge that was much too small for him and pinched him under the arms and left his frail white wrists defencelessly exposed. He stood in one spot but kept turning his body first in one direction and then the other, caught it seemed in a trance of convulsive indecision. Beside him on the pavement was a shapeless bundle of something tied up in a knotted rag. It had seemed at first he was wearing shoes, but now that Isabel looked more closely she saw that his feet were bare but thoroughly caked with black, tar-like dirt. The coppery brightness of his whiskers, through which dark glinting rivulets of tears were coursing, and the pulpy paleness of his lightly freckled skin, somehow added to and intensified, for her, the sorrow and abjection of the spectacle he made; it was as if he had been flayed of a protective integument, and his flaming hair were blushing for him to be so nakedly and shamefully on show."
B01HB9Q7CW0,B01HB9Q7CW,"The maid ushers me to a sitting room that, though still grand, shows signs of wear. The rugs are a bit frayed and there are some spaces in the silver cabinet that are empty, as though the bigger pieces had been taken or sold. Stale cigar smoke mixes with the scent of lemon polish. I peer out the window, straining to see my family’s estate through the fog that has settled above the valley. I wonder who lives in our villa now and what they see when they look down at the barren deserted winter quarters.

After our wedding, a small ceremony with a justice of the peace, I moved into Erich’s spacious apartment overlooking the Tiergarten. I spent my days strolling the shops along Bergmannstrasse, buying richly colored paintings and rugs and embroidered satin pillows, little things that would make his once-sparse quarters our home. Our biggest dilemma was which café to frequent for Sunday brunch.

I’d been in Berlin for almost five years when the war broke out. Erich received a promotion to something I didn’t understand having to do with munitions and his days became longer. He would come home either dark and moody, or heady with excitement about things he could not share with me."
B01HB9Q7CW1,B01HB9Q7CW,"I was not some young girl, easily wooed, but nearly twenty-nine. Busy with the circus and constantly on the road, I had assumed that marriage had passed me by. Erich was impossibly handsome, though, with a strong jaw marred only by a cleft chin, and square features softened by the bluest of eyes. He came a second night and pink roses appeared before my dressing room door. We courted that spring, and he made the long trip down from Berlin every weekend to the cities where we performed to spend time with me between shows and on Sundays.

We should have known even then that our relationship was doomed. Though Hitler had just come to power a year earlier, the Reich had already made clear its hatred for the Jews. But there was passion and intensity in Erich’s eyes that made everything around us cease to exist. When he proposed, I didn’t think twice. We did not see the problems that loomed large, making our future together impossible— we simply looked the other way.

My father had not fought me on leaving with Erich. I expected him to rebuke me for marrying a non-Jew, but he only smiled sadly when I told him."
B01HB9Q7CW2,B01HB9Q7CW,"My eyes travel across the hill toward the adjacent estate where the Circus Neuhoff has their winter quarters. Their hulking slate villa stands opposite ours, two sentries guarding the Rheinhessen valley between.

Earlier as the train neared Darmstadt, I saw a poster advertising the Circus Neuhoff. At first, my usual distaste at the name rose. Klemt and Neuhoff were rival circuses and we had competed for years, trying to outdo one another. But the circus, though dysfunctional, was still a family. Our two circuses had grown up alongside one another like siblings in separate bedrooms. We had been rivals on the road. In the off-season, though, we children went to school and played together, sledding down the hill and occasionally sharing meals. Once when Herr Neuhoff had been felled by a bad back and could not serve as ringmaster, we sent my brother Jules to help their show.

I have not seen Herr Neuhoff in years, though. And he is Gentile, so everything has changed. His circus flourishes while ours is gone. No, I cannot expect help from Herr Neuhoff, but perhaps he knows what became of my family.

When I reach the Neuhoff estate, a maidservant I do not recognize opens the door."
B01HB9Q7CW3,B01HB9Q7CW,"I see my brothers wrestling in the front yard before being cowed into practice, scolded for wasting their energy and risking an injury that would jeopardize the show. As children we loved to sleep under the open sky in the yard in summer, fingers intertwined, the sky a canopy of stars above us.

I stop. A large red flag with a black swastika hangs above the door. Someone, a high-ranking SS officer no doubt, has moved into the home that once was ours. I clench my fists, sickened to think of them using our linens and dishes, soiling Mama’s beautiful sofa and rugs with their boots. Then I look away. It is not the material things for which I mourn.

I search the windows of the villa, looking in vain for a familiar face. I had known that my family was no longer here ever since my last letter returned undeliverable. I had come anyway, though, some part of me imagining life unchanged, or at least hoping for a clue as to where they had gone. But wind blows through the desolate grounds. There is nothing left anymore.

I should not be here either, I realize. Anxiety quickly replaces my sadness. I cannot afford to loiter and risk being spotted by whoever lives here now, or face questions about who I am and why I have come."
B01K3WN2LS0,B01K3WN2LS,"His right eye was an empty crater because the bullet he’d fired into his chin had burst from there after catapulting through parts of the brain. His facial skin was deathly gray, where it wasn’t swollen and stained purple by burst capillaries. His breathing was erratic and the monitor showed his vitals to be fluctuating all over the place. He was in the critical care unit, the place designated for the sickest and most badly injured patients at the hospital.

But he wasn’t just injured; Walter Dabney was dying.

The doctors who had been in and out during the day had all confirmed that it was simply a matter of time before the brain told the heart to stop pumping. And there was nothing they could do about it. The damage was such that no medicine and no surgery could bring the man back. They were just counting down the time until death.

Mrs. Eleanor Dabney, better known as Ellie, had arrived thirty minutes after the FBI had told her what had happened. They would have to question her, but right now the woman was simply a grieving widow-to-be. She was currently in the bathroom throwing up, a nurse assisting her.

Bogart eyed Jamison. She seemed to sense his attention and glanced up."
B01K3WN2LS1,B01K3WN2LS,"Decker rose, showed her his ID, and said he was with an FBI task force. And also that he had witnessed the murder.

Decker glanced over as Todd Milligan, the fourth member of the joint task force, entered the room. A fifth member, Lisa Davenport, a psychologist by training, had not returned to the group, opting instead to go back to private practice in Chicago.

Milligan was in his midthirties, six feet tall, with close-cropped hair and a physique that appeared chiseled out of granite. He and Decker had initially butted heads, but now the two men got along as well as Decker could with anyone.

Decker had trouble relating to people. That had not always been the case, because he was not the same person he had once been.

In addition to the synesthesia, Decker also had hyperthymesia, or perfect recall, after suffering a brain trauma on the same vicious hit in his very short career in the NFL. It had altered his personality, changing him from gregarious and fun-loving to aloof and lacking the ability to recognize social cues—a skill most people took for granted. People first meeting him would assume he was somewhere on the autism spectrum.

And they might not be far off in that assumption."
B01K3WN2LS2,B01K3WN2LS,"Dabney’s recovering to the point of being questioned was simply not going to happen, the doctors had told them.

So for now, Decker simply sat in the darkness and stared at the covered body.

Although the room was not actually dark for him.

For Decker it was an ethereally bright blue. A near-fatal hit he’d received on the football field had commingled his sensory pathways, a condition known as synesthesia. For him, death was represented by the color blue. He had seen it on the street when Dabney had killed Berkshire.

And he was seeing it now.

Decker had given statements to the D.C. police and the FBI, as had the security guard who had joined him at the scene. There hadn’t been much to say. Dabney had pulled a gun and shot Berkshire and then himself. That was crystal clear. What wasn’t clear was why he had done it.

The overhead lights came on and a woman in a white lab coat walked in. The medical examiner introduced herself as Lynne Wainwright. She was in her forties, with the compressed, slightly haunted features of a person who had seen every sort of violence one human could wreak on another."
B01K3WN2LS3,B01K3WN2LS,"IT AWAITED us all, individually, in our final moments. Amos Decker was thinking that as he sat in the chair and studied the body.

Anne Berkshire lay on a metal table in the FBI ’s morgue. All her clothes had been removed and placed in evidence bags to be later analyzed. Her naked body was under a sheet; her destroyed face was covered as well, although the fabric was stained with her blood and destroyed tissue.

A postmortem was legally required even though there was no doubt whatsoever as to what had caused the woman’s death.

Walter Dabney, by an extraordinary twist, was not dead. Not yet, anyway. The doctors at the hospital to which he’d been rushed held no hope that he would recover, or even regain consciousness. The bullet had tunneled right through his brain; it was a miracle he had not died instantly.

Alex Jamison and Ross Bogart, two of Decker’s colleagues on a joint task force composed of civilians and FBI agents, were with Dabney at the hospital right now. If he regained consciousness they would want to capture anything he might utter that would explain why he had murdered Anne Berkshire on a public street and then attempted to take his own life."
B0711QCV3C0,B0711QCV3C,"Bobby drove us to the ferry station, where people could grab a boat to Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard, Provincetown, Portland or, in my case, Scupper Island, my hometown, a small island three miles off the rough and ragged coast of southern Maine. The Scupper Island ferry came to Boston almost every day; it was also the mail boat and could carry all of three cars.

Bobby unloaded my suitcases and bought my ticket. Our breakup had made him once again solicitous; he’d been a prince these past few days, fetching me my painkillers, reading to me as I fell asleep, even cooking for me.

I didn’t care. He’d been fondling someone’s hair in my hospital room, and that was not something I’d forget.

The ferry pulled in, a battered little thing, same as it had always been. Jake Ferriman, the eponymous captain of the boat, was a fixture. He didn’t acknowledge me, just tied up the boat and jumped off, a small sack of mail in one hand.

I’d hoped my mom would come on the ferry to get me; I’d called her when I was discharged from the hospital and told her I’d be coming home, that I’d been hurt but was okay — I think I used the words expected to recover, always looking for attention where my mother was concerned."
B0711QCV3C1,B0711QCV3C,"* *

A week later, still sore and slow, arm in a sling, leg in a soft brace, one crutch to balance me, I looked around our apartment for the last time. Bobby’s apartment, really. Roseline had come over last night, and we got a little weepy, but she said she’d come see me on Scupper. Bobby had thoughtfully made himself scarce and had been sleeping on the couch all week.

I should never have moved in with him. We’d only been dating a couple of months before the Big Bad Event, after which we shacked up. Way too early. But then, going back to my place was out of the question. He said we were moving in together, I said yes. Also, we’d been in love.

And lest we forget, Bobby got off on saving people.

In the week since I was hit by Beantown Bug Killers (who had sent flowers every day), I’d done a lot of thinking. I wanted to stop being afraid, stop settling for the half love Bobby gave me, to stop feeling so gray. The time had come.

Bobby stood by the door, Boomer on the leash. There were tears in his aqua-blue eyes."
B0711QCV3C2,B0711QCV3C,"It had always been a long shot, I knew that, but I’d imagined stalking him after he did a show on Broadway, waiting by the side door, our eyes meeting, his inimitable smile, going out for a drink, sharing our favorite moments from Harry Potter, me finding out that he, too, hated the destruction of Hogwarts and agreed that Ron was nowhere near worthy of Hermione. Now, with me dead, it definitely wasn’t gonna happen.

True, no one was acting like I was dead, but I was fairly certain I was. Maybe they just hadn’t noticed yet. I guessed this ER wasn’t quite the be-all and end-all of modern medicine, was it? I thought I’d heard the words dislocated patella and ortho consult and trauma alert. I was pretty sure I’d seen the tunnel of light, but my spirit was tuning in and out.

What was that beeping? It was really hurting my head.

I’d read about this kind of thing happening. Out-of-body experiences. The soul lingering a little while before heading for the afterlife. Did I know anyone who’d greet me from heaven? My dad, maybe, if he was dead? That mean-ass grandmother of mine who used to tell me I was fat? I hoped she wasn’t there. Who else? Maybe that sweet patient who’d died of pancreatic cancer during my fellowship. God, I had loved her. My first fatality."
B0711QCV3C3,B0711QCV3C,"He’d be sad and confused for the rest of his life.

I knew I shouldn’t have waited for stupid Bobby! And why the hell was I the one getting the pizza? Why hadn’t I stood up for myself and told beautiful, snotty Jabrielle to go her damn self? She was a resident! I was a fully vested doctor, thank you!

But I hadn’t, and now I was dead.

I hope we can still go with open casket.

I had often envisioned my funeral—me lying against the rose-colored satin, looking utterly stunning, the sadder songs of U2 and Ed Sheeran playing gently in the background while my friends wept and laughed over their precious memories of me. A closed casket was not part of the scenario, hit by Beantown Bug Killers or not. I wondered if my face was smooshed in. Eesh.

I have nothing to wear to my funeral.

Granted, in life I’d been a clothes whore, at least during the past fifteen years or so. But for my funeral, I wanted something special. The navy-blue-and-white polka-dot Brooks Brothers dress I’d been eyeing, or that pink floral Kate Spade. But maybe that would be too festive.

I’ll never meet Daniel Radcliffe now."
B001BANK320,B001BANK32,"so they look like a couple of goddam roadmaps, the jools drippin off her neck and arms an hangin out her ears. And she’s got this kid with her , he can’t be no more than seventeen, with hair down to his asshole and his crotch bulgin like he stuffed it up with the funnypages. So they’re here a week, ten days maybe, and every night it’s the same drill. Down in the Colorado Lounge from five to seven, her suckin up Singapore slings like they’re gonna outlaw em tomorrow and him with just the one bottle of Olympia, suckin it, makin it last. And she’d be makin jokes and sayin all these witty things, and every time she said one he’d grin just like a fuckin ape, like she had strings tied to the corners of his mouth. Only after a few days you could see it was gettin harder an harder for him to grin, and God knows what he had to think about to get his pump primed by bedtime. Well, they’d go in for dinner, him walkin and her staggerin, drunk as a coot, you know, and he’d be pinchin the waitresses and grinnin at em when she wasn’t lookin. Hell, we even had bets on how long he’d last."
B001BANK321,B001BANK32,"That was when they were just startin out here and that fat fuck Ullman, he woulda hired the Boston Strangler if he’d’ve worked for minimum wage. Was a ranger from the National Park that found em; the phone was out. All of em up in the west wing on the third floor, froze solid. Too bad about the little girls. Eight and six, they was. Cute as cut-buttons. Oh, that was a hell of a mess. That Ullman, he manages some honky-tonky resort place down in Florida in the off-season, and he caught a plane up to Denver and hired a sleigh to take him up here from Sidewinder because the roads were closed—a sleigh, can you believe that? He about split a gut tryin to keep it out of the papers. Did pretty well , I got to give him that. There was an item in the Denver Post, and of course the bituary in that pissant little rag they have down in Estes Park, but that was just about all. Pretty good, considerin the reputation this place has got. I expected some reporter would dig it all up again and just sorta put Grady in it as an excuse to rake over the scandals."
B001BANK322,B001BANK32,"He saw only that his wife hated him and he felt staggered by it, all alone. He felt awful. This was what oncoming death felt like. Then she fled for the telephone and dialed the hospital with their screaming boy wedged in the crook of her arm and Jack did not go after her, he only stood in the ruins of his office, smelling beer and thinking—)

You lost your temper.

He rubbed his hand harshly across his lips and followed Watson into the boiler room. It was humid in here, but it was more than the humidity that brought the sick and slimy sweat onto his brow and stomach and legs. The remembering did that, it was a total thing that made that night two years ago seem like two hours ago. There was no lag. It brought the shame and revulsion back, the sense of having no worth at all, and that feeling always made him want to have a drink, and the wanting of a drink brought still blacker despair—would he ever have an hour, not a week or even a day, mind you, but just one waking hour when the craving for a drink wouldn’t surprise him like this?"
B001BANK323,B001BANK32,"’s face drain of color until it was like cheese, seeing his eyes, always large, grow larger still, and glassy, Jack sure the boy was going to faint dead away into the puddle of beer and papers; his own voice, weak and drunk, slurry, trying to take it all back, to find a way around that not too loud sound of bone cracking and into the past—is there a status quo in the house?—saying: Danny, are you all right? Danny’s answering shriek, then Wendy’s shocked gasp as she came around them and saw the peculiar angle Danny’s forearm had to his elbow; no arm was meant to hang quite that way in a world of normal families. Her own scream as she swept him into her arms, and a nonsense babble: Oh God Danny oh dear God oh sweet God your poor sweet arm; and Jack was standing there, stunned and stupid, trying to understand how a thing like this could have happened. He was standing there and his eyes met the eyes of his wife and he saw that Wendy hated him. It did not occur to him what the hate might mean in practical terms; it was only later that he realized she might have left him that night, gone to a motel, gotten a divorce lawyer in the morning; or called the police."
B0054LJGWS0,B0054LJGWS,"The text will be slowed down to allow the sleight of hand to be followed.

Mrs. Deirdre Young is giving birth in Delivery Room Three. She is having a golden-haired male baby we will call Baby A.

The wife of the American Cultural Attaché, Mrs. Harriet Dowling, is giving birth in Delivery Room Four. She is having a golden-haired male baby we will call Baby B.

Sister Mary Loquacious has been a devout Satanist since birth. She went to Sabbat School as a child and won black stars for handwriting and liver. When she was told to join the Chattering Order she went obediently, having a natural talent in that direction and, in any case, knowing that she would be among friends. She would be quite bright, if she was ever put in a position to find out, but long ago found that being a scatterbrain, as she’d put it, gave you an easier journey through life. Currently she is being handed a golden-haired male baby we will call the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness.

Watch carefully. Round and round they go…."
B0054LJGWS1,B0054LJGWS,"When you thought about it, Mr. Young mused, they probably saw no reason why the father should be involved anywhere.

He finished thumbing the so-called tobacco into the pipe and glared at the little sign on the wall of the waiting room that said that, for his own comfort, he would not smoke. For his own comfort, he decided, he’d go and stand in the porch. If there was a discreet shrubbery for his own comfort out there, so much the better.

He wandered down the empty corridors and found a doorway that led out onto a rain-swept courtyard full of righteous dustbins.

He shivered, and cupped his hands to light his pipe.

It happened to them at a certain age, wives. Twenty-five blameless years, then suddenly they were going off and doing these robotic exercises in pink socks with the feet cut out and they started blaming you for never having had to work for a living. It was hormones, or something.

A large black car skidded to a halt by the dustbins. A young man in dark glasses leaped out into the drizzle holding what looked like a carrycot and snaked toward the entrance.

Mr. Young took his pipe out of his mouth."
B0054LJGWS2,B0054LJGWS,"* Deirdre had run across them while being involved in one of her causes, possibly the one involving lots of unpleasant South Americans fighting other unpleasant South Americans and the priests egging them on instead of getting on with proper priestly concerns, like organizing the church cleaning rota.

The point was, nuns should be quiet. They were the right shape for it, like those pointy things you got in those chambers Mr. Young was vaguely aware your hi-fi got tested in. They shouldn’t be, well, chattering all the time.

He filled his pipe with tobacco—well, they called it tobacco, it wasn’t what he thought of as tobacco, it wasn’t the tobacco you used to get—and wondered reflectively what would happen if you asked a nun where the Gents was. Probably the Pope sent you a sharp note or something. He shifted his position awkwardly, and glanced at his watch.

One thing, though: At least the nuns had put their foot down about him being present at the birth. Deirdre had been all for it. She’d been reading things again. One kid already and suddenly she’s declaring that this confinement was going to be the most joyous and sharing experience two human beings could have. That’s what came of letting her order her own newspapers."
B0054LJGWS3,B0054LJGWS,"The only time Crowley had bought petrol was once in 1967, to get the free James Bond bullet-hole-in-the-windscreen transfers, which he rather fancied at the time.

On the back seat the thing in the basket began to cry; the air-raid siren wail of the newly born. High. Wordless. And old.

IT WAS QUITE A NICE HOSPITAL, thought Mr. Young. It would have been quiet, too, if it wasn’t for the nuns.

He quite liked nuns. Not that he was a, you know, left-footer or anything like that. No, when it came to avoiding going to church, the church he stolidly avoided going to was St. Cecil and All Angels, no-nonsense C. of E., and he wouldn’t have dreamed of avoiding going to any other. All the others had the wrong smell—floor polish for the Low, somewhat suspicious incense for the High. Deep in the leather armchair of his soul, Mr. Young knew that God got embarrassed at that sort of thing.

But he liked seeing nuns around, in the same way that he liked seeing the Salvation Army. It made you feel that it was all all right, that people somewhere were keeping the world on its axis.

This was his first experience of the Chattering Order of Saint Beryl, however."
B075ZVWM570,B075ZVWM57,"The charge nurse bustled into the room and apologized for the cramped conditions. We would be able to use her office if the patient’s bed would fit. An orderly rolled the bed down the hallway, and Koivu and I followed. Once we moved the chairs out of the way, the bed fit in between the desk and the doorway with just enough space to get the door closed.

Lady X’s face bore a withdrawn expression. I introduced myself and Koivu, and then asked her her name. She gave no reply. The who, why, and where questions yielded similar results. I began to doubt whether this young woman understood Russian after all. Maybe she was from Poland or Slovenia. I tried Finnish, Swedish, English, and German without any luck. Her brown eyes stared at the blanket, and her attractively shaped lips remained closed. After fifteen minutes of trying to get her to say something, I asked Koivu to leave the room. Maybe she was afraid of men. But one-on-one didn’t help either. Frustrated, I went to talk to the doctor.

I found the attending physician scribbling on a chart just down the hallway. He believed the girl’s wounds had been caused by an abnormally sharp, small knife."
B075ZVWM571,B075ZVWM57,"How funny that a moment of schoolgirl fancy might help with a criminal investigation nearly twenty-five years later.

Koivu drove while I tried to remember relevant vocabulary and phrases. I’d practiced Russian with the assistant coach of Iida’s figure-skating group, but terms for jumps and spins probably wouldn’t be much use in an assault interview.

The last time I’d visited Jorvi Hospital was in the fall, when we’d said good-bye to Antti’s father. That memory still brought a lump to my throat, even though Tauno Sarkela’s passing after a long illness had been a relief. To me, Jorvi meant pain and death—both of my children had been born at a birthing center away from the big city in Tammisaari.

Koivu walked briskly from the parking lot, as if he wanted to get this job over with as quickly as possible. I suddenly felt as though I couldn’t remember a single word of Russian.

The desk nurse directed us to the correct room. Our victim lay in a bed near the window. In the middle bed slept an elderly lady, and nearer the door was a woman about my age with curly hair, her leg elevated in a cast. She greeted us happily."
B075ZVWM572,B075ZVWM57,"At some point in the night Venjamin nipped at my toes.

At seven o’clock the alarm clock forced me out of bed. After our regular morning routine, I took Taneli, who was four now, to day care, and escorted Iida and her friend Saara to their second-grade classroom. There were two dangerous intersections along the way. The half-mile walk was pleasant and gave my brain some oxygen. Though March was halfway over, it was still full winter. The sun didn’t push the temperature above freezing even in the afternoon, and there was still enough snow on the ground for skiing.

In the conference room at the police station, everything was as usual. Ursula’s makeup was perfect. Puustjärvi didn’t arrive until the last minute because of the same traffic at the same intersection he always got held up at on the way from Kirkkonummi. For the umpteenth time, I wondered why he didn’t just leave home five minutes earlier. Koivu yawned and said he’d only caught a few hours of sleep in the lounge. Puupponen ate a donut. Every day he consumed an absurd amount of fat and sugar, but somehow he stayed slim. Autio had a new tie. Its blue stripes went well with his brown suit."
B075ZVWM573,B075ZVWM57,"Plus Anu Wang-Koivu was out on maternity leave, and I’d hired Ursula Honkanen for successive three-month contracts to fill in.

I curled up on the edge of the window side of our double bed. Antti ’s side was empty. His research job in Vaasa meant two nights away from home each week, but since Christmas he’d started staying there for longer stretches. He told me that his current project at the University of Vaasa was in its most interesting phase, and he had a lot of conference presentations to give since the pilot study was garnering international attention. The department of economics was attempting to model the effects of globalization on the Finnish and world economies over a fifty-year time horizon by comparing different taxation and customs regimes. Even though Antti’s specialty was category theory, he’d told me that digging into more practical mathematics was a pleasant change of pace. He felt like he was doing important work because the results could be used to direct the world’s money flows more fairly. But the meaningfulness of the work didn’t alleviate the loneliness.

When sleep finally took me, my dreams tangled Julia Roberts with this woman found bloodied in the snow."
B01A4AXM3W0,B01A4AXM3W,"It would trade only on Carter’s name, which had been recently sullied by the rift with Byrne.

And yet, because his new firm was so small, Carter was able to offer Paul something that Byrne could not: partnership. To be sure, the split Carter suggested was far from generous—60/24/16, with Paul in the minority share. And yet…at no other firm in the world would Paul have his name on the door.

Did Paul want to be Byrne’s clerk? Or Carter’s partner?

The firm of Carter, Hughes & Cravath opened its doors on January 1, 1888.

—

Of paramount importance in those early days was the matter of attracting clients. Carter mined his decades of business connections. Hughes had been helpfully engaged in some minor but long-standing litigation for the Rome, Watertown, and Ogdensburg Railroad. But Paul had nothing more to work with than a handful of school chums and a decent sales pitch. By the close of the sixth week, having failed to bring in a single dollar to the practice, Paul felt his confidence give way to disappointment. Every hour that he spent alone at that desk, in the quiet of his uselessness, revealed him to be a fraud."
B01A4AXM3W1,B01A4AXM3W,"A YEAR EARLIER, PAUL had been an eager young prodigy with one of the most coveted positions in New York law and not a single client to his name.

In the spring of ’86, weeks before his graduation from Columbia Law School, Paul had been personally recruited by the venerable Walter Carter. Paul accepted a clerkship at Carter, Hornblower & Byrne, to apprentice with Mr. Carter himself. If there existed a law student in the city who was not after such a position, Paul hadn’t met him.

Which is why it felt like the whole world was collapsing when, only months later, the firm began to dissolve. Suddenly Carter and Byrne wouldn’t even speak to each other. Paul never learned the substance of their disagreement; at that point it didn’t matter. The two split off into different firms, and Paul needed to pick a side.

Byrne took Hornblower, as well as the majority of the clients and virtually all of the prestige. If Paul followed Byrne, he’d be a clerk at arguably the best-known firm in the city.

Carter’s new firm, by contrast, was to be a two-person operation. Three, if Paul joined. Carter had partnered with an untested attorney named Charles Hughes, actually even younger than Paul but also engaged to marry Carter’s daughter. Their family firm would have no clerks. It would boast no significant clients."
B01A4AXM3W2,B01A4AXM3W,"You take a heap of coal. You heat it, filter it, pressurize it, strike a match, and voilà—a flame that will light a room. Electricity is trickier. So many different kinds of bulbs—different filaments, casings, generators, vacuums. One malfunction and we’re all thrown back into darkness. And yet the old system of power is becoming obsolete. A new one rises to take its place. Once it becomes stable—once it is perfected and ubiquitous—there won’t be a going back. Do you know, the police tell me that all manner of horrid violence decreases in public places when my lights go up? Blessed with my brightness, men’s working days are no longer bound by the setting sun. Factories double their production. Midnight and noon lose their distinction. The nighttime of our ancestors is ending. Electric light is our future. The man who controls it will not simply make an unimaginable fortune. He will not simply dictate politics. He will not merely control Wall Street, or Washington, or the newspapers, or the telegraph companies, or the million household electrical devices we can’t even dream of just yet. No, no, no. The man who controls electricity will control the very sun in the sky."
B01A4AXM3W3,B01A4AXM3W,"As with most rumors concerning Thomas Edison, Paul wasn’t sure whether to believe it.

Along the patterned walls, beautiful electric bulbs, shaped like roses, had been affixed every few feet. And dear Lord, were they ever bright.

Paul looked down at his hands. He realized that he had never actually seen his own hands under electric lights before. He could see the blue veins running underneath his skin. Freckles, pockmarks, scars, dirt, the ugly creases a man accumulates by the time he’s twenty-six. His telltale middle finger, always twitching when he was nervous. Paul felt not only that the lights were new, but that he was. A spark of the filament, and he had been revealed as something he never thought he might be.

Behind the deep mahogany desk, smoking a cigar, sat Thomas Edison.

He was more handsome than Paul had expected, thinner than he seemed in photographs, boasting a strong midwestern jaw. Even in his forties, his hair remained unkempt as a schoolboy ’s. It would make a lesser man look old; it made Edison look like he had more important things about which to care. In the harsh light, Paul could even make out the gray of his eyes."
B01H17U9OQ0,B01H17U9OQ,"His eyes rolled terribly. Yes: terribly. Or perhaps not so terribly. Perhaps they merely glanced about him, at the woman, at the bed, at the room. Growing up in the not infrequently perilous circumstances in which he had grown up, he was aware of the fragility of his body. He knew how little it took to make a man into meat: the wrong blow, the wrong gunshot, the wrong flick of a blade, turn of a car, presence of a microorganism in a handshake, a cough. He was aware that alone a person is almost nothing.

The woman who slept, slept alone. He who stood above her, stood alone. The bedroom door was shut. The window was open. He chose the window. He was through it in an instant, dropping silkily to the street below.

WHILE THIS INCIDENT was occurring in Australia, Saeed was picking up fresh bread for dinner and heading home. He was an independent-minded, grown man, unmarried, with a decent post and a good education, and as was the case in those days in his city with most independent-minded, grown men, unmarried, with decent posts and good educations, he lived with his parents."
B01H17U9OQ1,B01H17U9OQ,"The door to her closet was open. Her room was bathed in the glow of her computer charger and wireless router, but the closet doorway was dark, darker than night, a rectangle of complete darkness—the heart of darkness. And out of this darkness, a man was emerging.

He too was dark, with dark skin and dark, woolly hair. He wriggled with great effort, his hands gripping either side of the doorway as though pulling himself up against gravity, or against the rush of a monstrous tide. His neck followed his head, tendons straining, and then his chest, his half-unbuttoned, sweaty, gray-and-brown shirt. Suddenly he paused in his exertions. He looked around the room. He looked at the sleeping woman, the shut bedroom door, the open window. He rallied himself again, fighting mightily to come in, but in desperate silence, the silence of a man struggling in an alley, on the ground, late at night, to free himself of hands clenched around his throat. But there were no hands around this man’s throat. He wished only not to be heard.

With a final push he was through, trembling and sliding to the floor like a newborn foal. He lay still, spent. Tried not to pant. He rose."
B01H17U9OQ2,B01H17U9OQ,"*

AS SAEED’S EMAIL was being downloaded from a server and read by his client, far away in Australia a pale-skinned woman was sleeping alone in the Sydney neighborhood of Surry Hills. Her husband was in Perth on business. The woman wore only a long T-shirt, one of his, and a wedding ring. Her torso and left leg were covered by a sheet even paler than she was; her right leg and right hip were bare. On her right ankle, perched in the dip of her Achilles tendon, was the blue tattoo of a small mythological bird.

Her home was alarmed, but the alarm was not active. It had been installed by previous occupants, by others who had once called this place home, before the phenomenon referred to as the gentrification of this neighborhood had run as far as it had now run. The sleeping woman used the alarm only sporadically, mostly when her husband was absent, but on this night she had forgotten. Her bedroom window, four meters above the ground, was open, just a slit.

In the drawer of her bedside table were a half-full packet of birth control pills, last consumed three months ago, when she and her husband were still trying not to conceive, passports, checkbooks, receipts, coins, keys, a pair of handcuffs, and a few paper-wrapped sticks of unchewed chewing gum."
B01H17U9OQ3,B01H17U9OQ,"But today, even though the pitch was important—every pitch was important: the economy was sluggish from mounting unrest and one of the first costs clients seemed to want to cut was outdoor advertising —Saeed couldn’t focus. A large tree, overgrown and untrimmed, reared up from the tiny back lawn of his firm ’s townhouse, blocking out the sunlight in such a manner that the back lawn had been reduced mostly to dirt and a few wisps of grass, interspersed with a morning’s worth of cigarette butts, for his boss had banned people from smoking indoors, and atop this tree Saeed had spotted a hawk constructing its nest. It worked tirelessly. Sometimes it floated at eye level, almost stationary in the wind, and then, with the tiniest movement of a wing, or even of the upturned feathers at one wingtip, it veered.

Saeed thought of Nadia and watched the hawk.

When he was at last running out of time he scrambled to prepare the pitch, copying and pasting from others he had done before. Only a smattering of the images he selected had anything particularly to do with soap. He took a draft to his boss and suppressed a wince while sliding it over.

But his boss seemed preoccupied and didn’t notice."
B06XFPCVVD0,B06XFPCVVD,"This was going to be a high-profile case. That could cut both ways, of course, but he never shied away from a challenge and he felt pretty sure this one would be a winner. If anything so awful could be called a winner. Decapitation: that meant it was some sick, twisted perp, easily caught. And if she was some rich family’s daughter, it would mean priority for the lab work, allowing him to cut ahead of all the piece-of-shit cases waiting in line for the notoriously slow NYPD forensic labs.

The Evidence Gathering Team, all gowned up like surgeons, continued to work, crouching here and there, humped up and shuffling about like oversize white monkeys, sifting through the leaves one by one, examining the concrete floor of the garage, going over the door handle and windows, lifting prints from the broken glass on the floor—all by the book. They looked good, and Caruso was the best. They, too, sensed this was going to be a big case. With all the recent lab scandals they were taking extra care. And the two kids who’d found the body had been questioned right on the scene before being released to their parents. No shortcuts on this one."
B06XFPCVVD1,B06XFPCVVD,"Still the old bastard chased, screeching, with that baseball bat held high. But it seemed he was finally getting winded, dropping back a little. They turned onto another street. Up ahead Jacob could see the old shuttered automart, surrounded by a chain-link fence, where they were going to build apartments next spring. A while back, some kids had cut an opening in the fence. He dove for the opening, then crawled through, Ryan still following. Now Bascombe was really falling behind, still screeching threats.

Behind the automart was an industrial area with some dilapidated buildings. Jacob spied a nearby garage, with a peeling wooden door, and a broken window beside it. Bascombe was now out of sight. Maybe he gave up at the fence, but Jacob had a feeling the old fart was still following. They had to find a place to hide.

He tried the garage door; locked. Gingerly, he stuck his arm through the broken window, felt for the knob, turned it from the inside—and the door creaked open.

He went in, Ryan following, and carefully and quietly he shut the door and turned the bolt.

They stood there in the blackness, breathing hard, Jacob feeling like his lungs might burst, trying to stay silent."

JACOB WALKED FAST, ahead of his little brother, hands stuffed into his pockets, breath flaring in the frosty December air. His brother, Ryan, was carrying the carton of eggs they’d just purchased at the nearby deli with money Jacob had stolen from his mom ’s purse."

B00JO8PEN20,B00JO8PEN2,"Don’t remember what it was like last time when the men limped home, faces burned, missing arms and legs …

Vianne clung to her husband’s hand as Antoine bought their tickets and led them onto the train. In the third-class carriage—stiflingly hot, people packed in like marsh reeds— she sat stiffly upright, still holding her husband’s hand, with her handbag on her lap.

At their destination, a dozen or so men disembarked. Vianne and Sophie and Antoine followed the others down a cobblestoned street and into a charming village that looked like most small communes in Touraine. How was it possible that war was coming and that this quaint town with its tumbling flowers and crumbling walls was amassing soldiers to fight?

Antoine tugged at her hand, got her moving again. When had she stopped?

Up ahead a set of tall, recently erected iron gates had been bolted into stone walls. Behind them were rows of temporary housing.

The gates swung open. A soldier on horseback rode out to greet the new arrivals, his leather saddle creaking at the horse’s steps, his face dusty and flushed from heat. He pulled on the reins and the horse halted, throwing its head and snorting. An aeroplane droned overhead."
B00JO8PEN21,B00JO8PEN2,"Sophie nodded.

The three of them were silent as they left the house. They walked hand in hand up the hillside to the gray wooden barn. Knee-high golden grass covered the knoll, and lilac bushes as big as hay wagons grew along the perimeter of the property. Three small white crosses were all that remained in this world to mark the babies Vianne had lost. Today, she didn’t let her gaze linger there at all. Her emotions were heavy enough right now; she couldn’t add the weight of those memories, too.

Inside the barn sat their old, green Renault. When they were all in the automobile, Antoine started up the engine, backed out of the barn, and drove on browning ribbons of dead grass to the road. Vianne stared out the small, dusty window, watching the green valley pass in a blur of familiar images—red tile roofs, stone cottages, fields of hay and grapes, spindly-treed forests.

All too quickly they arrived at the train station near Tours.

The platform was filled with young men carrying suitcases and women kissing them good-bye and children crying.

A generation of men were going off to war. Again.

Don’t think about it, Vianne told herself."
B00JO8PEN22,B00JO8PEN2,"In the alcove that served as their wardrobe, behind a pair of gold and white toile curtains, she put on her brassiere and stepped into her lace-trimmed drawers and garter. She smoothed the silk stockings up her legs, fastened them to her garters, and then slipped into a belted cotton frock with a squared yoke collar. When she closed the curtains and turned around, Antoine was gone.

She retrieved her handbag and went down the hallway to Sophie’s room. Like theirs, it was small, with a steeply pitched, timbered ceiling, wide plank wooden floors, and a window that overlooked the orchard. An ironwork bed, a nightstand with a hand-me-down lamp, and a blue-painted armoire filled the space. Sophie’s drawings decorated the walls.

Vianne opened the shutters and let light flood the room.

As usual in the hot summer months, Sophie had kicked the coverlet to the floor sometime in the night. Her pink stuffed teddy bear, Bébé, slept against her cheek.

Vianne picked up the bear, staring down at its matted, much petted face. Last year, Bébé had been forgotten on a shelf by the window as Sophie moved on to newer toys.

Now Bébé was back.

Vianne leaned down to kiss her daughter’s cheek.

Sophie rolled over and blinked awake."
B00JO8PEN23,B00JO8PEN2,"They’d gone to university together and both had become schoolteachers. They’d even been pregnant at the same time. Now they taught in side-by-side classrooms at the local school.

Rachel appeared in the open doorway, holding her newborn son, Ariel.

A look passed between the women. In it was everything they felt and feared.

Vianne followed her friend into a small, brightly lit interior that was as neat as a pin. A vase full of wildflowers graced the rough wooden trestle table flanked by mismatched chairs. In the corner of the dining room was a leather valise, and sitting on top of it was the brown felt fedora that Rachel’s husband, Marc, favored. Rachel went into the kitchen for a small crockery plate full of canelés. Then the women headed outside.

In the small backyard, roses grew along a privet hedge. A table and four chairs sat unevenly on a stone patio. Antique lanterns hung from the branches of a chestnut tree.

Vianne picked up a canelé and took a bite, savoring the vanilla-rich cream center and crispy, slightly burned-tasting exterior. She sat down.

Rachel sat down across from her, with the baby asleep in her arms. Silence seemed to expand between them and fill with their fears and misgivings."
B07BK2GT560,B07BK2GT56,"I grab a spot at the back of the line queued up to enter the north tower at the cathedral of Notre Dame. Literally everyone is taking photos. And I’m not exaggerating. This is one of those times when literally literally applies.

Except me.

I set up an Instagram account a year ago, thinking I’d fill it with everything I longed to see in this city on that trip.

It went unused, and my shutterbug ways remained limited to the mundane, to everyday items I didn’t want to forget. The filter in my furnace so I’d remember which brand to buy. A shot of my insurance card when I renewed my license. Proof of a deposit to show the bank. My camera roll is littered with daily reminders of tasks, and only tasks.

I believe Paris is where you go to reinvent yourself.

That’s why I’m here.

To start over. To embrace life, opportunity, and beauty. And since change is the name of the game, I decide to capture what inspires me. I gaze at the spires of the cathedral, its massive archways, the sheer enormity of the fairy-tale-esque cathedral. I look at the real thing, but then, since I don’t want to forget it, I snap a photograph."
B07BK2GT561,B07BK2GT56,"It wasn’t even my dream, but I annexed it when I had to. Adopted it, if you will, when the dream’s owner died.

Then, for the final five minutes, I wandered. Contemplating.

Travel everywhere. Love the idea, but I haven’t saved quite enough yet to pull it off. I need to scrape together a little more, and with the bonus gone, I need more work.

Only I don’t have more work yet.

But here’s the thing. Bread can solve nearly every crummy situation. Nearly. That’s why I’m here at the bakery. Marie is behind the counter, wearing an orange apron that’s covered in flour. Her thick black hair is held in a hairnet.

I say hello to her in English, and she answers me back the same. It’s a running joke. The first time I came here, I was talking on the phone with a friend from home, and she greeted me in English, assuming I didn’t know her language.

She was surprised when I switched to her native tongue, which I do again right now. I order a baguette, and we chat briefly. Am I having a good day? she asks. I don’t need to unload on her, so I tell her my day is fine."
B07BK2GT562,B07BK2GT56,"I reach the bakery and open the door. The scent of fresh bread calls out to me, warm, doughy, and delicious.

I enter and inhale the lovely aromas, then take my spot in line and ogle the display case. There are apricot tarts, raspberry cakes, caramel eclairs, and bread, bread, bread. My mouth waters.

I stare at all the luscious food that’s so darn enticing I barely realize the man with the cute butt and fine jaw is standing in front of me.

When it’s his turn, he says hello to the woman at the register.

An involuntary shiver runs down my spine.

He said that in English.

And not just any English.

But British.

Griffin

I’d have kicked a rubbish bin in frustration if I were that type of guy. Instead, I gave myself fifteen minutes of drown-my-sorrows time. For the first seven, I leaned against the barricade at the river, sighed heavily, and stared glumly into the water. Then for three minutes, I opened my wallet, unfolded the piece of paper I keep in it, and reread the words imprinted on my memory.

3. Visit Indonesia. Run a marathon there. Travel across the country, then everywhere.

So , yeah. That’s been tabled."
B07BK2GT563,B07BK2GT56,"He wears a helmet. From my vantage point, perhaps fifty feet away, I can tell he’s handsome. Tall and trim, he wears dark, fitted slacks, and a light blue button-down shirt. The combination is somehow both casual and sharply dressed. He has that European look about him. Well, duh. I’m in freaking Europe. But what I really mean is— he looks like he belongs here. He has a certain ease about him. A comfort in his body and in his surroundings, in his style as a man who rides a bicycle in France. He owns this city, he knows it, and yet he doesn’t flaunt it. That’s what his easy stride and casual smile tell me, even from a distance.

When he takes off his helmet, I catch a glimpse of a chiseled jaw, and as he puts the helmet on the handlebars, I check out a rear end that would make angels weep.

I sigh happily, enjoying the Parisian view. Thank you very much, Europe, for sculpting some fine asses on your men. I’m just going to let myself savor the sight as he turns toward the door of the bakery.

Okay, savoring done. Time to savor some carbs."
B007978PKY0,B007978PKY,"The night grew ever colder. Aragorn and Gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. So the night passed. Together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until at last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The wind was in the East and all the mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light.

Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North-westward stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. Beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall Methedras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the Entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it."
B007978PKY1,B007978PKY,"As once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. Far away to the left the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. The dwellings of the Rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now hidden in mist and cloud; yet the Horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. But now all the land was empty, and there was a silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.

At dusk they halted again. Now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of Rohan and the wall of the Emyn Muil was lost in the shadows of the East. The young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled."
B007978PKY2,B007978PKY,"Every now and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread, a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. The trail led them north along the top of the escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the plain.

At the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes towards the fens of Entwash Vale far away. They seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind. Here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren places."
B007978PKY3,B007978PKY,"Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and brooded on the pale margins of the Anduin, but the sky was clear. Stars came out. The waxing moon was riding in the West, and the shadows of the rocks were black. They had come to the feet of stony hills, and their pace was slower, for the trail was no longer easy to follow. Here the highlands of the Emyn Muil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of each ridge was steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines. All night the three companions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side.

There in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. The moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. For the moment Aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished."
B01HMXRX020,B01HMXRX02,"But then, when Mahony looked around himself, everything was exactly the same. The same smeared mirrors over the same dirty seats. The same sad bastards falling into their glasses and the same smell crawling out of the gents.

Inside the envelope was a photograph of a girl with a half smile holding a blurred bundle, high and awkwardly, like found treasure. Mahony turned it over and the good solid schoolteacherly hand dealt him a left hook.

* * *

Your name is Francis Sweeney. Your mammy was Orla Sweeney. You are from Mulderrig, Co. Mayo. This is a picture of yourself and her. For your information she was the curse of the town, so they took her from you. They all lie, so watch yourself, and know that your mammy loved you.

* * *

His mammy had loved him. Past tense. Mammy was past tense.

They took her from him. Where did they take her?

Mahony turned over the photograph and studied her face. God, she looked young. He would have put her as his sister rather. She couldn’t have been more than fourteen.

And his name was Francis. He’d keep that to himself.

Mahony lit a smoke and turned to the drinker next to him."
B01HMXRX021,B01HMXRX02,"He closed his eyes and right there in his memory he found Sister Mary Margaret, as she was the last time he saw her.

* * *

He was not even seven. At first he had held back from climbing up, for fear that he would break her. But Sister Mary Margaret had smiled down at him, so he scaled the arctic landscape of the bed. Without that smile he wouldn’t have known her.

Sister Mary Margaret had a cancer the size of a man’s head in her stomach and was as good as dead under the ground. That’s what they had told him but he’d come to see for himself.

He sat next to Sister Mary Margaret and let her wipe his nose with her handkerchief although he was too old for it. It took her hours because she kept falling asleep. He had wished to God that he wasn’t trailing great lanes of snot. But Mahony always had a cold from the fact that the tops of his fingers were often blue and his socks were never quite dry.

She had looked at him with her shrunken face on one side and he’d looked back at the ridge of her eye bone."
B01HMXRX022,B01HMXRX02,"All the pigeons had their heads tucked under their wings and all the rats were curled up tight behind the dustbins. All the cars and lorries were asleep in their garages and depots, and all the trains slumbered on their tracks at Connolly Station. All the boats bobbed gently in the harbor, dreaming of the high seas, and all the bicycles slept leaning along the fences. Even the angels were asleep at the foot of the O’Connell Monument, fluttering their wings as they dreamt, quite forgetting to hold still and pretend to be statues.

The whole wide city was asleep when Sister Mary Margaret opened the door of the orphanage.

And there, on the steps, was a baby.

Of all the things in the world!

A baby in a basket, with a quilt of leaves and a pillow of rose petals.

A baby in a basket, just like Moses!

The baby had looked up at Sister Mary Margaret with two bright eyes and smiled at her. And she had smiled right back.

* * *

Mahony clung on to the bar. He couldn’t light a cigarette or pick up his pint, he couldn’t move, the sweat was pouring off him."
B01HMXRX023,B01HMXRX02,"For the dead are always close by in a life like Mahony’s. The dead are drawn to the confused and the unwritten, the damaged and the fractured, to those with big cracks and gaps in their tales, which the dead just yearn to fill. For the dead have secondhand stories to share with you, if you’d only let them get a foot in the door.

But the dead can watch. And they can wait.

For Mahony doesn’t see them now.

He stopped seeing them a long time ago.

Now the dead are confined to a brief scud across the room at lights-out, or a wobble now and then in his peripheral vision. Now Mahony can ignore them in much the same way as you’d ignore the ticks of an over-loud grandfather clock.

So Mahony pays no notice at all to the dead old woman pushing her face through the wall next to Tadhg’s right elbow. And Tadhg pays no notice either, for, like the rest of us, he is blessed with a blissful lack of vision.

The dead old woman opens a pair of briny eyes as round as vinegar eggs and looks at Mahony, and Mahony looks away, smiling full into Tadhg’s big face."
B003672JHG0,B003672JHG,"And there she was: her eighty-something-year-old mother, bundled up in blankets, sitting on the black bench in her so-called winter garden. A light snow began to fall; tiny flakes blurred the scene into an impressionistic painting where nothing looked solid enough to touch. Sculpted bushes and a single birdbath were covered in snow, giving the garden a strange, otherworldly look. Not surprisingly, her mother sat in the middle of it all, motionless, her hands clasped in her lap.

As a child it had scared Meredith—all that solitude in her mother— but as she got older it had begun to embarrass, then irritate her. A woman of her mother’s age had no business sitting alone in the cold. Her mother claimed it was because of her ruined vision, but Meredith didn’t believe that. It was true that her mother’s eyes didn’t process color — she saw only white and black and shades of gray—but that had never struck Meredith, even as a girl, as a reason for staring at nothing.

She opened the door and went out into the cold. Her boots sank in the ankle-deep snow; here and there, crusty patches crunched underneath and more than once she almost slipped."
B003672JHG1,B003672JHG,"Leave it to her mother to build something so absurdly out of place. A Russian dacha, or summerhouse, in Western Washington State. Even the orchard’s name was absurd. Belye Nochi.

White Nights indeed. The nights here were as dark as new asphalt.

Not that Mom cared about what was around her. She got her way, that was all. Whatever Anya Whitson wanted, her husband gave to her, and apparently she’d wanted a fairy-tale castle and an orchard with an unpronounceable Russian name.

Meredith knocked and went inside. The kitchen was empty; a big pot of soup simmered on the stove.

In the living room, light spilled through the two-story rounded wall of windows at the north end of the room—the famous Belye Nochi turret. Wood floors gleamed with the golden beeswax that Mom insisted on using, even though it turned the floors into a skating rink if you dared to walk in stockinged feet. A huge stone fireplace dominated the center wall; clustered around it was a grouping of richly upholstered antique sofas and chairs. Above the fireplace hung an oil painting of a Russian troika—a romantic-looking carriage drawn by matching horses—sailing through a field of snow. Pure Doctor Zhivago."
B003672JHG2,B003672JHG,"Thirteen times he’d been voted Grower of the Year and his advice was still sought out by competitors on a regular basis. It didn’t matter that he only occasionally came into the office, or that he’d been semi-retired for ten years. He was still the face of the Belye Nochi orchard, the man who had pioneered Golden Delicious apples in the early sixties, Granny Smiths in the seventies, and championed the Braeburn and Fuji in the nineties. His designs for cold storage had revolutionized the business and helped make it possible to export the very best apples to world markets.

She had had a part to play in the company’s growth and success, to be sure. Under her leadership, the cold storage warehouse had been expanded and a big part of their business was now storing fruit for other growers. She’d turned the old roadside apple stand into a gift shop that sold hundreds of locally made craft items, specialty foods, and Belye Nochi memorabilia. At this time of year—the holidays—when train-loads of tourists arrived in Leavenworth for the world-famous tree-lighting ceremony, more than a few found their way to the gift shop.

The first thing she did was pick up the phone to call her youngest daughter. It was just past ten in Tennessee."
B003672JHG3,B003672JHG,"She’d been fourteen on their first date (they’d gone to see Young Frankenstein; it was still one of their favorites), and to be honest, that was the last time she’d ever really looked at another guy. It was strange when she thought about that now; she didn’t consider herself a romantic woman, but she’d fallen in love practically at first sight. He’d been a part of her for as long as she could remember.

They’d married early—too early, really— and she’d followed him to college in Seattle, working nights and weekends in smoky bars to pay tuition. She’d been happy in their cramped, tiny U District apartment. Then, when they were seniors, she’d gotten pregnant. It had terrified her at first. She’d worried that she was like her mother, and that parenthood wouldn’t be a good thing. But she discovered, to her profound relief, that she was the complete opposite of her own mother. Perhaps her youth had helped in that. God knew Mom had not been young when Meredith was born.

Jeff shook his head. It was a minute gesture, barely even a movement, but she saw it. She had always been attuned to him, and lately their mutual disappointments seemed to create sound, like a high-pitched whistle that only she could hear."
B072HS2J830,B072HS2J83,"Fred wants to isolate the girls and me from the necessities and peculiarities of his job. I want the girls to have that kind of protection, of course, but I myself don’t want it. I can’t have it. The main reason I have come here is to shuffle Death back to the place where it belongs. That won’t happen if I never get to tangle with it. I must find a way to insert myself into the goings-on at the back of the house.

Six marble steps lead from the boulevard’s sidewalk to the entrance. A gilded sign fringed with tiny icicles and bearing the inscription Bright Funeral Home, Frederick Bright, Proprietor hangs on a brass plate from the stoop’s roof, which is a decorated affair with more of the rhubarb-colored curlicues and carvings. Just below Fred’s name are the words Deliveries to the Rear.

We step over the front door’s threshold into a foyer with a high ceiling, electric lights, a slightly faded wool carpet, and woodwork free of dust but in need of polish. A staircase carpeted in a deep scarlet leads to the second story. Double-door entrances to larger rooms beckon on either side. The foyer is warm despite the chill of the day."
B072HS2J831,B072HS2J83,"My husband could easily pass as Fred’s own offspring, and that must be a comfort to Fred now that he is in his twilight years. Thomas is a fair representative of what could have been had Fred married and fathered a son. Eli said as much to Thomas when he told his father we were leaving. Though he would miss us, Eli was happy not only for us, but also for his older brother, Fred, who would live out his remaining years with family all around him.

I’d always been able to picture Fred expertly handling the delicate affairs of the bereaved with his low, comforting voice and a gray beard that is more curls than wires. Yet now I see by the way he said what he did about the two doors that despite his affection for Thomas, he thought long and hard about offering his nephew this position. Fred had decided that while his house is indeed going to be our new home, there will be restrictions for the girls and me with regard to the business. The bit about the doors is perhaps just the first one to be mentioned. As we follow him to the front of the house, I sense within me an immediate uneasiness about these restrictions."
B072HS2J832,B072HS2J83,"If it had been in the open countryside instead of mere feet away from the apartment building next to it, the house surely would have had a wraparound porch that frothed with forsythia and beds of hyacinth and crocus in the springtime. The building next to it is so close, there is nary room for a person to pass in between them. As I look up at it from the car window, it is the most elegant house I’ve ever seen, even set against a colorless sky that hints of snow.

We turn the corner onto the side street and into a carriage shelter that sits behind the house. Fred parks the Overland next to an even blacker Cadillac, which seems as long as a city block. The funeral coach. As we get out of the Overland, I can see that the second entrance to the house has a smaller stoop than the front but a wider doorway. It is an odd shape, this second doorway, and I realize this is where the bodies are carted inside and caskets rolled out.

The driver he’d paid to bring our cases and trunks from the train station pulls into the side yard, too, and Uncle Fred tells him to unload everything on the back stoop. He explains that he has a boy from across the street coming to haul them upstairs at the noon hour."
B072HS2J833,B072HS2J83,"It isn’t always convenient to prepare the dead at home or lay them out afterward, especially when the houses and living quarters in the city are small. Fred arranged a lovely and spacious ground-floor parlor for viewing, and for embalming to take place privately in one of his back rooms, rather than at the deceased’s bedside. The business had thrived and Fred was able to pay back his friend within three years’ time. That he had done so well was only partially due to his smarts as a businessman, Fred says. There are always people needing an undertaker, even in the best of times.

It seems we’ve no sooner gotten ourselves settled inside the Overland than the three-storied house comes into view. The main entrance is on a corner of Chestnut Street—a long, busy boulevard with tall buildings, storefronts, and other homes on both sides. A secondary entrance is located around the side of the house on a slightly less active street.

The house is dove gray stone with trim the color of cream turning to butter. Scrollwork and carvings the shade of a ripe rhubarb stalk decorate the dormers and topmost gables, and stained-glass transoms in the upper-story windows glisten like gemstones."
B003IEJZRY0,B003IEJZRY,"I didn’t want to do anything but get home fast. Because I was shivering terribly now. I made it home, got to bed, the shivering replaced by fire. Helen, my superstar-shrink wife, came in from work, took one look at me, got me to New York Hospital.

All kinds of doctors came in— everybody knew something was seriously wrong, nobody had a guess as to what it might be.

I woke at four in the morning. And I knew what was wrong. Somehow, the awful pneumonia that almost killed me when I was ten—the reason my father read The Princess Bride to me in the first place was to get me through those first woeful posthospital days — well, that pneumonia had come back to finish the job.

And right then, in that hospital (and, yes, I expect this will sound nutty to you) as I woke in pain and delirium, somehow I knew that if I was to live, I had to get back to that place where I was as a child. I started yelling for the night nurse—

—because somehow my life and The Princess Bride were forever joined.

The night nurse came in and I told her to read me the Morgenstern."
B003IEJZRY1,B003IEJZRY,"The GG, you see, can make a picture happen. He (or she) is the one who releases the fifty million bucks—if your movie is aimed for Sundance. Triple that if it’s a special effects job.

Anyway, the GG at Fox liked The Princess Bride.

Problem: he wasn’t sure it was a movie. So we struck a peculiar arrangement— they would buy the book, but they would not buy the screenplay unless they decided to move forward. In other words, we both owned half the pie. So even though I was tired from finishing the abridgement, I went on nervous energy and did the screenplay immediately after.

My very great agent, Evarts Ziegler, came to town. Ziegler was the one who orchestrated the Butch Cassidy deal, which, along with The Temple of Gold, my first novel, changed my life as much as anything. We went to lunch at Lutèce, chatted, enjoyed each other, parted, me to my office on the Upper East Side in a building that had a swimming pool. I used to swim every day because I had a very bad back then, and the swimming eased things. I was heading for the pool when I realized this: I didn’t want to swim."
B003IEJZRY2,B003IEJZRY,"It was a big hit in video stores then, still is. If you have kids, you’ve probably watched it with them. Robin Wright in the title role began her film career as Buttercup, and I’m sure we all fell in love with her again in Forrest Gump. (Personally, I think she was the reason for that phenomenon. She was so lovely and warm, you just ached for poor dopey Tom Hanks to live happily with someone like that.)

Most of us love movie stories. Maybe back when Broadway held sway, people loved theater stories, but I don’t think anymore. And I’ll bet no one begs Julia Louis-Dreyfus to talk about what it was like shooting Seinfeld episode number 89. And novelist stories? Can you imagine cornering Dostoyevsky and begging him for funny stuff about The Idiot?

Anyway, these are some movie memories pertaining to The Princess Bride I thought you might not know.

I had taken time off from writing The Stepford Wives screenplay to abridge the Morgenstern. And then someone at Fox heard about it, got hold of a manuscript copy of the book, liked it, was interested in making a movie out of it. This is early ’73 we’re talking about."
B003IEJZRY3,B003IEJZRY,"Sometimes I like to fantasize that I did, that I came up with Fezzik (my favorite character), that my imagination summoned the iocane sequence, the ensuing battle of wits to the death.

Alas, Morgenstern invented it all, and I must be contented with the fact that my abridgement (though killed by all Florinese experts back in ’73—the reviews in the learned journals brutalized me; in my book-writing career, only Boys and Girls Together got a worse savaging) at least brought Morgenstern to a wider American audience.

What is stronger than childhood memory? Nothing, at least for me. I still have a recurring dream of my poor, sad father reading the book out loud—only in the dream he wasn’t poor and sad; he’d had a wonderful life, a life equal to his decency, and as he read, his English, so painful in truth, was splendid. And he was happy. And my mother so proud. . . .

But the movie is the reason we’re back together. I doubt that my publishers would have sprung for this edition if the movie hadn’t happened. If you’re reading this, dollars to donuts you’ve seen the movie. It was a mild success when it first hit theaters, but word of mouth caught up with it when the videocassette came out."
B07965H9F10,B07965H9F1,"a jack-hammering knee smashed into his privates so fast, I couldn’t count the impacts. Then a small fist with the clenched density of steel pistoned into Reddy’s throat and face like a junkyard car crusher.

Reddy fell back and almost onto the poor woman in the emergency bed one over from mine. Not sure what she was in for, but she was in a gown under the covers and was pretty much out of it.

Nope, not cool. I interceded. Reddy fell backward and stopped against a wall of nothing. Gotta give him this, his recovery time was pretty damned quick. He bounced right back up with a front kick that was so fast, Caeco’s block missed it completely. It hammered her in the gut, knocking her flying into the wall. He started to turn my way but a blur wearing a government-approved suit caught him before he got even halfway around.

Krupp and Gina came barreling in, each with a gun, which wasn’t surprising with Krupp but was with Gina. I guess once a cop, always a cop.

Reddy and junior G-girl were a spinning whirlwind of blows, kicks, and elbow strikes. It was hard to tell what was exactly happening."
B07965H9F11,B07965H9F1,"The man fell backward, body rigid, eyes staring straight up, mouth and lips drawn into a hideous, teeth-baring grin.

Students started to gather, and the driver of the pickup was helping the kicked girl get back to her feet.

More people arrived and someone pushed a cloth against my bleeding head, telling me that I was going to be all right, that head wounds always bled like crazy. I held the piece of cloth as the guy moved over to the hostage. He seemed to know what he was doing, like EMT training or something. Sirens filled the air, the sound getting louder by the second. A group of college kids gathered around the fallen assailant, cell phones out, filming away. A campus police SUV squealed to a halt, lights flashing.

Two hours later, I was still sitting in the UVM Medical Center Emergency room, trying to keep my hands away from the bandage on my forehead and finishing my statement to the police. Gina Velasquez sat near me, listening carefully as I explained that I had no idea what had happened.

The officers taking my statement had wanted her to leave but she’d produced Oracle identification that somehow stopped their demands, although they were none too happy about it."
B07965H9F12,B07965H9F1,"I lifted my left hand and shut my useless eyes. The senses I used were still new, a drunken gift from Middle Fairie. I could feel the blood on my face. I could sense the water weight of the hostage and, yes, I could feel the fluid-filled sack of crap that was the attacker.

I felt my left hand make a fist and pull. Come to me. Leave him. Come to me.

Someone screamed. I opened my eyes and wiped away as much blood as I could. The screamer was the remaining friend, as the kicked one was still on the ground. The hostage was wide-eyed but silent with shock. The attacker was frozen behind her, his own eyes wide but mostly because his eyelids and facial skin had dried up into leather. The arm holding the knife had pulled away from her neck, the bare skin of his forearm shrunken down to rawhide. He was smaller than before, lighter looking, and when the hostage girl finally grabbed his arm and pushed it away, the skin and muscle tore and it flopped away from him.

The girl fell forward and I saw the back of her hoodie was completely soaked through like she’d fallen into five inches of water."
B07965H9F13,B07965H9F1,"Standing still but almost vibrating with energy, the man was fully visible for the first time. Short and stocky, he was built like Mack, but Mack didn’t normally have lines of dried blood running down his face and into his t-shirt, and Mack couldn’t run a hundred meters in like three seconds, either. Of course, neither could I. This guy had a reddish black watch cap jammed down over his head, and it glistened in the morning sun. He held the girl without effort despite her struggles and when one of her friends tried to get close, he kicked out with lazy ease, knocking the friend flying, his eyes never leaving mine.

Enough. Twenty actions ran through my head, each discarded, one after the other. The problem was time and speed combined with the hostage being pressed right up against him. Thermal attack out, lightning ditto. Kinetic blast would hurt her. Air blade not accurate enough. A kinetic object moving at bullet speed would be great, but I had to see to hit and my eyes were filled with blood. Hmmm. Blood.

I double-checked my options, even as he bodily lifted her and started my way. Nope, nothing that wouldn’t kill her except—water. Time for something new."
B0015DWJX20,B0015DWJX2,"The women I’ve met have told me such war stories of their own, I almost wish I had my column back. Yesterday, I had a lovely, gossipy chat with a Norwich lady. She has four daughters in their teens, and just last week, the eldest was invited to tea at the cadet school in town. Arrayed in her finest frock and spotless white gloves, the girl made her way to the school, stepped over the threshold, took one look at the sea of shining cadet faces before her—and fainted dead away! The poor child had never seen so many males in one place in her life. Think of it— a whole generation grown up without dances or teas or flirting.

I love seeing the bookshops and meeting the booksellers —booksellers really are a special breed. No one in their right mind would take up clerking in a bookstore for the salary, and no one in his right mind would want to own one — the margin of profit is too small. So, it has to be a love of readers and reading that makes them do it—along with first dibs on the new books.

Do you remember the first job your sister and I had in London? In crabby Mr. Hawke’s secondhand bookshop? How I loved him—"
B0015DWJX21,B0015DWJX2,"— he left the store in a hurry.

Sidney, do you know a man named Markham V. Reynolds, Jr.? If you don’t, will you look him up for me— Who’s Who, the Domesday Book, Scotland Yard? Failing those, he may simply be in the Telephone Directory. He sent a beautiful bunch of mixed spring flowers to me at the hotel in Bath, a dozen white roses to my train, and a pile of red roses to Norwich—all with no message, only his engraved card.

Come to that, how does he know where Susan and I are staying? What trains we are taking? All his flowers have met me upon my arrival. I don’t know whether to feel flattered or hunted.

Love,

Juliet

Dear Sidney,

Susan just gave me the sales figures for Izzy— I can scarcely believe them. I honestly thought everyone would be so weary of the war that no one would want a remembrance of it—and certainly not in a book. Happily, and once again, you were right and I was wrong (it half-kills me to admit this).

Traveling, talking before a captive audience, signing books, and meeting strangers is exhilarating."
B0015DWJX22,B0015DWJX2,"I was able to un-stick my tongue from the roof of my mouth after the first two minutes and began to have quite a good time.

Susan and I are off tomorrow for bookshops in Colchester, Norwich, King’s Lynn, Bradford, and Leeds.

Love and thanks,

Dear Sidney,

Night-time train travel is wonderful again! No standing in the corridors for hours, no being shunted off for a troop train to pass, and above all, no black-out curtains. All the windows we passed were lighted, and I could snoop once more. I missed it so terribly during the war. I felt as if we had all turned into moles scuttling along in our separate tunnels. I don’t consider myself a real peeper— they go in for bedrooms, but it’s families in sitting rooms or kitchens that thrill me. I can imagine their entire lives from a glimpse of bookshelves, or desks, or lit candles, or bright sofa cushions.

There was a nasty, condescending man in Tillman’s bookshop today. After my talk about Izzy, I asked if anyone had questions. He literally leapt from his seat to go nose-to-nose with me —how was it, he demanded, that I, a mere woman, dared to bastardize the name of Isaac Bickerstaff?"
B0015DWJX23,B0015DWJX2,"I could see the Thames out of three of my windows. I know that I am fortunate to have any place at all to live in London, but I much prefer whining to counting my blessings. I am glad you thought of me to do your Elia hunting.

Yours sincerely,

Juliet Ashton

P.S. I never could make up my mind about Moses—it still bothers me.

From Juliet to Sidney

18th January, 1946

Dear Sidney,

This isn’t a letter: it’s an apology. Please forgive my moaning about the teas and luncheons you set up for Izzy. Did I call you a tyrant? I take it all back — I love Stephens & Stark for sending me out of London.

Bath is a glorious town: lovely crescents of white, upstanding houses instead of London’s black, gloomy buildings or—worse still—piles of rubble that were once buildings. It is bliss to breathe in clean, fresh air with no coal smoke and no dust. The weather is cold, but it isn’t London’s dank chill. Even the people on the street look different—upstanding, like their houses, not grey and hunched like Londoners.

Susan said the guests at Abbot’s book tea enjoyed themselves immensely— and I know I did."
B01NCWCUN10,B01NCWCUN1,"There were some very dark times that winter, but Joy never lost her will to live, and did whatever she had to do to be cured. She said afterward that she did it for Camille and Christophe, and a year later, she was cancer free, in remission, and they could all breathe again. It had been a harrowing year, and the fact that Camille had been accepted at Stanford meant nothing to any of them until after they knew that Joy was healthy again.

She and Christophe celebrated Camille’s high school graduation, and gave her a party just before school ended, on her eighteenth birthday. All was right in their world again. The party was for young people Camille’s age, mostly her classmates, and a group of parents had come to enjoy the party with Joy and Christophe. The Marshalls were there and they said Phillip was traveling constantly now, working on promoting their wines and doing well. He had spent six months in Chile, working at a friend’s winery, and he had been in Cape Town the year before, since both were grape-growing regions often compared to the Napa Valley. He was learning the business all around the world."
B01NCWCUN11,B01NCWCUN1,"Like her father, she didn’t want to live in France, and Joy agreed with both of them. The Marshalls remained their closest friends, and Phillip alternated between being Camille’s nemesis and her hero as he grew up. Seven years older than she was, he teased her a lot. He was a senior in high school when she was only ten. But more than once, he had protected her if he saw anyone bullying her when he was around. She was like a little sister to him and she was sad when he went away to college and she only saw him during vacations after that.

—

Joy was forty-four, and Christophe a year older, the summer Camille turned seventeen, when Joy discovered she had breast cancer in a routine mammogram, and it rocked their world. The doctors decided to remove only the lump and not the breast, and thought they could cure her with aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for a year. Christophe was beside himself, and Joy was desperately ill after her treatments, but she went to the winery for a short time every day, and Camille did everything she could to help her. Joy was incredibly courageous, and determined to beat the dreaded disease."
B01NCWCUN12,B01NCWCUN1,"They kept to themselves, gave elaborate parties within the confines of their elite group, and snubbed everyone, although they occasionally acknowledged the more important vintners, including Christophe, who had no interest in them.

Camille grew up in the happy atmosphere her parents created around them, among the wine-making dynasties in the Napa Valley, and a few close friends. Their land grew as her father bought more of it, planted more vineyards, and added an Italian vineyard manager named Cesare, from Tuscany, whom Camille knew her mother didn’t like, because she made a face every time he walked into the office or left the room.

Joy had continued to take care of the business end of the winery as Camille grew up, and hung out around the winery or played in the vineyards after school. And she always said she wanted to be like her mother and father and work at their winery one day, and go to Stanford just like them. She thought everything they did was perfect, and she wanted to continue in the same traditions. She’d been to Bordeaux many times with her parents, to meet her cousins and great-uncles and aunts, but she loved being in the Napa Valley, and thought it was the most beautiful place on earth."
B01NCWCUN13,B01NCWCUN1,"He didn’t have Christophe’s history or knowledge of French viticulture, but he had an instinctive sense for growing great wines, was brave and innovative, and owned more land than anyone else in the Valley, and Christophe liked exchanging ideas with him.

His wife, Barbara, and Joy were friends too, and the two couples often spent time together with their children, on weekends. The Marshalls had a little boy who was seven years old when Camille was born. Phillip was fascinated by the baby when the two families had lunch together on Sundays. Christophe would cook a big French meal for them, while he and Sam talked business and the women watched the children. Joy let Phillip hold Camille when she was two weeks old. But most of the time he preferred climbing trees, or running around the fields, picking fruit in the orchards, or riding his bike in their driveway.

Sam Marshall had been a local boy who had worked hard for everything he had and took his business seriously, as Christophe did, which Sam admired him for. It had always annoyed Sam when successful businessmen from the city, or as far away as LA, or even New York, bought a piece of property, planted a few vines, called themselves vintners and winemakers, showed off without any real knowledge, and were pretentious about it."
B074ZKXGM40,B074ZKXGM4,"In Switzerland, it was high in the sky all year round, but tonight I couldn’t even find it. Then I remembered that Google also said it was harder to see the farther south you went. I gazed heavenward and thought how sad it was that we weren’t kids anymore, and that we could discover the truth by pressing a few keys on a computer.

But tonight, I decided, I would believe in magic. I fixed my gaze on the brightest star I could find and thought of Atlantis. Besides, even if Christmas wasn’t celebrated in Buddhist culture, Thailand still made an attempt for its international guests by hanging up tinsel and foil banners, which at least put everyone in a good mood.

Just before midnight, I wandered out of the noisy bar and walked down toward the rocks to get the best view of the full moon. And there, already standing in the shadows, was the mystery man —once again in the dark, and once again alone. I felt really irritated because I wanted this moment to be special and to have the space to myself, so I turned tail and walked away from him. Then, when I was far enough away, I looked up and spoke to my sister."
B074ZKXGM41,B074ZKXGM4,"Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a solitary figure standing at the water’s edge near the rocks, staring up at the moon. It was the guy from a couple of weeks ago who’d woken me up on the beach. As I hadn’t seen him since, and because Railay was such a small community, I’d presumed he’d left. But here he was, alone again in the dark of night. Maybe he didn’t want to be seen . . .

I watched him for a while to see where he went, but he didn’t move for ages, and I got bored, so I went inside and lay down on the bed to try to sleep. Whoever he was, I just knew he was as lonely as me.

On Christmas Eve—which just happened to be a full moon to boot — I automatically did what Star and I used to do every year with our sisters, and looked up into the night sky to search for the bright, magical star that Pa always told us was the Star of Bethlehem. I’d once Googled the star he’d pointed to and, with Ally’s help, discovered that it was in fact the North Star—Polaris."
B074ZKXGM42,B074ZKXGM4,"Lastly, I want to tell you how much I love you, my strong, determined adventurer. Never stop searching, CeCe, for both inspiration and peace, which I pray will come to you eventually.

Pa Salt x

Pa had been right about one thing— it had taken me almost an hour to read the letter and decipher every single word. Yet he was wrong about something else — I had almost cried. I’d sat up in that tree for a long time, until I’d realized that my backside was numb, and my legs had got pins and needles, so I’d had to climb down.

By the grace of God, I am who I am, had been the quotation he’d had engraved onto the armillary sphere. Given that—both then and now—I actually had no idea who I was, it hadn’t inspired me, only depressed me further.

When I’d been to see Georg Hoffman in his Geneva office the next morning, he’d said that Star couldn’t come in with me, so she’d had to wait outside in reception. He’d then told me about my inheritance and handed me an envelope containing a black and white photograph of an older man standing with a teenage boy by a pickup truck."
B074ZKXGM43,B074ZKXGM4,"As you will already have seen, I have left you girls an armillary sphere in my special garden. Under each of your names is a set of coordinates that will tell you exactly where I found you. There is also a quotation, which I hope you feel is apt. I certainly do.

In addition, I urge you to go and see my dear friend and lawyer Georg Hoffman as soon as you can. Don’t worry, what he has to tell you is very good news, and in itself provides a link with your past that will be enough to send you on your way if you want to discover more about your birth family. If you do take the leap, I’d advise you to find out about a woman called Kitty Mercer, who lived in Broome on the northwestern coast of Australia. It was she who began your story.

I realize that you have often felt overshadowed by your sisters. It is vital that you don’t lose faith in yourself. Your talent as an artist is unique— you paint as your imagination demands. And once you have found the confidence to trust in it, I am sure you will fly."
B00CQZ6EKW0,B00CQZ6EKW,"The car in front of Sookie moved one space closer to the teller, and she moved up with it. She looked at herself in the mirror again. She looked a little better with her makeup on, but, of course, she had forgotten to put on her earrings. Honestly, between the weddings and dealing with her mother, it really was a miracle she was still sane at all.

She had always had a delicate nervous system and a tendency to faint under pressure. And it was very stressful never knowing what her mother was going to do next. Lenore had shown up at Ce Ce’s wedding wearing a large yellow hat with two live lovebirds in a cage sitting on top. God only knows where she got that.

Thank heavens, all Sookie’s kids had been good kids, because when they were growing up, she had let them do pretty much what they pleased. She had wanted them to have a carefree childhood. Hers certainly hadn’t been, with Lenore pushing her into everything. She had always been basically shy. She never wanted to be a Magnolia Trail Maiden or a cheerleader or to join all those organizations. But she had had no choice. Lenore ruled with an iron hand."
B00CQZ6EKW1,B00CQZ6EKW,"First, to proudly carry on the Simmons family line that, according to Lenore, could be traced all the way back to fifteenth-century England. Second, to protect the family silver.

It was such a beautiful warm day, and after Sookie left her mother’s house, she took her shoes off and walked back home along the bay. As she strolled along, she suddenly wondered how many times she and the children had walked back and forth to Lenore’s house over the years. It seemed like only yesterday when all day long, the kids were running back and forth to her house and theirs.

Time was so strange. When the children were younger, she used to marvel at the tiny little footsteps they left in the sand, but those days were gone forever. They were all grown up now … and, bless their hearts, not a one of them had the Simmons foot, and three had the Poole ears. But that was another story.

A FEW MINUTES LATER, after she had thrown on a little makeup, Sookie drove back to town and was sitting in line at the drive-in bank waiting to make a deposit to cover yet another one of Lenore’s unexpected expenses. About ten years ago, Lenore had suddenly started bouncing checks all over town and hadn’t seemed the least bit concerned."
B00CQZ6EKW2,B00CQZ6EKW,"It was a long-distance call, but not from an area code she recognized, so she just let it ring. She was too tired to talk to anyone if she didn’t have to. In the past few days she’d had to smile and talk to so many people that her face still hurt.

Sookie stuck a cup of water in the microwave, grabbed her tea bag, and went out on the screened-in porch to enjoy it. She sat down in her big white wicker chair. The bay was as smooth as glass, not a ripple in sight.

She noticed that her gardenia bushes were still in bloom and thought she might cut off a few and float them in a dish in the living room. They always made the house smell so sweet. She took a deep breath of fresh air and was about to have her first sip of tea when the phone started ringing again. Oh, Lord, it was obviously somebody calling the wrong number or a solicitor trying to sell her something, and if she didn’t answer they would probably drive her crazy all day. She got up and went back to the kitchen and picked up. It was her mother."
B00CQZ6EKW3,B00CQZ6EKW,"When the kids had been much younger, she and Earle used to go sit there almost every evening to watch the sunset and listen to the church bells that rang up and down the bay. They hadn’t done that in years. She was so looking forward to being alone with Earle again.

Sookie took the two bags of seeds out of the car and put them in the little greenhouse Earle had built for her, where she kept her bird supplies. A few minutes later, after she went inside, Sookie suddenly noticed how quiet the house was. Almost eerily quiet. As she stood there, all she could hear was the ticking of the kitchen clock and the cry of the seagulls out on the bay. It was so strange not to hear a door slamming or someone running up and down the stairs. How pleasant to have peace and quiet, and not hear loud music blaring from someone’s room. So pleasant, in fact, she thought maybe she would fix herself a cup of tea and sit and relax a few minutes before she headed out again.

Just as she was reaching for a tea bag, the kitchen phone rang. Now that the house was empty, it sounded like a fire alarm going off. She picked it up and looked at the caller ID number."
B01NCUXEFR0,B01NCUXEFR,"The week before, I closed a nice adoption at my alma mater, and I was in the running for one at Georgia State. It didn’t make me a mogul, but I was looking forward to a bonus hefty enough to start talking about buying a new house. Nothing was wrong with our current abode, a solid ranch house on a quiet street. It’s just that it was a wedding gift from her parents, her childhood home, deeded over to their only daughter, and only to her. It was like white people do, a leg up, American style. But I kind of wanted to hang my hat on a peg with my own name on it.

This was on my mind but not on my spirit as we drove up I-10 on our way to Eloe. We settled down after our anniversary skirmish and we were back in rhythm with each other. Old-school hip-hop thumped from the stereo of our Honda Accord, a family kind of car with two empty seats in the back.

Six hours in, I clicked on the blinker at exit 163. As we merged onto a two-lane highway, I felt a change in Celestial. Her shoulders rode a little higher, and she nibbled on the ends of her hair."
B01NCUXEFR1,B01NCUXEFR,"I’m into the museum-quality marbles and the delicate line drawings, but the dolls were something that an ordinary person could get behind. My vision was a line of cloth dolls that we were going to sell wholesale. You could display them on a shelf or hug the stuffing out of them. There would still be the high-end custom jobs and art pieces. Those could fetch five figures, easy. But the everyday dolls were going to make her mark, I told her. And you see, I turned out to be right.

I know that all of this is water under the bridge, and not a sweet little creek either. But to be fair, I have to tell this whole story. We were married only a year and some change, but it was a good year. Even she would have to admit that.

A meteor crashed our life on Labor Day weekend when we went to Eloe to visit my parents. We traveled by car because I liked a road trip. Planes, I associated with my job. Back then, I was a rep for a textbook company, specializing in math books, even though my way with numbers ended with my 12 times tables. I was successful at my gig because I knew how to sell things."
B01NCUXEFR2,B01NCUXEFR,"But as a witness to, and even a member of, our relationship, I’m convinced that it was the opposite. It meant something that I could make her mad with just a scrap of paper and she could make me crazy with just a rubber.

Yes, we were a married couple, but we were still young and smitten. One year in and the fire was still burning blue hot.

The thing is this: it’s a challenge being 2.0. On paper, we’re A Different World: Where Are They Now? Whitley and Dwayne all grown up. But Celestial and me are something Hollywood never imagined. She was gifted and I was her manager and muse. It’s not like I lay around in my birthday suit so she could draw me. No, I simply lived my life and she watched. When we were engaged, she won a competition for a glass sculpture she created. From a distance, it looked to be a shooter marble, but when you got up close and looked from the right angle, you could make out the lines of my profile swirled inside. Somebody offered her five thousand dollars for it, but she wouldn’t part with it. This isn’t what happens when a marriage is in danger.

She did for me and I did for her in return."
B01NCUXEFR3,B01NCUXEFR,"I didn’t even know they had shit like that, but I pretended to be all about it when Celestial showed me the brochure, telling her it was on my bucket list. There we were, relaxing up over the ocean, enjoying each other. The wedding was more than a day behind us because Bali was twenty-three first-class hours away. For the wedding, Celestial had been done up like a doll-baby version of herself. All that crazy hair was wrangled into a ballerina bun and the makeup made her seem to blush. When I saw her floating down the aisle toward me, her and her daddy both were giggling like this whole thing was only a dress rehearsal. There I was, serious as four heart attacks and a stroke, but then she looked up at me and puckered her pink-paint lips in a little kiss and I got the joke. She was letting me know that all of this—the little girls holding up the train of her gown, my morning jacket, even the ring in my pocket—was just a show. What was real was the dance of light in her eyes and the quick current of our blood. And then I smiled, too.

In Bali, that slick hair was long gone and she was rocking a 1970s Jet magazine fro and wearing nothing but body glitter."
B071GYV5D40,B071GYV5D4,"My bullshit detector, honed to perfection by my former boss, quivered like a flagpole in the wind.

My reservations aside, Lukas jumped into action and, in a move of complete optimism, leased a new space with a conference room and parking lot, hoping to bring in some bigger clients. It worked. In addition to beefing up our local roster, we scored an Italian gelato company eager to break into the American market, a nationally distributed brand of caramel-cheese popcorn, a company dedicated to 100 percent eco-friendly paint, and an ancient cast-iron cookware company looking to ditch their stodgy image. I smiled to think of Big Frank’s reaction to our success. He would have been proud.

It wasn’t until a few weeks later that I was able to identify why my bullshit detector had gone off. Jackie and I sat on the fire escape silently sharing a sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mints. Lost in thought, I remembered Lukas’s first afternoon. With all the talk of honoring Big Frank and his vision and keeping clients happy, Lukas hadn’t said a thing about doing right by us.

When I arrived at work, sweating through my gray suit, the first sign that something was awry was an actual sign."
B071GYV5D41,B071GYV5D4,"Big Frank’s genes came through in ways Frank, Jr. tried to hide, his hair carefully disheveled to disguise a premature bald spot, silver rings to dress up Sicilian workingman’s hands, a laugh that seemed too hearty for his body. These ghosts of Big Frank had me nodding my head in agreement when Frank, Jr. enthusiastically vowed to make the changes his father had only dreamed of. I never thought Big Frank was much of a dreamer; he was a doer. But if his son had both qualities, Giacomo might survive.

I’d met Frank, Jr. a few times over the years, and it was hard to see him as something other than a kid, until he held a staff meeting with his nervous employees: me; Jackie, the shy, acid-washed-jeans-wearing designer who had been at Giacomo even longer than I had, and a random collection of young designers Big Frank hired when he decided to expand the company after we had a good run—Rhiannon, Seth, Byron, and the timid, newest hire, Glynnis.

On Frank, Jr. ’s first day, we had assembled in Big Frank’s office, where the walls still exuded cigar smoke. Frank, Jr. held his hands in a namaste style and seemed at a loss for words. He motioned for us to come closer."
B071GYV5D42,B071GYV5D4,"Frank usually called midday to see how he was doing.

Last Christmas, at our annual company party in the back room of Marinetti’s Chop House, Frank excused himself and never came back. He was found slumped in a bathroom stall, cigar still lit. They had to unclench his jaw to get it out. Frank’s heart, as big as the rest of him, had simply worked too hard.

Jesse had only been gone a year, and I’d never had to grieve a father —my own was gone long before tangible memories — so Frank’s death sucker punched me. I felt Jesse’s absence more acutely. Most of Frank’s employees drifted as the company slid into uncertainty, but I stayed on. With both Jesse and Frank gone, even the spare remains of Frank’s company offered some bit of stability.

So Giacomo Advertising and Design survived, helmed by Frank ’s only son, Frank, Jr., a graduate of a small, private university on the East Coast who’d worked a series of vague internships in New York. He carried the city in with him when he walked into the Giacomo offices two weeks after Big Frank’s death—skinny jeans and a black leather jacket, expensive sunglasses, and a disdainful expression."
B071GYV5D43,B071GYV5D4,"Frank Giacomo hired me seventeen years ago, when I was both a recent grad with no experience and a new mom (also with no experience). He took me on anyway. Short and round, always chomping on a cigar and wearing more gold around his neck than a rap star, Frank was a secret feminist, and he filled his office with smart, talented women. The vast majority of our clients were local, as Frank wasn’t ambitious in the traditional sense. Frank appealed to me because he liked stability, and he appealed to his clients because he had an old-school method of holding their interest— he wined and dined them, asked about their spouses and kids and tennis games, sent them gift baskets at Christmas, and paid his respects when one of them passed on. Everybody liked Frank, because Frank had that one quality no one could resist— he knew who he was and still liked himself.

Our office used to sit above a dental office on Wright Street, beige and bland, nine cubicles in a row, and a cramped, windowless room for Frank. It didn’t matter. Every year I got a raise, and I never worried about losing my job. When I needed a vacation, I took one. When Trey got sick, I stayed home with him."
B00GET18P20,B00GET18P2,"He couldn’t remember what it said in her file, but Control thought she was probably almost as tall as him. She had been held in the eastern wing of the building for two weeks now, with nothing to do but eat and exercise.

Before going on the expedition, the biologist had received intense survival and weapons training at a Central facility devoted to that purpose. She would have been briefed with whatever half-truths the Southern Reach’s command and control deemed useful, based on criteria Control still found arcane, even murky. She would have been subjected to conditioning to make her more receptive to hypnotic suggestion.

* * *

The psychologist/director would have been given any number of hypnotic cues to use—words that, in certain combinations, would induce certain effects. Passing thought as the door shut behind Control : Had the director had anything to do with muddying their memories, while they were still in Area X?

Control slid into a chair across from the biologist, aware that Grace, at the very least, watched them through the one-way glass. Experts had questioned the biologist, but Control was also a kind of expert, and he needed to have the direct contact. There was something in the texture of a face-to-face interview that transcripts and videotape lacked."
B00GET18P21,B00GET18P2,"Things that showed themselves in the empty spaces, making Control unwilling to say her words aloud for fear that somehow he did not really understand the undercurrents and hidden references. A detached description of a thistle … A mention of a lighthouse. A sentence or two describing the quality of the light on the marshes in Area X. None of it should have gotten to him, yet he felt her there, somehow, looking over his shoulder in a way not evoked by the interviews with the other expedition members.

The biologist claimed to remember as little as the others.

Control knew that for a lie—or it would become a lie if he drew her out. Did he want to draw her out? Was she cautious because something had happened in Area X or because she was just built that way? A shadow had passed over the director’s desk then. He’d been here before, or somewhere close, making these kinds of decisions before, and it had almost broken him, or broken through him. But he had no choice.

About seven hundred words after she came back. Just like the other two. But unlike them, that was roughly comparable to her terseness before she had left. And there were the odd specifics that the others lacked."
B00GET18P22,B00GET18P2,"Had no one cared about her? Had she made a convincing case? The Voice hadn’t said. The maddeningly incomplete files on her told Control nothing.

Everything in what he saw showed that she had cared, and yet that she had cared not at all about the functioning of the agency.

Nudging his knee on the left, under the desk: the hard drive for the monitor. He wondered if that had stopped working back in the nineties, too. Control had the feeling he did not want to see the rooms the hardware techs worked in, the miserable languishing corpses of the computers of past decades, the chaotic unintentional museum of plastic and wires and circuit boards. Or perhaps the fish did rot from the head, and only the director had decomposed.

So, sans computer, his own laptop not yet deemed secure enough, Control had done a little light reading of the transcripts from the induction interviews with the members of the twelfth expedition. The former director, in her role as psychologist, had conducted them.

The other recruits had been uncappable, unstoppable geysers in Control’s opinion: Great chortling, hurtling, cliché-spouting babblers. People who by comparison could not hold their tongues … 4,623 words …"
B00GET18P23,B00GET18P2,"Control had immediately taken a seat behind the battering ram of a desk, among the clutter of piles and piles of folders, the ramble of handwritten notes and Post-its … in the swivel chair that gave him such a great panoramic view of the bookcases against the walls, interspersed with bulletin boards overlaid with the sediment of various bits of paper pinned and re-pinned until they looked more like oddly delicate yet haphazard art installations. The room smelled stale, with a slight aftertaste of long-ago cigarettes.

Just the size and weight of the director’s computer monitor spoke to its obsolescence, as did the fact that it had died decades ago, thick dust layered atop it. It had been halfheartedly shoved to the side, two shroud-shadows on the calendar blotter beneath describing both its original location and the location of the laptop that had apparently supplanted it—although no one could now find that laptop. He made a mental note to ask if they had searched her home.

The calendar dated back to the late nineties; was that when the director had started to lose the thread? He had a sudden vision of her in Area X with the twelfth expedition, just wandering through the wilderness with no real destination: a tall, husky, forty-year-old woman who looked older. Silent, conflicted, torn. So devoured by her responsibility that she’d allowed herself to believe she owed it to the people she sent into the field to join them. Why had no one stopped her?"
B075VVRTJ70,B075VVRTJ7,"I’d adopted him when he was only six weeks old. Now he was four, but I swear, he still acted like a puppy, loved to be held.

My boy was a good-sized dog, a Labrador/terrier mix—plus some other stuff, I was sure— so the best kind of dog, with the best personality traits from each breed in his ancestry. Smart, friendly, gentle and patient with kids. I was convinced that dog had a sixth sense about things, especially people.

For example, Wally didn’t like Seamus. Every time he’d come around, Wally would growl and bark, didn’t want Seamus touching him.

He knew my brother was a nasty fucker. You could tell a lot about a person based on how they interacted with animals. I didn’t trust people who didn’t like dogs; they’re not my people. How could you dislike dogs? They’re the best fucking thing about this planet, with hockey, sex, and a good Irish whiskey taking places two, three, and four.

Plus, dogs were loyal. There’s nothing more loyal than a dog. Probably because they had their priorities straight: food, sleep, and chasing shit.

But enough about my awesome dog, for now.

Unbuttoning the right cuff of my suit shirt, I strolled into the main room."
B075VVRTJ71,B075VVRTJ7,"Me moving home to Boston and buying a house on her street.

Me going to stay for every major holiday for the rest of my life.

Me asking her advice about every major decision for the rest of my life.

Four of the five weren’t possible. They just weren’t. The first three because they were impossible for me to do within the next twenty-four hours, and the last one wasn’t going to happen because I wasn’t a helpless asshole.

Number four would have to do it. I’d pledge at least five years of holidays as penance. So be it.

Plus, I was going to have to make up a lie about why I hadn’t called yet, and it was going to have to be good. If I told her the truth, that I’d forgotten, it would legitimately hurt her feelings. There was nothing I wouldn’t do—including lie, cheat, and steal—to avoid hurting my mom ’s feelings.

Getting on the elevator, I pressed the button for my floor and leaned against the cushioned velvet wall, tired. So damn tired. I couldn’t wait to sleep in my own bed.

But first things first. I’d apologize to Steven and then spend some time with Wally while I called my mom."
B075VVRTJ72,B075VVRTJ7,"My father’s family hadn’t been any more or less dysfunctional than my own, and none of us had chosen the polyamorous lifestyle. My brother had, but it was different. He just dicked around with a bunch of different crazy women who didn’t know he was dicking around; not the same thing as a consensual committed relationship with a bunch of different sane people.

But that kind of lifestyle wasn’t for me. Knowing myself as I do, I wouldn’t be able to stomach seeing some other guy or lady touching the woman I loved. Furthermore, I’d probably beat the shit out of that other guy.

I wouldn’t beat the shit out of the lady, though. Likely, I’d give her a seriously dirty look.

But that’s just me.

So , yeah. I saw Kat this afternoon after not talking to her for six months. Seeing her reinforced the fact that she was still a goddamn diamond, and she still gave me that shitty feeling in my chest. We’d talked briefly. As usual, she couldn’t wait to get away from me. Afterward, I’d been distracted and irritable, and I hadn’t called my mom on her birthday.

Quinn’s smile spread. He tried to hide it by clearing his throat and covering his mouth with a fist."
B075VVRTJ73,B075VVRTJ7,"So what if I grew up on the other side of the tracks? So what if I was in and out of jail and gangs when I was a teenager? So what if I have a GED instead of a high school diploma? So what if I never went to college, and meanwhile she’d gone to the University of Chicago for some fancy degree?

People were just people when you got down to it, right? No biggie.

But then I woke up next to her one morning in Las Vegas, after holding her hair the night before while she threw up, only for her to tell me she’s not into monogamy.

For the record, I had nothing against polyamory. I had an aunt on my dad’s side who lived up on a compound in Vermont. Aunt Becks had, like, three lady friends and six gentleman friends — that’s what my mom called them—something like that. They all seemed to get on just fine with each other for the most part. Shit, she’d lived there for twenty years and she’d always seemed happy.

When I was old enough to understand her lifestyle wasn’t typical, I’d asked her why she was into it."
B01M14UN1J0,B01M14UN1J,"But I don’t know the strange, sharp language Queenie learned from the family she left behind when she ran off to the river with Briny. The few Polish words I have would be a mouthful of nonsense if I strung them together. Even so, if I could grab Queenie’s cross in my hand just now, I’d say them to the tin man Queenie kisses when the storms come.

I’d try pretty near anything to help get the birthing over with and see Queenie smile again.

On the other side of the door, Briny’s boot scrapes the planks, and I hear the cross clatter over the floor. Briny looks out the cloudy window that came from the farmhouse he tore down to build the boat before I was ever born. With Briny’s mama on her deathbed and the crops droughted out for another year, the banker was gonna get the house anyway. Briny figured the river was the place to be. He was right too. Time the Depression hit, him and Queenie were living just fine on the water. Even the Depression can’t starve the river, he says every time he tells the story. The river’s got her own magic. She takes care of her people. Always will."
B01M14UN1J1,B01M14UN1J,"Truth told, it probably wouldn’t hurt her if she tumped over. It’d teach her a lesson. The boat’s tied up in a nice little backwater across the river from Mud Island. The water is only hip deep on me off the Arcadia’s stern. Fern might could touch the bottom on her tiptoes, but all five of us swim like pollywogs anyhow, even little Gabion, who can’t talk a full sentence yet. When you’re born on the river, you take to it as natural as drawing breath. You know its sounds and its ways and its critters. For river rats like us, the water’s a homeplace. A safe place.

But something’s in the air just now…something that’s not right. A spat of gooseflesh runs up my arms and needles my cheeks. There’s always been a knowing in me. I’d never tell a living soul of it, but it’s there just the same. A chill settles through me in the airless summer night. Overhead, the sky is thick, and the clouds are ripe as melons fair to bursting. There’s a storm coming, but what I feel is something more than that.

Inside the shanty, Queenie’s soft groans come faster now, mindless of the midwife woman’s molasses-thick voice:"
B01M14UN1J2,B01M14UN1J,"I’ve gone even further back. It’s Queenie I see.

Queenie, our strong mama, who marked all of us with her lovely golden curls. All but poor Camellia.

My mind skitters featherlight across treetops and along valley floors. I travel all the way to a low-slung Mississippi riverbank to the last time I saw Queenie. The warm, soft air of that Memphis summer night swirls over me, but the night is an impostor.

It is not soft. It does not forgive.

From this night, there will be no returning.

Twelve years old, still thin and knobby as a front porch post, I dangle my legs under the rail of our shantyboat, watching for a gator ’s eyes to catch the amber flicker of lantern light. Gators shouldn’t stray this far upwater on the Mississippi, but there’s been gossip about sightings around here lately. This makes looking for them a game of sorts. Shantyboat kids take their entertainment where they can find it.

Right now, we need a distraction worse than usual.

Beside me, Fern climbs the rail and searches the woods for fireflies. At nearly four years old, she’s learning to count them. She points a stubby finger and leans out, mindless of gators."
B01M14UN1J3,B01M14UN1J,"He has work to do yet, and after that, my parents deserve a retirement with quietly passing seasons and time to spend together.

A tender feeling settles in my chest, and I push away these thoughts. No overwhelming displays of emotion in public—Leslie’s frequent reminder. Women can’t afford it in this arena. It’s seen as incompetence, weakness.

As if I didn’t know that already. A courtroom isn’t much different. Female lawyers are always on trial in more ways than one. We have to play by different rules.

My father salutes Frank as they meet near the podium. The man stops, straightens, and returns the gesture with military precision. Their gazes meet, and the moment is pure. It may look perfect on camera, but it’s not for the camera. My father’s lips press into a tight line. He’s trying not to tear up.

It isn’t like him to come so close to letting it show.

I swallow another swell of emotion. A breath shudders past my lips. I press my shoulders back, turn my eyes away, and focus on the window, studying the woman in the garden. She’s still standing there, gazing off. Who is she? What is she looking for?"
B071Y37P870,B071Y37P87,"She insisted that her children wear blue for protection and carry packets of lavender in their pockets, though Franny always threw the packets away the minute she was out of her mother’s sight.

They began to wonder if their mother wasn’t a spy. Russia was the enemy, and at Starling students were often made to crouch beneath their desks, hands over their heads, for bomb-safety drills. Spies had no family connections and dubious histories, just as their mother had, and they spoke in double-talk, as she did. They fudged their histories to protect their true backgrounds and intentions, and Susanna never mentioned attending college nor did she discuss where she grew up or reveal anything about her parents, other than claiming they had died young while on a cruise. The Owens children knew only the slimmest facts: Susanna had grown up in Boston and been a model in Paris before settling down with the children’s father, who was an orphan with no family of his own. Their mother was terribly chic at all times, wearing black and gold sunglasses even on cloudy days, and lavish designer clothes from Paris, and she always wore Chanel No. 5 perfume, so that every room she was in was deliciously scented."
B071Y37P871,B071Y37P87,"While therapy was in progress, Vincent often sneaked down to the coat closet to search a patient’s pockets for cash, mints, and Valium. Then all three children would lie on the kitchen floor, relaxed by the little yellow pills Vincent had found, sucking on Brach’s Ice Blue mints as they listened in to the sobbing confessions that filtered up through the heating vent. Due to these eavesdropping sessions they knew about obsessions, depressions, manias, sexual appetites, and transference long before most people their age knew what a psychiatrist was.

Every year a box of lavender-scented black soap wrapped in crinkly cellophane would arrive from Massachusetts. Susanna refused to say who the sender was, yet she faithfully washed with it. Perhaps that was why she had such a creamy, radiant complexion. Franny discovered the potential of the soap after she nicked a bar one Christmas. When she and Jet sampled it, the soap caused their skin to shine, but it also made them so silly they couldn’t stop laughing. They filled the sink with bubbles and splashed water at each other and were soon soaked to the skin. When their mother found them throwing the slippery bar of soap back and forth like a hot potato, she snatched it from their grasp."
B071Y37P872,B071Y37P87,"After the incident in the kitchen, the table was always tilted, with plates and glasses tending to slide off the top, as if to remind them that whoever they were, whatever their history might be, Vincent had been correct. They were not like anyone else.

None of this experimentation would have pleased Dr. and Mrs. Burke-Owens, had they known of such games. They were elegant, serious people who spent evenings out nursing a Tom Collins or whiskey sour at the Yale Club, for after receiving his B.A. at Harvard, the doctor had attended medical school in New Haven, a town their mother admitted she hoped never to visit again. They were both constantly on the lookout for signs of hereditary malfunctions in their offspring, and so far they were not especially hopeful. In his writings, Dr. Burke-Owens proposed a theory of personality that placed nature over nurture, stating there was no way to change a child’s core personality. Not only was the brain hardwired, he proposed, but the soul was as well. There was no way to escape one’s personal genetics, despite a healthy environment, and this did not bode well for Frances and Bridget and Vincent.

Luckily for them, their father was preoccupied with his patients, who furtively made their way inside through a separate entrance before descending to a basement office in the Owenses’ town house."
B071Y37P873,B071Y37P87,"Franny’s fingertips had turned sooty and she had a strange feeling in the pit of her stomach.

Of course it would be like Vincent to be interested in the occult, rather than something ordinary, like soccer or track and field. He was suspended from school on a regular basis for general mischief, pails of water tumbling down, cans of pepper spray going off. His ongoing behavior was a great embarrassment to their father, who had recently published a book titled A Stranger in the House, an analysis of troubled adolescents dedicated to the children, none of whom had any intention of reading it, though it was something of a bestseller.

Franny could guess where The Magus had come from. The place on their mother’s list they were never to go. Downtown. It was rumored that what was outlawed in other parts of Manhattan could be found there. Hearts of beasts, blood of men, enchantments that could prove to be lethal. The chief reason their mother did not allow them to journey to Greenwich Village was that it was viewed as a society of bohemians, drug addicts, homosexuals, and practitioners of black magic. Yet Vincent had managed to find his way there."
B078RJV3Y80,B078RJV3Y8,"It seemed Vice Salvatore may have cured me of becoming a stuttering fool with any good-looking man. All I had to do was picture him and how much he peeved me off to bring my anger forth.

Chapter

THREE

TWO WEEKS. IT took me two weeks to calm my nerves and stop thinking Mr. Salvatore would pop back into the store and fire me. I needed and loved my job … well, until my own business was 100 percent profitable. Unfortunately, I couldn’t keep the man out of my head. He even starred in some of the steamy dreams I had that involved spanking. No matter what I did, where I was, my mind conjured up the picture of him standing at the counter with his arms crossed over his broad chest, scowling.

Thankfully, it was Molly’s thirty-fifth birthday, and we were headed to meet Clinton at the restaurant he’d picked, so I hoped with a few drinks and some inspirational words from my best friend, all thoughts of Mr. Salvatore would disappear. Not that I’d told her anything yet; I knew she would get annoyed on my behalf, so I was waiting for the drinking part of the night to begin, and for us to be around Clint; he seemed to calm her temper quickly."
B078RJV3Y81,B078RJV3Y8,"John had always been good in the bedroom. It was why I hadn’t seen his cheating coming since he’d slept with me just two days before he said he was leaving. Yes, we fought, mainly over my weight, but if he couldn’t take me for who I was, then he wasn’t worth having in my life and bed. Something I told him after I slashed his tires and he called me a crazy bitch.

The bell over the door rang as someone opened it. I placed a wide smile on my face, only to freeze when my wet dream walked into the store.

Oh, God. He was… stunningly hot.

I was going to choke and burn.

He glanced over his shoulder and smiled when a woman entered just after him. I let out a whoosh of air that had caught in my lungs. When I knew the hot guy, like Clint, for instance, was taken, I was totally fine around them.

Although, I couldn’t help but feel the sad dip in my belly knowing the man candy in front of me was taken. Then again, he was totally out of my league. At least he was entertainment for a few moments in the boring night."
B078RJV3Y82,B078RJV3Y8,"She stayed until we sold the house, and then we moved in with her about six months ago. It was easier since I’d already been working in the adult store over her side of town the six months before moving in. I’d always wanted to eventually live in Mom’s area, only it took me a while to convince John to let me change schools for Drew, to save the commuting back and forth. He only recently started at his new school, and so far, so good. Although at first Drew hated the idea of being away from his friends, once we visited the new school, he fell in love with it all. What helped was the school having a basketball team. My son had been bursting at the seams to play basketball since he was six. His previous school only provided football, hockey, and soccer teams.

Stopping in the doorway to my son’s room, I found him lying on his side with Puss-it curled into his stomach enjoying the attention Drew was lathering him with as he patted the cat ’s back.

My nine-year-old looked up, and a smile bloomed. His tired eyes crinkled in the corners at the sight of me. I loved seeing it—his face softening for his mom."
B078RJV3Y83,B078RJV3Y8,"With the saving I was doing and the settlement I got from the divorce, I would be looking for a nice place in an amazing area, close to Mom. It would be for just Drew and me. And my ex-husband could go suck an egg.

When John had walked out on us two years ago for his personal trainer, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I went through all the stages, and I was sure I was still stuck on anger. It was a douche move to leave the woman he married because she’d put on weight. Apparently, I wasn’t taking care of myself, and his trainer, Dorothy, was. Didn’t matter how I was doing all cooking, cleaning, keeping his books for his graphic design company and even working part-time myself as an assistant in a dental clinic. Didn’t matter I was tired all the time and had no help at home.

What was worse, he deserted his son, only managing a phone call here and there while he was away on an extended work/vacation in Hawaii with his new woman. The thankful part about that was how Drew hadn’t had the chance for John to shove Dorothy in his face.

Me: You won’t get anymore either after the pain I went through. Childbirth wasn’t a play in the park."
B01M3SG5WR0,B01M3SG5WR,"Alec milled around the kitchen, occasionally stopping to turn one way or another, as if envisioning people working there, checking on the functionality of the space. With each step, his posture relaxed. The lines between his brows faded, and he let out a satisfied sigh, like that of a man who’d come home after a long journey.

His transformation unlocked a piece of her guarded heart. She almost said something, but then he wandered into the walk-in refrigerator and the moment was lost.

Maybe her qualms about working with a living, breathing reminder of the past had overshadowed the merits of her brother’s decision. Reconnecting with Alec might not only be the best thing for the restaurant, it might also help restore a friendship. Given the way she’d retreated from the world in recent years, she could use a friend.

Alec stepped out of the refrigerator, smiling. Not the old smile she remembered—that slightly shy but sincere one. This smile, more of a grin, really, at least was genuine. The first genuinely happy expression she’d seen him wear in two years.

Of course, that thought reminded her of the date. Of the death. Of that damn elephant she didn’t know how to tame."
B01M3SG5WR1,B01M3SG5WR,"She started the car and let the automatic wipers clear them away before heading out of the cemetery, toward her new venture, A CertainTea.

Toward the future.

Even the rain couldn’t mar the sight of the newly renovated restaurant. The elegant, one-story glass-and-stone structure sat at the end of a private driveway, amid a wooded, two-acre parcel bordered on one side by Lake Sandy. A lush, manicured lawn sloped toward the hexagonal cedar gazebo at the water’s edge, where visitors could enjoy a panorama of the four-hundred-acre lake and its shoreline, which was dotted by private homes, docks, and boats.

Colby could hardly wait to be surrounded by families celebrating engagements, birthdays, and anniversaries here. Celebrating life!

Convinced that hosting other people’s happiest moments in this peaceful setting would draw her from her perpetual state of limbo, she’d persuaded her father to invest some of Cabot Tea Company’s funds in this endeavor. Of course, that purse had strings. Technically, CTC owned A CertainTea. She’d manage it, but she’d report to her brother, Hunter.

She accepted that condition because CTC had assumed all the risk. It wasn’t like her former legal career had prepared her to be a restaurateur. But if she could run multimillion-dollar real estate and banking deals, she could manage this place."
B01M3SG5WR2,B01M3SG5WR,"She’d been running on autopilot just to get through those days, reluctant to do or say anything to make the situation at home even worse. It wasn’t until Mark had mumbled incoherent apologies and hurtled toward the balcony that she’d awakened from that haze.

By then it had been too late.

Mark had jumped to his death, much like Joe had in the fatal dare.

She closed her eyes now to block the image of Mark’s broken body on the sidewalk below. Defiantly, the gruesome vision of bone, blood, and gray matter surfaced. She forced her eyelids open, fixing her gaze on the rustling leaves as if they could erase the memory engraved on her brain. The tightness in her chest eased slightly, although her eyes still stung.

Two deep breaths later, she offered up a prayer. If she had one fervent wish since her husband’s death, it was that he finally found the peace that had eluded him in life. Assuming things went according to plan, she might also know peace soon.

She twisted the platinum wedding band she still wore out of respect—and guilt—while staring blankly at the light rain now dotting the windshield. Like tears, she thought."
B01M3SG5WR3,B01M3SG5WR,"Opposing images of Alec cycled through her mind like a flip book: him patiently tutoring her in French (which she’d only taken because, when she’d heard him speak it, it had sounded more romantic than Spanish), then politely brushing her off at the grocery store a few months after the funerals. Knowing her face would always be a painful reminder of Joe’s death, she’d given Alec the space he’d demanded without words.

He must be desperate to be willing to work with her now.

She shut off the engine but remained inside the car with the window cracked open. Leafy branches swayed in the breeze, sounding like the ghostly whispers Mark had often spoken of during manic phases. In those moments, he’d declared himself a prophet, which had frightened her, although no more than many other things he’d done or said during their marriage.

If she hadn’t become benumbed to his brain’s pattern of recovery from mania, she might’ve noticed that his depression following Joe’s death had been more acute. Might’ve realized that taking a little time off from work to comfort him wouldn’t be enough. Might not have missed the fact that he’d been lying about taking his meds and seeing his doctor.

But Mark had been a pretty good liar, and maybe she’d been too caught up in her own disillusionment and grief about Joe to notice."
B001C4NXKM0,B001C4NXKM,"She flashed the cigarette a disapproving look but said nothing. That restored some of his confidence—some, but not much. She had always been good at biding her time.

She dropped the iron spider skillet into the gray dishwater and it hissed a little. She hadn’t changed much, Larry was thinking. A little older— she would be fifty-one now—a little grayer, but there was still plenty of black left in that sensibly netted head of hair. She was wearing a plain gray dress, probably the one she worked in. Her bosom was still the same large comber blooming out of the bodice of the dress—a little larger, if anything. Mom, tell me the truth, has your bosom gotten bigger? Is that the fundamental change?

He started to tap cigarette ashes into his coffee saucer; she jerked it away and replaced it with the ashtray she always kept in the cupboard. The saucer had been sloppy with coffee and it had seemed okay to tap in it. The ashtray was clean, reproachfully spotless, and he tapped into it with a slight pang. She could bide her time and she could keep springing small traps on you until your ankles were all bloody and you were ready to start gibbering."
B001C4NXKM1,B001C4NXKM,"Both legs had gone to sleep; pins and needles tingled up from the balls of his feet as he opened the door and got out. He had never expected to meet her this way, unprepared and exposed. He felt like a sentry who had fallen asleep at his post suddenly called to attention. He had somehow expected his mother to look smaller, less sure of herself, a trick of the years that had matured him and left her just the same.

But it was almost uncanny, the way she had caught him. When he was ten, she used to wake him up on Saturday mornings after she thought he had slept long enough by tapping one finger on his closed bedroom door. She had wakened him this same way fourteen years later, sleeping in his new car like a tired kid who had tried to stay up all night and got caught by the sandman in an undignified position.

Now he stood before her, his hair corkscrewed, a faint and rather foolish grin on his face. Pins and needles still coursed up his legs, making him shift from foot to foot. He remembered that she always asked him if he had to go to the bathroom when he did that and now he stopped the movement and let the needles prick him at will."
B001C4NXKM2,B001C4NXKM,"It had only been nine in the morning but the stereo was on, both TVs, and it sounded like an orgy was going on in the basement playroom. Larry had been sitting in an overstuffed living room chair, wearing only underpants, and trying owlishly to get the sense from a Superboy comic book. He felt very alert, but none of the words seemed to connect to anything. There was no gestalt. A Wagner piece was thundering from the quad speakers, and Wayne had to shout three or four times to make himself understood. Then Larry nodded. He felt as if he could walk for miles.

But when the sunlight struck Larry’s eyeballs like needles, he suddenly changed his mind. No walk. Uh-uh. His eyes had been turned into magnifying glasses, and soon the sun would shine through them long enough to set his brains on fire. His poor old brains felt tinder-dry.

Wayne, gripping his arm firmly, insisted. They went down to the beach, over the warming sand to the darker brown hardpack, and Larry decided it had been a pretty good idea after all. The deepening sound of the breakers coming home was soothing. A gull, working to gain altitude, hung straining in the blue sky like a sketched white letter M.

Wayne tugged his arm firmly."
B001C4NXKM3,B001C4NXKM,"His mind began to drift away again, mulling over the last nine weeks or so, trying to find some sort of key that would make everything clear and explain how you could butt yourself against stone walls for six long years, playing the clubs, making demo tapes, doing sessions, the whole bit, and then suddenly make it in nine weeks. Trying to get that straight in your mind was like trying to swallow a doorknob. There had to be an answer, he thought, an explanation that would allow him to reject the ugly notion that the whole thing had been a whim, a simple twist of fate, in Dylan’s words.

He dozed deeper, arms crossed on his chest, going over it and over it, and mixed up in all of it was this new thing, like a low and sinister counterpoint, one note at the threshold of audibility played on a synthesizer, heard in a migrainy sort of way that acted on you like a premonition: the rat, digging into the dead cat’s body, munch, munch, just looking for something tasty here. It’s the law of the jungle, my man, if you’re in the trees you got to swing …

It had really started eighteen months ago. He had been playing with the Tattered Remnants in a Berkeley club, and a man from Columbia had called. Not a biggie, just another toiler in the vinyl vineyards."
B0192CTMW80,B0192CTMW8,"But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.

What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He’d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. . . .

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes —

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn."
B0192CTMW81,B0192CTMW8,"At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why — Voldemort’s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous . . . but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.

The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a real present, let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely . . ."
B0192CTMW82,B0192CTMW8,"What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the Wizarding world.

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before."
B0192CTMW83,B0192CTMW8,"Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.

Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.

He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the Wizarding world (six tall goalposts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).

All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home."
B0138OAB800,B0138OAB80,"He pounded the steering wheel and laughed even louder: jubilant, bemused, incredulous. If he had been driving in New Town, Limbe, he would have gotten out of the car and hugged someone on the street, telling them, Bo, you won’t even believe the news I just got. In New Town, he would have known at least one person on the street with whom to share his good news, but here, on these streets of old brick houses and faded lawns in the Bronx, he knew no one he could run to and repeat what Clark’s secretary had just told him. There was a young black man walking with headphones on, banging his head to some kind of good music; three teenage Asian girls covering their mouths and giggling, none of them with a school bag; a woman rushing somewhere, pushing a fat baby in a pink umbrella stroller. There was an African man, too, but judging from his dark angular face and flowing grand boubou, he had to be Senegalese or Burkinabé or from one of the other French-speaking West African countries. Jende could not run out to him just because they were both West Africans — he needed to rejoice with someone who knew his name and his story."
B0138OAB801,B0138OAB80,"And for the very first time in her life, she had a dream besides marriage and motherhood: to become a pharmacist like the ones everyone respected in Limbe because they handed out health and happiness in pill bottles. To achieve this dream, she had to do well in school, and she was doing just that—maintaining a B-plus average. Three days a week she went to school and, after classes, walked the school’s hallways with her bulky algebra, chemistry, biology, and philosophy textbooks, glowing because she was growing into a learned woman. As often as she could, she sat in the library to do her homework, or went to office hours to hound professors for advice on what she needed to do to get better grades so she could get into a great pharmacy school. She was going to make herself proud, make Jende proud of his wife, make Liomi proud of his mother. She’d waited too long to become something, and now, at thirty-three, she finally had, or was close enough to having, everything she’d ever wanted in life.

He was on White Plains Road when the call came in. Four minutes later, he closed his flip phone and laughed."
B0138OAB802,B0138OAB80,"A year and a half later now and New York City was her home, a place with all the pleasures she desired. She woke up next to the man she loved and turned her face to see their child. For the first time in her life, she had a job, as a home health aide through an agency that paid her in cash, since she had no working papers. She was a matriculated student for the first time in sixteen years, studying chemistry at Borough of Manhattan Community College, never worrying about her tuition because she knew Jende would always pay the three-thousand-dollars-a-semester fee without grumbling, unlike her father, who unceasingly complained about his financial headaches and delivered a lecture about CFA francs not growing on mango trees whenever one of his eight children asked for money for school fees or new uniforms. For the first time in much too long, she didn’t wake up in the morning with no plans except to clean the house, go to the market, cook for her parents and siblings, take care of Liomi, meet with her friends and listen to them bash their mothers-in-law, go to bed and look forward to more of the same the next day because her life was going neither forward nor backward."
B0138OAB803,B0138OAB80,"And she still clearly remembered lying in bed next to Jende after they were done, listening to the sounds of America outside the window, the chatter and laughter of African-American men and women on the streets of Harlem, and telling herself: I am in America, I am truly in America.

She could never forget that day.

Or the day, two weeks after their arrival, when they were married at city hall with Liomi as their ring bearer and Jende’s cousin Winston as their witness. On that day in May 2006, she finally became a respectable woman, a woman declared worthy of love and protection.

Limbe was now some faraway town, a place she had loved less with every new day Jende was not there. Without him to go for a walk on the beach with, go dancing with, or sit with at a drinking spot and enjoy a cold Malta Guinness on a hot Sunday afternoon, the town was no longer her beloved hometown but a desolate place she couldn’t wait to get out of. In every phone call during the time they were apart she had reminded him of this, of her inability to stop daydreaming about the day she would leave Limbe and be with him in America."
B00ZP4KE700,B00ZP4KE70,"Every day he asked if she was recovered enough to walk with him in the gardens. When she couldn’t, he sent slaves to fetch flowers for her bedside. In May, it was yellow jonquil, purple hyacinth, orange lilies, and then red hollyhock. But by early autumn the perfume of crimson dwarf roses couldn’t disguise the fetid scent of sickness in the room.

Since the birth of the baby Mama had borne after we’d returned from the wilderness, Mama had lingered in bed saying she’d never rise up again. Like Papa, I refused to believe her, but

in this moment, she reached for my hand to convince me. My hand had always felt tiny in her palm, but now her hand seemed smaller, fragile.

I turned my head, so she wouldn’t see my fear, and glimpsed the small room that opened at the head of her bed where my father spoke with Dr. Gilmer, who treated Mama and asked no more than to borrow some salt and sugar for his pains. Through all the months of my mother’s illness, Papa was never farther from her than this.

The men’s conversation was hushed and somber until some question forced my father to answer with bitter indignation."
B00ZP4KE701,B00ZP4KE70,"My father’s gaze darted to the men in our fields with sharp instruments in their hands, and a strange and sickly feeling stole over me. Is my papa afraid of them? Afraid of his own slaves? It was the first time I ever wondered such a thing.

Papa’s wrist was bent at an ungainly angle. The overseer rode out to fetch a trustworthy doctor while Mama fretted that there might not be one so far from Charlottesville. It was nearly night when the doctor arrived to do his grisly business of resetting Papa’s bones. After, Mama wrapped my father’s wrist and gave him the last of our brandy for the pain. Upon orders from the physician, Papa was forbidden to ride or go out from our cabin for two weeks. Unless, of course, the British chased us from here.

I remember that in those weeks, Mama and Papa were tender with one another every moment of every day. Our meals were simple. Our days were long. I was forever keeping Polly from mischief. At night, in spite of his painful injury, Papa led us in cheerful song while Polly and I bundled together atop a little nest of quilts.

Kissing us good night, my father gave a sly smile."
B00ZP4KE702,B00ZP4KE70,"That’s when I first knew my mother had heard enough of revolution and the sacrifice of patriots. Indeed, it seemed to be her singular mission to draw Papa into the delights of simple domestic life. Though the overseer’s cabin was no proper home for a gentleman’s family, Mama set up housekeeping. She had me down on my knees with her, scrubbing at the floorboards with a stiff brush. We hung quilts and beat dust out of them. And when

Papa had to leave to make his forays into the woods, Mama and I saw to it that there was a candle burning in the one window of the cottage to guide him back to us.

A few weeks later, harvest time for the wheat arrived, and Mama sent me with Papa to oversee the slaves toiling in our fields with sharp sickles. The women cut the stalks, beads of sweat running down their bare brown arms. Meanwhile, the shirtless dark-skinned men gathered the cut wheat into bundles, hauling the golden sheaves into the sun to dry.

I loved nothing more than riding atop majestic Caractacus with Papa, and though we were far away from our mountaintop home, it almost made me feel everything was just the way it should be.

But I knew it wasn’t."
B00ZP4KE703,B00ZP4KE70,"Together, we settled her into a rocking chair, where she struggled to recover herself. Given how recently Mama had lost her baby, she was apt to be sad and fragile. And the next day, she was still in that chair, needlework forgotten in her lap, when a rider approached the house.

At the sound of the horse hooves, Mr. Rose readied his musket and Mr. Short crouched by the window, pistol in hand. I froze, clutching a broom, wondering if I could wield it against a Redcoat if one should come through the door.

But then we heard Papa call to us.

Dropping my broom, I ran out to meet him. Though he’d been gone only a week, he looked thin and mangy. His skin was sunburnt and he’d traded his gentleman’s clothing for the garb of a frontiersman. Clad in brown leather breeches, a hunting shirt open at the neck, and a black hat that shadowed his eyes, he dismounted Caractacus and grabbed me into his arms, carrying me all the way inside. I clung to him, burying my face in his neck as he entered the house.

From the rocking chair, Mama attempted a smile, but her lower lip wobbled."
B06Y55SB480,B06Y55SB48,"It could fit ten thousand cubic meters of cargo through in a single cycle, but bringing it in was a slow process. The pod had arrived hours earlier. EVA masters had brought the entire pod into the airlock and gave it the high-pressure air cleanse.

We do everything we can to keep lunar dust from entering the city. Hell, I hadn’t even skipped the cleanse after my faulty valve adventure earlier that day. Why go through all that hassle? Because lunar dust is extremely bad to breathe. It’s made of teeny, tiny rocks, and there’s been no weather to smooth them out. Each mote is a spiky, barbed nightmare just waiting to tear up your lungs. You’re better off smoking a pack of asbestos cigarettes than breathing that shit.

By the time I got to the freight airlock, the giant inner door stood open and the pod was being unloaded. I slid up to Nakoshi, the head longshoreman. He sat at his inspection table and examined the contents of a shipping box. Satisfied that it contained no contraband, he closed the box and stamped it with the Artemis symbol—a capital A with the right side styled to look like a bow and arrow."
B06Y55SB481,B06Y55SB48,"The room buzzed with activity. I slid my way between workers who efficiently glided to and fro. In town, you have to walk slowly or you’ll knock over tourists. But the port is for professionals only. We all know the Artemis Longstep and can get a good head of steam going.

At the north side of the port, a few commuters waited near the train airlock. Most were headed to the city reactors and Sanchez Aluminum’s smelter, a kilometer south of town. The smelter uses insane amounts of heat and extremely nasty chemicals, so everyone agrees it should be far away. As for the reactors…well…they’re nuclear reactors. We like those far away too.

Dale slithered over to the train platform. He’d be going to the Apollo 11 Visitor Center. Tourists love it. The half-hour train ride provides stunning views of the moon’s terrain, and the Visitor Center is a great place to look at the landing site without ever leaving pressure. And for those who do want to venture outside to get a better view, Dale and other EVA masters are ready to give them a tour.

Just in front of the train airlock there was a huge Kenyan flag."
B06Y55SB482,B06Y55SB48,"If you have to ask, you can’t afford it. The Ritz-Carlton Artemis occupies an entire block and extends five floors up and another five down. A single night there costs 12,000 slugs —more than I make in a month as a porter (though I have other sources of income).

Despite the costs of a lunar vacation, demand always exceeds supply. Middle-class Earthers can afford it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience with suitable financing. They stay at crappier hotels in crappier bubbles like Conrad. But wealthy folks make annual trips and stay in nice hotels. And my, oh my, do they shop.

More than anywhere else, Aldrin is where money enters Artemis.

There was nothing in the shopping district I could afford. But someday, I’d have enough to belong there. That was my plan, anyway. I took one more long look, then turned away and headed to the Port of Entry.

Aldrin is the closest bubble to the landing zone. Wouldn’t want rich people dirtying themselves by traveling through impoverished areas, right? Bring them straight into the pretty part.

I strolled through the large archway into the port. The massive airlock complex is the second-largest chamber in the city. (Only Aldrin Park is larger.)"
B06Y55SB483,B06Y55SB48,"None of the elevators were nearby, so I bounded up the stairs three at a time. Stairwells in the core are just like stairwells on Earth—short little twenty-one-centimeter-high steps. It makes the tourists more comfortable. In areas that don’t get tourists, stairs are each a half meter high. That’s lunar gravity for you. Anyway, I hopped up the tourist stairs until I reached ground level. Walking up fifteen floors of stairwell probably sounds horrible, but it’s not that big a deal here. I wasn’t even winded.

Ground level is where all the tunnels connecting to other bubbles come in. Naturally, all the shops, boutiques, and other tourist traps want to be there to take advantage of the foot traffic. In Conrad, that mostly meant restaurants selling Gunk to tourists who can’t afford real food.

A small crowd funneled into the Aldrin Connector. It’s the only way to get from Conrad to Aldrin (other than going the long way around through Armstrong), so it’s a major thoroughfare. I passed by the huge circular plug door on my way in. If the tunnel breached, the escaping air from Conrad would force that door closed. Everyone in Conrad would be saved. If you were in the tunnel at the time … well, it sucks to be you."
B018ER7K5I0,B018ER7K5I,"Mounted inside the door of the cupboard over the double-basin sink was a large varnished board in the shape of a key—one of Stan’s clients had made it in his workshop and given it to him two Christmases ago. The key-board was studded with small hooks, and swinging on these were all the keys the house took, two duplicates of each to a hook. Beneath each hook was a strip of Mystik tape, each strip lettered in Stan’s small, neat printing: GARAGE, ATTIC, D’STAIRS BATH, UPSTAIRS BATH, FRONT DOOR, BACK DOOR. Off to one side were ignition-key dupes labelled M-B and VOLVO.

Patty snatched the key marked UPSTAIRS BATH, began to run for the stairs, and then made herself walk. Running made the panic want to come back, and the panic was too close to the surface as it was. Also, if she just walked, maybe nothing would be wrong. Or, if there was something wrong, God could look down, see she was just walking, and think: Oh, good— I pulled a hell of a boner, but I’ve got time to take it all back.

Walking as sedately as a woman on her way to a Ladies’ Book Circle meeting, she went up the stairs and down to the closed bathroom door."
B018ER7K5I1,B018ER7K5I,"She stood there, perfectly still, a pale statue with a pulse beating in its throat.

Now she could remember running back down here, feet stuttering on the stair-levels, running for the phone, oh yes, oh sure, but who had she meant to call?

Crazily, she thought: I would call the turtle, but the turtle couldn’t help us.

It didn’t matter anyway. She had gotten as far as 0 and she must have said something not quite standard, because the operator had asked if she had a problem. She had one, all right, but how did you tell that faceless voice that Stanley had locked himself in the bathroom and didn’t answer her, that the steady sound of the water dripping into the tub was killing her heart? Someone had to help her. Someone—

She put the back of her hand into her mouth and deliberately bit down on it. She tried to think, tried to force herself to think.

The spare keys. The spare keys in the kitchen cupboard.

She got going, and one slippered foot kicked the bag of buttons resting beside her chair. Some of the buttons spilled out, glittering like glazed eyes in the lamplight. She saw at least half a dozen black ones."
B018ER7K5I2,B018ER7K5I,"Patty slammed it down in its cradle and stepped away, rubbing the hand which had held it. She looked around and saw she was back in the TV room and understood that the panic which had come into the front of her mind like a prowler walking quietly up a flight of stairs had had its way with her. Now she could remember dropping the beer can outside the bathroom door and pelting headlong back down the stairs, thinking vaguely: This is all a mistake of some kind and we’ll laugh about it later. He filled up the tub and then remembered he didn’t have cigarettes and went out to get them before he took his clothes off—

Yes. Only he had already locked the bathroom door from the inside and because it was too much of a bother to unlock it again he had simply opened the window over the tub and gone down the side of the house like a fly crawling down a wall. Sure, of course, sure—

Panic was rising in her mind again— it was like bitter black coffee threatening to overflow the rim of a cup. She closed her eyes and fought against it."
B018ER7K5I3,B018ER7K5I,"And she was suddenly, terribly sure that it had been Stanley, not her father, who had been stricken with a heart attack tonight.

With a moan, she gripped the cut-glass doorknob and turned it. Yet still the door would not move: it was locked. And suddenly three nevers occurred to Patty Uris in rapid succession: Stanley never took a bath in the early evening, Stanley never closed the door unless he was using the toilet, and Stanley had never locked the door against her at all.

Was it possible , she wondered crazily, to prepare for a heart attack?

Patty ran her tongue over her lips— it produced a sound in her head like fine sandpaper sliding along a board—and called his name again. There was still no answer except the steady, deliberate drip of the faucet. She looked down and saw she still held the can of Dixie beer in one hand. She gazed at it stupidly, her heart running like a rabbit in her throat; she gazed at it as if she had never seen a can of beer in her whole life before this minute. And indeed it seemed she never had, or at least never one like this, because when she blinked her eyes it turned into a telephone handset, as black and as threatening as a snake."

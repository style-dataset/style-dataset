B06XH4WFB10,B06XH4WFB1,"Cassie and I had pictured our veterinary selves in professional white coats and smart, clicky low-heeled pumps, and while Marj wasn’t a vet (when a vet was needed, Dr. Murphy came in from Haverhill, bluff and bearded, his belly tight beneath his white coat), she gave us a different sense of how you could be in the world: someone who did what you did for the love of it, and didn’t care what anybody thought.

Marj really loved those animals. Her leather hands were all pop-up veins, but when she touched the tottering, one-eyed pug Stinky on his rippled tummy, she was tender, and when she held a skittish cat like Loulou to her loose bosom, the cat’s wild eyes would quickly grow heavy, her body slack, and she’d emit the low, motorized hum of feline pleasure. Marj was especially good with the pit bulls and pit crosses that the shelter got in such numbers. Most people were afraid of them, even just a little, and Cassie and I were considered too young to take on their care; but Marj approached each one as if he were a long-lost friend, murmuring in a low voice, careful but sure. They called her the Pit Whisperer, but it didn’t always work out well. She had the scars to prove it."
B06XH4WFB11,B06XH4WFB1,"We flipped repeatedly through Tiger Beat—my mom had got me a subscription because of my interest in music, and because she’d had one when she was young. I was interested in what the bands sounded like; Cassie rated them on how they looked. Her mother had explained that there were people out in Hollywood or in New York who made a living choosing the outfits for celebrities to wear. Bev didn’t say this like it was a good thing; more like, We live in such a crazy world that some people think this is an acceptable way to spend your life! But that’s not how Cassie took it. She loved fashion. We’d dawdle in the makeup aisle at Rite Aid while she tested every different eye shadow on the back of her hand. I pretended to be into it because she loved it so much. She thought Lady Gaga was cool not for her songs but for her fashion sense: those crazy shoes; that dress made out of meat. And partly, maybe, because you couldn’t get further from Bev Burnes than Lady Gaga.

Bev approved of our desire to become vets. She encouraged it. She was the one who approached my mother and suggested that if they split the driving, it wouldn’t be a hassle for us to work at the shelter."
B015CXRP9S0,B015CXRP9S,"The first duty of a Queen’s Guard was to protect the ruler from harm, and even if the Queen wasn’t dead, she was still at the mercy of the Mort. Even Maman could not say what was happening to her in their camp.

On the other side of the Mace sat Pen, his face pale and drawn. Whatever agonies Aisa and the other guards endured over the Queen’s welfare, no one was suffering like Pen, who had been the Queen’s close guard . . . and more, Aisa thought. He was little use these days, for he seemed able to do nothing but mope and drink, and when someone called his name he would only look up in a slightly confused manner. Some part of Pen had been lost on the day the Queen broke the bridge, and although he sat next to the Mace, in the place of a close guard, his gaze remained fixed on the table, lost. Coryn, who sat beside him, was his usual alert self, so Aisa didn’t worry, but she wondered how much more slack Elston was going to extend to Pen. What would it take for someone to voice the truth: that Pen was no longer fit for the job?"
B015CXRP9S1,B015CXRP9S,"Both men were still dressed in full armor, for they had just come in from the front. For the past week, the last remnants of the Tear army had trailed the vast Mort war train as it crossed the Caddell and began a slow but steady progress eastward, across the Almont. As impossible as it seemed, the Mort were withdrawing, packing up their siege equipment and heading home.

But why?

No one knew. The Tear army had been decimated, and New London’s defenses were paper-thin; Elston said that the Mort could have torn right through them. The army was keeping a close eye on the invaders, in case of a trick, but by now even the Mace seemed convinced that the withdrawal was real. The Mort were leaving. There was no sense in it, but it was happening, all the same. General Hall said that the Mort soldiers weren’t even looting on their way home.

All of this was good news, but the mood at this table was anything but ebullient. There had still been no word on the Queen. Her body had not been left behind when the Mort moved out. Maman said she was a prisoner, and the thought made Aisa’s blood boil."
B00H22Z6260,B00H22Z626,"**

Oh my, that drive was so exciting. Don’t forget, we’d been stuck in The Castle for most of our lives, never been in a coach, never even been out of the East End. Our eyes was on stalks all the way, like we had never seen the wonderful things passing by, watching the people doing their shopping, hanging out their washing, children playing. In one place, we passed a factory at clocking-off time and got stuck in a swarm of men on bicycles—like giant insects, they looked to us—and so many we quickly lost count. They saw us gawping through the coach windows and waved, which made them wobble all over the place, and it was an odd feeling to be noticed, not being invisible for once.

It was just as well we had plenty to distract us, ’cause by the time we’d said our good-byes at The Castle, both of us were blubbing. Strange, isn’t it, you can spend so many years wishing yourself out of somewhere, and once you get out, all you want to do is go back? Not that I ever felt that about this place. It’s a funny old feeling, coming here today, I can tell you."
B00H22Z6261,B00H22Z626,"She goes on to tell us that the grand lady who came a few months ago is a duchess and is the patron of the Needlework Society and was visiting to inspect the work that the convent was doing for the poor children of the city. She was so impressed by the needlework Nora and me showed her that she is sending her housekeeper to interview us about going into service.

A duchess! Well, you can imagine how excited we was but scared too, as we haven’t a clue what to expect, and our imaginations go into overtime. We was going to live in a beautiful mansion with a huge garden and sew clothes for very important people, and Nora is going to fall in love with one of the chauffeurs but I have my sights set a bit higher, a soldier in the Light Brigade in his red uniform perhaps, or a city gent in a bowler hat. Either way, both of us are going to have our own comfortable houses next door to each other with little gardens where we can grow flowers and good things to eat and have lots of children who will play together, and we will live happily ever after.

There’s a pause. She clears her throat loudly.

Forgive me, miss, don’t mind if I has a smoke?"
B01GGN0GEO0,B01GGN0GEO,"I’ve lingered in the cafeteria. Wandered the corridors. Been into the TV lounge with its endless rolling news. I thought I might have caught a glimpse of myself on television, but after an hour of depressing world calamities, I gave up and left the room. I’d like to wear some proper clothes. These donated pyjamas are making me think I’m ill, when I’m not. I’m sure I won’t be able to stay here much longer anyway. I’m taking up a bed when I don’t really need it. But where can I go? I have no home that I know of.

As I laze in bed, I watch the nurses moving around the ward, kind and efficient. Dr Lazowski says the danger has passed. That I’m no longer dehydrated or in danger of an infection in my lungs. Apparently, I’m now perfectly healthy. She says I should be fine. Fine? How can I be fine when I still don’t even know who I am? I should have the results back from my MRI within a few days. Perhaps that will shed some light on what’s happening in my brain.

The police haven’t been back for a visit, so maybe their lead was a dead-end."
B01GGN0GEO1,B01GGN0GEO,"They’re just going to take some pictures and then it will all be over.

They warned me about the banging noise the machine would make, but even with the earplugs, it still makes me jump. It’s a good thing my head is held in place. I concentrate on my breathing. I close my eyes and tell myself to let go of the panic. To think of something calming. This machine is here to help me. These people are here to help me. I breathe in, and out, slowing my heartbeats and easing my fear. The mind is an incredible thing – it can steer you to madness, or furnish you with comfort. I relax my brain and try to conjure up a restful image. I see water, but instead of feeling scared by it, I am soothed. I see dappled light playing across inky blue ripples. I hear a steady splash, splash, splash. Feel warm sunlight on my face. Is this a daydream? Or a memory?

The rest of the scan passes without incident, and before I know it, it’s over.

I’m sitting on my bed, flicking through old magazines. I’m restless. Bored. I’ve been outside into the courtyard gardens."
B07B8FCP7F0,B07B8FCP7F,"Before me were hundreds of bicycle frames, locked together with vines of rust, their tires gone, their backs broken.

They say that somewhere in Africa the elephants have a secret grave where they go to lie down, unburden their wrinkled gray bodies, and soar away, light spirits at the end. I believed at that moment in time that I had found the grave of the bicycles, where the carcasses flake away year after year under rain and baking sun, long after the spirits of their wandering lives have gone. In some places on that huge pile the bicycles had melted away until they resembled nothing more than red and copper leaves waiting to be burned on an autumn afternoon. In some places shattered headlights poked up, sightless but defiant, in a dead way. Warped handlebars still held rubber grips, and from some of the grips dangled strips of colored vinyl like faded flames. I had a vision of all these bikes, vibrant in their new paint, with new tires and new pedals and chains that snuggled up to their sprockets in beds of clean new grease. It made me sad, in a way I couldn’t understand, because I saw how there is an end to all things, no matter how much we want to hold on to them."
B07B8FCP7F1,B07B8FCP7F,"My dad had hurried out to help, and he’d come home a couple of hours later with ashes in his hair and his clothes smelling of burnt timber. After that night, and what he’d seen, he hadn’t wanted to be a fireman anymore.

We were on Route Sixteen right now. And the car that had wrecked and burned was Midnight Mona, with Little Stevie Cauley behind the wheel.

Little Stevie Cauley’s body — what was left of it , I mean — lay in a coffin in the cemetery on Poulter Hill. Midnight Mona was gone, too, to wherever burned-up cars go.

But I had seen it, racing up behind us out of the mist. I had seen someone sitting behind the wheel.

I kept my mouth shut. I was in enough trouble already.

Dad turned off Route Sixteen and eased the truck onto a muddy side road that wound through the woods. We reached a place where rusted old metal signs of all descriptions had been nailed to the trees; there were at least a hundred of them, advertisements for everything from Green Spot Orange Soda to B.C. Headache Powders to the Grand Ole Opry. Beyond the signpost forest the road led to a house of gray wood with a sagging front porch and in the front yard —"
B00HDMMC7M0,B00HDMMC7M,"She lifted the lid and sniffed. Then, guiltily, she reached into the cupboard and added a pinch of salt, some cumin and cornflour, stirred, then replaced the lid.

She went to the little liver-spotted mirror by the medicine cupboard and tried to smooth her hair, which had already begun to frizz in the moisture-filled air. She could barely see all of her face at once; the Donleavy family could never be accused of vanity, that was for sure.

She rubbed again at her lips, then turned back to the kitchen, her solitude allowing her to see it with a dispassionate eye. She surveyed the linoleum, cracked and ingrained with years of agricultural dirt that wouldn’t lift, no matter how many times it was mopped and swept. Her sister had planned to replace it, had even shown Letty the design she fancied, in a book sent all the way from Perth. She took in the faded paintwork, the calendar that marked only this or that agricultural show, the arrival of vets, buyers or grain salesmen, the dogs’ baskets with their filthy old blankets lined up round the range, and the packet of Bluo for the men’s shirts, spilling its grains on to the bleached work surface."
B00HDMMC7M1,B00HDMMC7M,"She studied them, frowning at their familiarity, at the peeling pale gray paintwork, a soft color you saw nowhere but on British naval ships. After a minute, she lowered the umbrella, stepped back, and stared up at the broken hull looming above her, stiff neck temporarily forgotten.

She lifted her hand to shield her eyes from the fierce sun until she could see what remained of the name on the side.

And then, as the last of the letters became distinct, the arguing voices receded, and even in the oppressive heat of an Indian afternoon, the old woman beneath the ship felt herself possessed of a sudden and icy cold.

_ ____

The shipbreaker, Mr. Bhattacharya, was unconvinced, yet even in the face of his mounting hostility, the growing restlessness of the crowd and even that they were now a good hour behind schedule, the young people were still bickering. Mr. Vaghela wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. Miss Jennifer was kicking sand angrily behind her, her expression one of sulky acquiescence. Mr. Sanjay wore the uncomfortably flushed countenance of someone who feels himself to be defending an unwinnable argument. Periodically he would look at Miss Jennifer, then away, as if he, too, were annoyed with her."
B00D5YWZFQ0,B00D5YWZFQ,"And he didn’t like that she was.

He had to get her shot of this guy.

What he could see was what Chace said. Whatever made her make the change, grow her hair, get her style together, take off weight, could mean she was finally moving beyond what happened to her and looking to enter the game, find a man. And maybe after not having one for as long as he’d known her, before (if what Elsbeth said was true) and likely for a while after, it could make her think she struck gold with a tall, good-looking, built guy who showed her a fuckload of attention. This might make her put up with a load of shit that might send up red flags she’d ignore just to get that attention, the kind she’d never had.

His eyes drifted to his mantel and the long, polished, handsomely carved wooden box sitting there.

Seeing that box, he again couldn’t see Emme doing that.

Further, McFarland had tried that possessive bullshit with her in front of Deck and she ended it in a second.

He was whipped. She was not the one having the wool pulled. He had her and he was still gagging for more."
B00D5YWZFQ1,B00D5YWZFQ,"The new, beautiful, stylish Emme with McFarland.

He couldn’t get used to seeing her like that, even as long as he studied those photos. If the dimple wasn’t there, he wouldn’t believe it was her. And if there weren’t shots of her without sunglasses so he could see her eyes. Eyes he always thought of as exotic. Perfect almonds coming to points at the sides that tipped up, back then her most attractive feature (outside the dimple) by far. Now it was debatable.

Jeff was right. She and McFarland spent a lot of time together. And McFarland wanted it known she was his. He did this by touching her all the fucking time. Hand to her hip, her waist, the small of her back. Arm around her shoulders. Her in both his arms, his mouth locked to hers. PDA and lots of it.

If Deck didn’t know her and he had that dimple in his bed, those light brown eyes he could make dance, he’d likely do the same.

But he didn’t like it with McFarland. It wasn’t just possessive. It wasn’t at all protective. It was a statement and it was borderline creepy.

He couldn’t see Emme putting up with that."
B000YJ67A40,B000YJ67A4,"A blind moment later, I encountered another column bristling with barnacles. I followed it to the surface.

Gasping for air that smelled of iodine and tar, that tasted of salt and chalk, I clung to the encrusted concrete, the barnacles sharp and slick under my hands, and I pulled my sweatshirt sleeves down to protect against cuts as best I could.

At the moment low on energy, the ocean rolled rhythmically and without violence between the pilings, toward shore. Although tame, it nevertheless sought to pull me away from the column.

Every minute I strove to hold fast would drain my strength. My sodden sweatshirt felt like a heavy flak jacket.

The liquid soliloquy of the sea echoed in murmurs and whispers along the pier floor, which was now my ceiling. I heard no shouts from above, no thunder of running footsteps.

Daylight as clouded and as gray as bilge water seeped into this sheltered space. Overhead, an architecture of thick vertical posts, horizontal tie beams, struts, and purlins dwindled into shadows.

The top of this piling, on which one of the posts stood, lay less than three feet above my head. I toed and kneed and clawed upward, repeatedly slipping backward but stubbornly gaining more ground than I lost."
B000YJ67A41,B000YJ67A4,"I sensed strength in her, yet she also had an aura of innocence, an almost waiflike air of vulnerability. The three men were the kind to whom vulnerability had a scent as surely as rabbits hidden in tall grass have a smell easily detected by wolves.

Bad men wound and destroy one another, although as targets they prefer those who are innocent and as pure as this world allows anyone to be. They feed on violence, but they feast on the despoiling of what is good.

As Annamaria and I walked off the observation deck and toward the shore, I was dismayed that no one had come onto the pier. Usually a few evening fishermen would already have arrived with rods and tackle boxes.

I glanced back and saw Boo moving closer to the three men, who were oblivious of him. The hulk with the chin beard looked over the heads of the other two, again staring at Annamaria and me.

The shore was still distant. The shrouded sun slowly sank behind a thousand fathoms of clouds, toward the drowning horizon, and rising mist damped the lamplight.

When I looked back again, the freckled pair were approaching at a brisk walk."
B004IATCU20,B004IATCU2,"What did Shawn Gallagher do with his great gift but sit and dream? If he had a lick of ambition, or true pride in his work, he’d sell his tunes instead of just writing them and piling them up in boxes.

The man needed a good kick in the ass for wasting something God had given him.

But that, she thought, was an annoyance for another day. She had work of her own to do.

She started to get up, to reach for her toolbox again, when a movement caught the corner of her eye. She straightened like a spike, mortified at the thought of Shawn coming back—he was always forgetting something—and catching her playing with his music.

But it wasn’t Shawn who stood in the doorway.

The woman had pale gold hair that tumbled around the shoulders of a plain gray dress that swept down to the floor. Her eyes were a soft green, her smile so sad it broke the heart at first glance.

Recognition, shock, and a giddy excitement raced through Brenna all at once. She opened her mouth, but whatever she intended to say came out in a wheeze as her pulse pounded.

She tried again, faintly embarrassed that her knees were shaking."
B004IATCU21,B004IATCU2,"Oh, she could sing out a rebel song without making the dog howl in response, but playing was a different kettle of fish altogether.

Since she was alone, she decided to satisfy her curiosity. She set her toolbox down again, chose one of the sheets, and sat down. Gnawing her lip, she found middle C on the keyboard and slowly, painstakingly, picked out the written notes, one finger at a time.

It was lovely, of course. Everything he wrote was lovely, and even her pitiful playing couldn’t kill the beauty of it completely.

He’d added words to this one, as he often did. Brenna cleared her throat and attempted to match her voice to the proper note.

When I’m alone in the night, and the moon sheds its tears, I know my world would come right if only you were here. Without you, my heart is empty of all but the memories it keeps. You, only you, stay inside me in the night while the moon weeps.

She stopped, sighed a little, as there was no one to hear. It touched her, as his songs always did, but a little deeper this time. A little truer.

Moon tears, she thought. Pearls for Lady Gwen. A love that asked, but couldn’t be answered."
B000SEGUDE0,B000SEGUDE,"He slid back inside the coils of rope, leaving me to the near-impossible task of constructing a case for an Aboriginal stowaway, aboard an English schooner, without attainting his discoverer & cabinmate with a charge of conspiracy. The savage’s breathing told me he was sleeping. I was tempted to make a dash for the door & howl for help, but in the eyes of God my word was my bond, even to an Indian.

The cacophony of timbers creaking, of masts swaying, of ropes flexing, of canvas clapping, of feet on decks, of goats bleating, of rats scuttling, of the pumps beating, of the bell dividing the watches, of melees & laughter from the fo’c’sle, of orders, of windlass shanties & of Tethys’ eternal realm; all lulled me as I calculated how best I could convince Cpt. Molyneux of my innocence in Mr. D’Arnoq’s plot (now I must be more vigilant than ever that this diary should not be read by unfriendly eyes) when a falsetto yell, beginning far off but speeding nearer at a crossbolt’s velocity, was silenced by the deck, mere inches above where I lay.

Such a terrible finality! Prone I lay, shocked & rigid, forgetting to breathe."
B000SEGUDE1,B000SEGUDE,"Henry regretted he lacked the time & apparatus for a compleat diagnosis, but recommended, upon my return to San Francisco, I find a specialist in tropical parasites as a matter of urgency. (I could not bring myself to tell him there are none.)

I slumber not.

Thursday, 14th November—

We make sail with the morning tide. I am once more aboard the Prophetess, but I cannot pretend it is good to be back. My coffin now stores three great coils of hawser, which I must scale to attain my bunk, for not one inch of floor is visible. Mr. D’Arnoq sold half a dozen barrels of sundry provisions to the quartermaster & a bolt of sailcloth (much to Walker’s disgust). He came aboard to supervise their delivery & collect payment himself & bid me Godspeed. In my coffin we were squeezed like two men in a pothole, so we repaired to the deck for it is a pleasant evening. After discussing divers matters we shook hands & he climbed down to his waiting ketch, ably crewed by two young manservants of mongrel race.

Mr. Roderick has little sympathy with my petition to have the offending hawser removed elsewhere, for he is obliged to quit his private cabin (for the reason stated below) & move to the fo’c’sle with the common sailors, whose number has swollen with five Castilians"
B00M1WRTDG0,B00M1WRTDG,"After a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few illusions left. Religion for her was a habit, and she suspected that a man of her husband's age would not change greatly before death. She was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his accident and, but that she did not wish to seem bloody-minded, would have told the gentlemen that Mr. Kernan's tongue would not suffer by being shortened. However, Mr. Cunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion. The scheme might do good and, at least, it could do no harm. Her beliefs were not extravagant. She believed steadily in the Sacred Heart as the most generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments. Her faith was bounded by her kitchen, but, if she was put to it, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost.

The gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr. Cunningham said that he had once known a similar case. A man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again, so that no one could see a trace of the bite."
B00M1WRTDG1,B00M1WRTDG,"He was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his friends, Mr. Cunningham, Mr. M'Coy and Mr. Power had disclosed to Mrs. Kernan in the parlour. The idea had been Mr. Power's, but its development was entrusted to Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Kernan came of Protestant stock and, though he had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his marriage, he had not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years. He was fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism.

Mr. Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He was an elder colleague of Mr. Power. His own domestic life was not very happy. People had great sympathy with him, for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard. He had set up house for her six times; and each time she had pawned the furniture on him.

Everyone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a thoroughly sensible man, influential and intelligent. His blade of human knowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy. He was well informed. His friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like Shakespeare's."
B01HAQMW480,B01HAQMW48,"I’ve spent the last few weeks trying to find a way to make ends meet. I start to make progress, get one thing paid off, only to learn about a half dozen new credit cards that he took out in my name. Thanks to online accounts, all he needed was my social and date of birth. I’m legally responsible for all of it. It’s a never-ending nightmare that I can’t wake from.

I stand, grab my purse, and walk out without another word. Nothing I can say will change anything. My kids and I will be homeless, we’re broke, and we have no other option. I can’t get a loan with no income and ruined credit. And I don’t have time to explore other options.

Once I arrive back home, I look around feeling conflicted. I don’t want to leave, but I also don’t want to be here. The boys don’t understand why I sleep on the couch most nights. But being in that king-size bed reminds me that he left.

Slowly, I climb the stairs to my bedroom. I remove the pearl earrings, which Todd bought me on our wedding day, and clutch them in my hand, feeling the prick from the backs before I launch them across the room."
B01HAQMW481,B01HAQMW48,"I repeat this process until I’m not on the verge of a panic attack.

Angie cries with me, letting out her own sounds of devastation. We clutch each other and mourn the loss of a man we love.

Twenty minutes later, just as Angie and I have settled together and calmed into quiet weeping, the paramedics appear on the staircase. A black bag lies on the gurney, holding the man I planned to grow old with, the father of my children, and all the hopes of the life I’d imagined. No more dinners. No more kisses. No more laughs can be shared between us. Because he decided he couldn’t. And I don’t even know why.

We have a beautiful home, stable jobs, smart and healthy kids. I’m so confused. I keep waiting for Todd to walk down the stairs and tell me it’s all going to be okay.

I stand, staring at the blackness that fills my view.

The emptiness drains the parts of me that were once so full. It takes over the hope I once had, making it black and ugly. They wheel him out as I crumple to the floor. Angie rushes over to me, enveloping me in her arms, and holds on."
B01N2GOLUT0,B01N2GOLUT,"But a man willing to sacrifice freedom to save his friend surely had honour running through his veins. Besides, Lord Morford was a kind, affable soul, not at all the sort to associate with a scoundrel.

Priscilla sighed.

There was little point trying to convince herself of Mr Chandler’s suitability now.

In truth, she found his rugged charm appealing. An air of mystery radiated from his persona. The dangerous glint in his eye made her heart miss a beat.

Still, none of those things accounted for her decision to accept his proposal.

The real reason sounded foolish when she examined its merit. But something about him seemed familiar. It was as though they shared a connection in ways she could not explain. If she closed her eyes, she could picture every line, every mark or imperfection on his handsome face. When he’d kissed her, well, the essence of the man proved potent. It drew her to him in some inexplicable way.

The sound of approaching footsteps disturbed her fanciful musings.

Priscilla shrank back into the shadows and held her breath. Mr Chandler strode into the concealed garden via the topiary arch. With a straight spine and an arrogant grin, he held out the thick wool travelling cloak."
B01N2GOLUT1,B01N2GOLUT,"Now, she was to learn that the place she called home no longer belonged to her family. After such heavy losses at the card table, her aunt and uncle would surely struggle to keep themselves from the workhouse.

Chapter 2

Holding the torn bodice to her chest, Priscilla waited near the fountain for Mr Chandler to return. The gown mirrored her reputation: soiled, ruined, ripped to tatters. A mere hour ago life held a wealth of possibilities. The flash of admiration in Mr Mercer’s eyes while dancing the cotillion led her to conclude the mild flirtation might blossom into something more.

But Lady Morford had played Priscilla like a worthless pawn in a game of chess.

Thank the Lord, Mr Chandler saw fit to wreak havoc with the spiteful woman’s plan. Like a knight of old, the gentleman had stepped forward to offer his hand, to drag her bloodied and bruised from the battlefield and promise protection.

Not even Lady Morford could have anticipated his move.

Priscilla knew little of Mr Chandler’s character, other than he owned a rather grand townhouse and was an exceptional host — or so people said. The matrons spun tales of a reckless rogue. A gentleman unfit for timid debutantes."
B0727NCDH40,B0727NCDH4,"It was obvious Lovecraft and Carter did not have the first fucking idea how to make everything go back as it was so, yeah, that was just peachy keen and grounds for bubbling optimism for sure.

It was all he had, though, and he’d take that pinch of hope and work to put things back how they should be. Neil Armstrong deserved it.

He put away his badge, looked at the computer screen on his desk at Arkham Central, read some of the crime reports, and sighed. Folded or not, the world contained some real assholes.

* * *

The following day, Emily Lovecraft was back in Providence. No … back in Arkham. It still took an effort to use the name even after the months they had spent living in this world, which was different in gross and subtle ways. It was still easy to be depressed and angry that the Nazis were still around and that nobody understood why this was a thing to be depressed and angry about. What was more insidious, however, was how politics and attitudes had slid over a few notches to accommodate this new world order.

For one thing, it was like twenty years of social progress had gone up in smoke. Antisemitism was reflexive and commonplace."
B0727NCDH41,B0727NCDH4,"An actual Nazi moon base. And a Nazi space station orbiting the Earth.

The first man in space had been a Nazi. The first man on the moon had been a Nazi. Nobody knew who the fuck Neil Armstrong was. That steamed Harrelson, who’d always admired Armstrong’s quiet heroism.

Living in the Unfolded World meant he couldn’t get drunk in company, because God only knew what might slip out. Yeah, the Cold War was all about the USSR. Remember when the Berlin Wall came down? That was crazy talk now. He’d got drunk by himself a couple of times, but he didn’t like where that was headed, so now he only drank with people who understood. All two of them, and he wasn’t sure if he liked them that much, either.

The details were vague, but he kind of had the idea this was Carter’s fault, though Lovecraft said things would be a bunch worse if it hadn’t been for him. How worse? Well, just as bad, really, in terms of the day-to-day. But there would be no hope to put things back as they were if Carter hadn’t done something they were real vague about, so that was something, wasn’t it?"
B009NG20H80,B009NG20H8,"You can take all the shrinks in the world and throw them off a bridge. Who sits around all day listening to people carp and whine? People who can’t figure out what else to do with themselves, that’s who. They say, Oh, I’m fascinated by human behavior. Yeah, right. They take other people’s problems and other people’s money and they feel better about themselves. Oh, look! I’m not so screwed up! Oh, look! I’m rich! Please. Just my opinion. On the other hand, I’d been told by some very reputable people who are very high up in the firm that these guys are the best. We’ll see about that.

The one good thing I can say so far about this psychiatrist or whatever she calls herself, a relationship therapist, is that she’s punctual, which is good because time is a valuable commodity. I really hate to be kept waiting. It makes me nuts. And she’s got great legs, but let’s keep that between us. I’ve got enough trouble as it is. My friend who’s a lawyer says if this doesn’t go right, this business with Les could cost me big-time.

The doctor came around from behind her desk and took a seat in the chair opposite me."
B009NG20H81,B009NG20H8,"Meanwhile, I stood there evaluating her neck and eyebrows and lack of jowls, wondering who her plastic surgeon is because she looks amazing. Not that I’m a devotee of cosmetic surgery, but like every woman over thirty, okay fifty, I think about it from time to time. Okay, a lot. I think about it a lot these days. Then I thought, She’s got to be sixty but her face is forty, and somehow it’s not stretched tight like a snare drum. She was as skinny as a hanger, which would explain why the dress she was wearing looked so fabulous on her. I recognized it from some ad I had recently seen. Maybe it was Chanel. No matter. Still, she must’ve spent three thousand dollars on that bit of silk whimsy and lace and at least another thousand on the shoes.

My inner voice piped up to tell me that all the money in the world can’t buy happiness, and I told my inner voice she was an idiot. Money might not buy happiness, but not having any was just about guaranteed to make you miserable, unless you had the soul of Mother Teresa of Calcutta, which I did not. I was conflicted about some issues and certain of others."
B0798PH1BG0,B0798PH1BG,"Lin could've done with getting something to eat but there was no way there was time for that. She'd just have to go hungry till later. It wouldn't kill her. She'd been hungry for most of her life and survived.

Lin reached the courtyard just as the main clock started to chime the hour. She picked up speed across the gravel, swerving to avoid a priest who stepped in her path without realizing it. She heard him complain that she shouldn't be there, but again that was nothing new. For men of God, they weren't very charitable. The moment she thought it, she knew she wasn't being fair. They'd looked after her, given her a home after Jack had rescued her from Grosnar. They just didn't like a woman being amongst them.

A small group had gathered around the memorial flame in the center of the courtyard, paying respect to the dead whose names were immortalized in the stone. Lin felt a flash of guilt for not slowing down as she passed them, but she had somewhere to be.

She reached the path to the practice hall and he waited at the end of it, leaning heavily on his cane. Master Snow."

Lin

Lin was late. She'd spent too much time watching the snow fall from her cottage window like some silly child. She pulled on her boots and grabbed her coat, cursing herself. It wasn't as if she had anything else to do that day after all.

Her cottage was tucked away in the grounds of the monastery at Whitehaven, far enough from the main buildings to ensure she had to run if she was going to be on time. Knowing her luck, she'd slip on some ice and break something, but Lin didn't slow down. Some risks were worth it.

She flew past a group of students, with their shaved heads and grey uniforms, ignored their stares and open mouths. She knew they all talked about her — bad enough she was the only woman in a monastery with over five hundred men and boys, but once you took into account she was the only person born and raised in the Middle Kingdoms to ever come to Whitehaven, Lin was notorious.

She jumped over a small hedgerow, and then cut down by the back of the mess hall."
B0054TVWFY0,B0054TVWFY,"He smoked cigars, and often mentions his wine-dealers in letters, and the brandy, gin, port, sherry, champagne, claret and Sauternes delivered and enjoyed; and although he was very rarely the worse for drink, he sometimes confessed to feeling bad in the mornings after overindulging the night before. Raspberries were his favourite fruit, served without cream, and he was very fond of dates in boxes.9 He belonged to the Garrick Club and the Athenaeum, and he knew and frequented all the theatres in London and could ask any of their managers for a box when he wanted one. Eating out, going to the theatre, adventuring through the rough areas of London with a friend or two were habitual ways of spending his evening. He also walked the streets by himself, observing and thinking. He was passionately interested in prisons and in asylums, the places where society’s rejects are kept.

He revisited the Marylebone Workhouse ten years later, in May 1850,10 when it held 2,000 inmates of all ages from newborn to dying, and wrote a painfully vivid account of the place: the smell of so many people kept in wards together, the listlessness, the dreary diet, the sullen lethargy of the old who had nothing to look forward to except death."
B0054TVWFY1,B0054TVWFY,"This was Dickens nearly halfway through his life: he was twenty-eight in February 1840, and had another thirty years ahead of him. He was living in a country that had been at peace for a quarter of a century. There had been no foreign wars, and no revolution at home, partly thanks to the Reform Bill of 1832, passed under the old King, William IV, in which parliamentary constituencies were redrawn and the electorate widened, cautiously. But the courts and alleys of London remained squalid with poverty, overcrowding and disease, and the rich in their great houses were unshaken. Railways were changing the habits of the nation more than votes, and railway stations at Euston and Paddington already connected London to the north and the West Country. New Oxford Street had just been cut, and the Finchley Road, the Caledonian and Camden Road, and Charles Barry was designing Trafalgar Square. In January the penny post was established, covering the whole country: in its first year it would double the volume of letters written. London was preparing for a royal wedding on 10 February, when the young Queen Victoria was to be married to a German prince, Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In parliament there was a debate over what allowance should be paid to the foreign Prince."
B06XD69BGT0,B06XD69BGT,"The ridicule they received from colleagues, however, was always plentiful. In no time, they had learned a difficult lesson that in the academic world, few subjects were more deadly to one’s professional career. And it hadn’t been long before the snickers led to money troubles. Within a year, the funding had dried up and Hiddenger had been forced into retirement, a broken and bitter man.

A tap on his shoulder yanked Anders from his thoughts. Beside him, Binh was pointing out the window toward a magnificent sight. The sky was streaked with bands of red, orange and yellow as the sun slowly slipped from view. Anders found himself grinning at the sight, eager to replace the memory of Hiddenger’s disgrace. But that wasn’t what Binh wanted him to see. His Vietnamese friend motioned again, this time down toward the cobalt-blue ocean beneath them. Anders leaned in and his jaw went slack.

In the distance and growing larger by the second was Genesis’ majestic research ship, the Excelsior. Sleek and gleaming white, it looked like something out of Greek mythology. Anders pressed his face up against the glass like a kid peering through a toy store window, a single envious desire settling on his lips."
B06XD69BGT1,B06XD69BGT,"Despite Schliemann’s questionable methods, his eventual success had been a source of joy for the man and an embarrassment for the supposedly learned academics who had doubted him.

Much like Schliemann, Hiddenger had turned to Plato’s Socratic dialogue Timaeus as a starting point for his own search. In one short section, Critias had described Solon, the great lawgiver, meeting with a group of Egyptian priests where he was told of Atlantis.

According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful island nation whose capital city was said to be a series of concentric rings, each thicker than the last. Over the years the men of Atlantis had sought to enslave those living nearby until a violent cataclysm destroyed them and all of their ambitions in a single day.

If the advanced seagoing civilization Plato described was more than just a myth, the most likely candidate was the Greek island of Santorini. At least, that was how Hiddenger saw it. The volcanic eruption which had devastated Santorini in 1600BC certainly made it an interesting candidate, not to mention the similarities in soil makeup as outlined by Plato. Despite several exhaustive explorations in and around the island, any concrete link with Atlantis continued to elude them."
B004KABELU0,B004KABELU,"When he found pagan signs scratched on his path one morning, he recorded them in his notebooks, thus:

Theophilus imagined he recorded this in a scientific spirit, and even if he was meticulous in rendering the exact proportion of the sign, he was not a dispassionate observer. The sign frightened him. And just as he had seen a mockery of the crucifixion at the wassailing, he now saw a heathen assault upon the sanctity of the cross.

He could not leave it. He must tilt at it. But where to tilt he was not sure. He walked all the way to Morley, briskly, imagining he would find someone in the public house. It was Bargus he had in mind, he who had been a warrener and was now the sexton. But when he entered the Swan at Morley he found it completely empty. He turned around and walked back, four miles across the fields.

Theophilus was agitated at the time he had wasted. He was completing the illustrations for his Corals of Devon. He must produce two drawings every day, to meet his deadline. Today he had done no drawings, except this sacrilegious symbol. He was out of breath when he climbed over the stile at Hennacombe and saw Bargus sitting on the little stone bridge which was built across the stream there."
B004KABELU1,B004KABELU,"Sometimes he wished only to lie on the bed and embrace his son, to put his nose into his clean, washed hair, to make a human cage around him, to protect his bird-frail body from harm; and what pride, he thought, what arrogance that would be.

For Oscar was already given to God. He was one of the elect. The mysteries of salvation had been divinely revealed to him. He had laid hold on Christ and would not be cast into hellfire. All this had been vouchsafed him.

And when he made himself think this last thought, Theophilus would feel the tension leave him. The muscles in his chest and upper arms would go soft and his breathing would become deeper and more regular. In his mind’s eye he saw his own blood oxygenating, turning a deep and brilliant red. He stretched and felt the blood tingle in his hitherto clenched fingers.

What a miracle Thou hast wrought.

He bent over his son and kissed the air above his forehead and then walked on tiptoe in that slightly exaggerated and silly way that men like Theophilus, normally gruff and bustling about their business, adopt as a sort of dance to celebrate their most tender feelings.

This was in Devon, near Torquay."
B00BDQ399Y0,B00BDQ399Y,"Such artwork was a feast for my eyes, and I planned to spend many an hour over the next few days devouring their canvases, dissecting the pieces to discover just how the various artists had achieved their effects. It had been quite some time since I had been given the opportunity to study another’s artwork — I had long ago exhausted the paintings at Gairloch Castle of their educational value— and I felt a thrill at the chance to do so now.

Philip and Alana joined me in my examination of the beautiful chamber. Black-and-white tiles covered the floor, leading to the creamy marble of the staircase and the red runner trailing up the center of each riser. The stair rail was molded in black rod iron and topped with warm oak. The furniture positioned in the room had appropriately been kept to a minimum. Two red wingback chairs and a round table topped with a floral arrangement of fragrant asters and bellflowers were all that occupied the space.

As we stood absorbing our surroundings, a man rushed in to greet us through a door on the left, his footfalls echoing off the walls of the cavernous chamber. A wide, boyish grin flashed across his face, summoning an answering smile to my own."
B00BDQ399Y1,B00BDQ399Y,"But for a few wrinkles in her skirts and the paleness of her complexion, one would never have known she had fallen ill again after luncheon. My appearance was all the more shabby for the stark comparison, in an old russet brown dress with tendrils of hair escaping their pins to trail down my back, per usual. Even had Alana not soiled my two best traveling ensembles, I still would have appeared a bedraggled mess next to her. It was not that I was unkempt; I simply could not be bothered to notice or care that my hair was mussed or my gown wrinkled, until it was too late to alter the opinions of the people scowling at me. As was the case now.

An expression of disdain flickered briefly in the Dalmay butler’s eyes as he stared down his rather hawkish nose at me before he ushered us into the entryway. Ignoring the servant’s condescension, I handed him my cloak, bonnet, and gloves and moved toward the stone archway leading into the entry hall.

My eyes widened in appreciation. The soaring two-story chamber was topped with a decorative hammer-beam ceiling, and its walls were covered in portraits of the Dalmay family ’s many noble ancestors."
B079SD61QQ0,B079SD61QQ,"Isabella shot up from her seat and shoved the table away to reach Carlo, who sat wide eyed and gurgling. Carlo cupped his neck, but the blood flowed through his fingers in a scarlet fountain that wouldn’t stop until it ran dry.

It was too late.

Someone had fired a kill shot.

A waitress screamed and dropped a tray of drinks, the glass shattering across the floor as the guests dining on the terrace scraped their seats back and ran for cover.

Carlo’s detail sprang into action. Two grabbed Stefano by the arms and dragged him away from his dying father. Isabella went without a fuss, her face pale and splattered red. The rest of the men picked up a squirming Carlo and carried him inside the building to the covered safety of the restaurant. A guard stood at either end with their gun raised and eyes on the lookout for the culprit.

They weren’t the only ones.

Maggie and Leon ducked behind one of the large potted plants for cover in case the shooter wasn’t finished.

She scanned beyond the terrace, searching to the west based on the location of the entry wound in Carlo’s neck. Her heart drummed in her ears, and Leon held a protective arm over her as she narrowed in on the gunman."
B079SD61QQ1,B079SD61QQ,"She would have preferred to scope out the area personally, but given the time restraints and the fact Rebecca’s presence could raise questions she didn’t want to answer, she settled for digital.

The entrance was right on the Grand Canal, about halfway between her suite at the Gritti and the Rialto Bridge. Guido had arranged for transport, courtesy of the hotel of course. Maggie and Leon stepped out from the boat into the hotel’s arched waterfront entrance and were each greeted with a bubbling glass of champagne.

Maggie tugged at Rebecca’s fitted white suit, feeling confined in the expensive fabric. She was more of a t-shirt and jeans kind of girl and enjoyed lounging around her apartment in her pajamas on days off. At least she didn’t have to wear a dress or force her feet into a pair of heels. Rebecca preferred flats, having learned early on that dressing with a masculine edge made men take her more seriously.

A waitress led them upstairs to the restaurant on the roof ’s terrace. Wrought iron chairs were tucked under round tables, surrounded by large pots with twisted trees canopying over them to create an intimate environment for guests. Beyond, the terrace looked out to the tops of surrounding buildings, a mass of close knit roofs crowned with terracotta tiles."
B06XTP72V80,B06XTP72V8,"No ship captain should do either of those things, in her opinion. Leadership was about others, not self.

Victoria’s opinion of the ship’s captain had not improved over the last year that she’d been assigned to his command. Now she stood outside the captain’s cabin door, eyes closed momentarily, summoning the patience to put up with this bullshit for another night. She could hear the voices inside. She opened her eyes and saw that the red light was on. Like a traffic light, the captain had a light installed outside his door that would switch between green and red, to signify when it was acceptable for ship’s personnel to enter. He always kept it red.

The silly part of that was that he couldn’t bring himself to delegate. He demanded that his personnel update him constantly. He had standing orders to be informed of every minute detail of the ship’s activities, wanting to make as many decisions as possible. As a result, his officers grew used to not making decisions themselves, and the captain almost never slept more than an hour at a time and was perpetually in a bad mood.

Dealing with this ship’s captain was part of the job, however. She took a breath and knocked on the door."
B06XTP72V81,B06XTP72V8,"Free from flying, Juan typed a few keystrokes into his multipurpose display and saw the radar image that AWR1 was bringing up.

The crew of three was flying an MH-60R helicopter about one hundred and fifty miles off the coast of Central America. The deployment was supposed to have been a counternarcotics operation — they should have been looking for speedboats full of cocaine and other drugs on their way to Mexico. Instead, the Navy had seen fit to assign them to an international training exercise. Most of the participants were from Central and South America. Farragut was the only US Navy ship.

Most of the last two hours had been spent performing over-water surveillance—flying circles in a pitch-black sky that could only exist over a hazy and humid ocean. The dark night sky was occasionally lit up by lightning from a band of thunderstorms that had been steadily getting closer throughout the flight.

While Juan normally loved watching summer thunderstorms roll over his home in Atlantic Beach, Florida, he was significantly less comfortable tonight. Watching thunderstorms from the comfort of your covered porch was one thing. Dodging them at a few thousand feet over the water was another.

AWR1 Fetternut made calls from his radar scope in the back of the helicopter."
B00CJK8LIW0,B00CJK8LIW,"He told us that Miss Penrod had an envelope in her hand when she left Mrs. Jarvis’s. Mr. Silverman said that it was quite common for Miss Penrod to visit Mrs. Nelson. He had no idea if Miss Penrod was Mrs. Nelson’s first visitor of the day, but he did know that Mr. Hartley entered the house with the mail before Miss Penrod left.

I asked Mr. Silverman who left the house first, but the nosy neighbor didn’t know because he’d left the window.

When I asked Mr. Silverman why he left the window, I got the impression he was lying when he told us his phone had rung. As Mr. Silverman said this, he looked at his feet. I looked at them too and noticed the dirt on his shoes. From the looks of his shoes, the dirt had not been there long, and I doubt if he got his shoes dirty as he looked out his window or talked on the phone. But why would the man lie to us?

Mr. Silverman told us he later returned to the window and saw Miss Penrod leave her own house in a taxi. Mr. Silverman chuckled as he related this to Lou and me."
B00CJK8LIW1,B00CJK8LIW,"Lou noticed him too, and the two of us headed down to intercept the man before he set foot upon the crime scene.

If I’m honest, I have to admit that it irritated me that this unbecoming man, who appeared to be only a few years my junior, had no trouble navigating the steps. His stride coming up the steps equaled our jaunt heading down them.

We encountered our visitor about half-way up the steps. I stood and eyed the stranger, Dodge City style. None of us spoke immediately. The man had thin light brown hair and a wimpy mustache. At least there was a wisp of hair on his lip. He wore glasses with ugly yellow-brown frames, a white sport shirt with geometrical figures on it, and an unbuttoned, tan cardigan sweater which allowed us to see all six, cheap, ball point pens that were stuffed into the protector that protruded from the shirt’s pocket. I could see nothing to distinguish our visitor from any other wimp. The new arrival appeared to be around five-foot-eight inches tall, and his light brown wingtips seemed to be a size eight or thereabouts. The fact that he stood two steps below me made him seem even shorter.

Finally, our unwelcome visitor broke the silence."
B0792GGZSG0,B0792GGZSG,"It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.

Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.

Chapter 6

Monday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found him so — because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.

Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose."
B0792GGZSG1,B0792GGZSG,"But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.

By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing."
B01NBH4NZI0,B01NBH4NZI,"I found myself walking towards Brompton Cemetery and although it was late and I knew the main gates would be closed, I also knew from previous visits that there was a point in the wall on the Lillie Road where the stones had come loose and you could crawl through quite easily on your hands and knees.

This I did, the palms of my hands gathering up bits of twig and pine cone and leaving a latticed indentation of dirt across my skin. I stood, brushing myself clean. A piece of lichen had lodged itself in my hair. I shook it out.

The cemetery stood in the gloom of night, half lit here and there by a weak streetlamp. Gravestones and silhouetted stone angels loomed out of the shadows. Some notable historical figures were buried nearby although I’d never tried to seek out their graves. My favourite gravestone (if one can have such a thing) was to mark the passing of a young man called Horace Brass who died at the age of sixteen in 1910. His name was carved in looped art nouveau cursive.

I started walking towards it, hands in my pockets. A man fell into step beside me. I glanced to one side and saw that, no, this was not a man but a boy. A teenage boy, like Horace Brass, pale and thin as a silver birch. He had greasy hair and spots around his mouth."
B01NBH4NZI1,B01NBH4NZI,"At first, it was just a hurried sandwich in the staff canteen but soon we graduated to the restaurant across the road from the office where we sat in wooden booths and drank wine from a magnum that the waiter would mark off at the end of the meal, charging us according to how many inches we had drunk. It was only a matter of time before lunch turned into an after-work drink in the pub – me: a pint of Guinness; Lucy: a gin and tonic. (I never liked Guinness. I only drank it when I was trying to give the impression of blokeishness.) After six months, we were having dinner. We both had a penchant for Persian food and would seek out the best places for a night-time meal of aubergine stew and lamb with barberries at the wrong end of Kensington.

And then she kissed me and I didn’t know how to say no. It was on the pavement outside a brightly painted eatery called Tas or Yaz or Fez or something similar. We were standing under a streetlamp, dank drizzle coating our faces like wet muslin and I found myself looking at her face, at the speckles of moisture on her unfashionably large glasses, at the discreet jiggle of extra flesh just underneath her chin, at the double freckle on the lobe of one ear so that it looked as if she had got them pierced even though she was one of the few women of my acquaintance who hadn’t."
B01CBLUS5C0,B01CBLUS5C,"THE NEXUS WAS a broad, gracious space, framed in the same brushed metal and wood of the Transportation Center. Restaurants, shops, souvenir boutiques, and Guest Services lounges lined the walls to the left and right, stretching ahead for what seemed a limitless distance. Warne followed the others down the monorail off-loading ramp, Georgia in tow, gazing about curiously. The ceiling was open to the glass dome far above, framing a huge cloudless sky that arced over the Nexus in a brilliant azure band. Before him, information kiosks and low, graceful fountains gleamed in the slanted bars of sunlight. Signs, large but discreet, directed visitors toward the Park’s four Worlds: Camelot, Gaslight, Boardwalk, Callisto. The air was cool, a little moist, and full of muted sound— voices, the patter of water, some softer noise he couldn’t identify.

A group of youngish men and women were waiting at the base of the ramp. They wore identical white blazers and carried identical folders. They looked, in fact, as if they could have all been related. Warne wondered, only half in jest, if there were height, weight, and age restrictions for Utopia employees. He dismissed the thought as he saw one of the women walking briskly toward him."
B01CBLUS5C1,B01CBLUS5C,"Though the monorail had not yet left the Center, the heavyset man was looking around busily, his pasty, heavy-browed face a mask of excitement and anticipation.

Warne let Georgia take the window seat, then slid in beside her. Almost before they were seated, a low chime sounded and the doors came noiselessly together. There was a brief lurch, followed by silky acceleration. Welcome to the Utopia monorail, a female voice said from everywhere and nowhere. It was not the usual voice Warne had heard on public address systems: instead, it was rich, sophisticated, with a trace of a British accent. Travel time to the Nexus will be approximately eight minutes and thirty seconds. For your safety and comfort, we ask that you remain in your seats for the duration of the ride.

Suddenly, brilliant light bathed the compartment as the Center fell away behind them. Ahead and above, dual monorail tracks curved gently through a narrow sandstone canyon. Warne glanced down quickly, then almost snatched his feet away in surprise. What he had supposed to be a solid floor was actually a series of glass panels. Below him was now an unobstructed drop of perhaps a hundred feet to the rocky canyon floor. He took a deep breath and looked away."
B00KQY2EC20,B00KQY2EC2,"For once it was high in the sky and not hidden behind grimy clouds and belching smoke-filled air.

That was when she saw him. Sitting on a park bench, his head lolled back as if his neck could snap with the weight of it. It wasn’t like she hadn’t seen a soldier before. Almost all of the boys she’d grown up with or known from the neighborhood were off fighting in the war; indeed, the only young men she’d seen of late had been soldiers. But he was different.

June had heard talk of the American soldiers, even seen a few of them, or heard them wolf-whistling out to the girls when they passed. They wore uniforms that looked clean and crisp, not quite freshly laundered, but close. They would stand on street corners chewing gum, talking in their drawling accents.

This young man looked just like them, in his five-button uniform jacket, but he wasn’t moving an inch and he was all alone.

June didn’t know what to do. It was only a few minutes’ walk to her house, but she didn’t want to just leave him there. Couldn’t just leave him there. He was a soldier, from an allied country, so it wouldn’t be right to just ignore him. Would it?"
B00KQY2EC21,B00KQY2EC2,"Alice was confident and beautiful, and while that might have intimidated her at home, being under Alice’s wing on a ship full of strangers was strangely comforting.

The beat of heels on the wooden deck was deafening, the sway of the ship as it moved out into deeper ocean already sending unwelcome rumbles through her stomach. Betty Olliver pressed one hand to her belly and tried to focus on breathing. In and out, she reminded herself, but it wasn’t as easy as that. She had forced her oversized stomach in tightly under her blouse with the help of a corset, terrified one of the authorities would notice her pregnancy, and while she was pretty sure she’d gotten away undetected, it was making her feel faint. So faint she had a feeling she was about to keel overboard.

Betty grasped a nearby railing and wished she could just let her waist out from its restraints. She’d been determined not to wait around at home and give birth without her husband nearby, but now she was starting to feel differently. Very differently indeed.

When the letter had arrived telling her it was time to depart, there was no chance she was going to be left behind. But now . . ."
B000FC1V2Y0,B000FC1V2Y,"All this he was glad to do but for Doc, as Elmwood Springs’ only pharmacist, it meant that he was also privy to private information and secrets he sometimes wished he didn’t have to know. With his knowledge of medicine he often knew exactly what was wrong with people by what the doctor had prescribed.

He was painfully aware, for example, that his best friend had a bad heart condition by the strength of the medicine and by the frequency it was to be taken but he never mentioned it. He also knew that poor Tot Whooten had been given a prescription for Antabuse and she was secretly slipping it into the coffee of her husband, James Dwayne, every morning to try to get him to stop drinking. He knew which soldier had come home from the war having contracted syphilis, what lady was taking pills for bad nerves, which men were being treated for impotence, and those women who were having female trouble, as well as who did not want any more children and who did. All this he kept to himself. It was especially hard when his own family was involved. The day his father’s prescription for morphine was called in he knew his dad was dying, long before his father did."
B000FC1V2Y1,B000FC1V2Y,"He was the proud owner of a real, genuine World Series baseball, a foul ball his father had managed to catch, autographed by none other than the National League’s MVP of the year, shortstop Marty Marion. Bobby and his dad stood in line for about two hours to get the autograph but it was worth the wait. When they got home Bobby showed it to everybody. He was quite the big man around town for a few days, or at least until everyone had seen it several times. As for Doc, he came home happy and rested, a rest he had much needed.

On the surface, being a small-town druggist did not seem like such a hard job, certainly not a hazardous or a grueling profession. But it had its own hidden stresses that few knew about. His was a multifaceted job of many duties. Not only did he have to stand and listen with great patience to everybody in town who seemed compelled to tell him in long, drawn-out detail all about each and every little pain or complaint they had, but people also brought him birds with broken wings to fix, kids with cuts and scrapes, smashed fingers, and sprained ankles to bandage, and a variety of colds, upset stomachs, sore throats, cat scratches, dog bites, black eyes, and poison ivy rashes to ask about."
